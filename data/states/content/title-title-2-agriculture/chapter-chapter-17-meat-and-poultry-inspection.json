If any valuable constituent has been, in whole or in part, omitted or abstracted therefrom or if any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part, therefor or if damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner or if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength or make it appear of greater value than it is; or\n\nl. If it is margarine containing animal fat and any of the raw material used therein consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid or decomposed substance.\n\n(13) MISBRANDED.

If it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity or composition has been prescribed by regulations of the commissioner under Section 2-17-10, unless it conforms to such definition and standard and its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by such regulations, the common names of optional ingredients (other than spices, flavoring and coloring) present in such food;\n\nh.

      "text": "Section 2-17-2\n\nLegislative Findings of Fact and Declaration of Policy; Purpose and Construction of Chapter Generally; Adoption and Promulgation of Regulations Promulgated Under Certain Federal Acts.\n\n(a) Meat and meat food products are an important source of the nation’s total supply of food. It is essential to the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated or misbranded meat or meat food products are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, misbranded or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated and properly labeled and packaged articles to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the commissioner and cooperation by this state and the United States as contemplated by this chapter are appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise effectuate the purposes of this chapter; therefore, the intent and purpose of this chapter is to authorize, provide and require a meat and poultry inspection program in this state which will be no less equal to the provisions and requirements of applicable federal laws which authorize and provide for such inspection and related duties in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States as directed under Section 2-17-25. Accordingly, it is hereby intended that this chapter shall be liberally construed and interpreted insofar as possible to be consistent with such declared intent and purpose.\n\n(b) Wherever in this chapter it is provided that regulations or orders may or shall be promulgated by the commissioner with approval of the Board of Agriculture and Industries, such officials are authorized to adopt and promulgate any regulations as may have been or may hereafter be promulgated under authority of the federal Meat Inspection Act and the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act, amendments thereto or other appropriate or related federal laws, insofar as possible, to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and to administer and enforce its provisions and requirements.\n\n(Acts 1969, No. 1049, p. 1939, §2; Acts 1971, No. 2252, p. 3622, §3.)",

Any such determination by the commissioner shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice of the final determination, the person, firm, or corporation adversely affected files a complaint in the circuit court of the county wherein the person, firm, or corporation so using the questioned marking, labeling, or container resides or has his or her or its principal place of business, and the court is hereby vested with jurisdiction and it shall be its duty to set the matter for hearing upon 30 days’ written notice to the commissioner and to take testimony and examine the facts of the case and to determine, without the intervention of a jury, whether or not the questioned marking or labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use with respect to any article subject to this chapter is false or misleading in any particular, and the determination shall, in the absence of fraud, corruption, bad faith, or gross abuse of discretion, be final.\n\n(Acts 1969, No. 1049, p. 1939, §7; Acts 1971, No. 2252, p. 3622, §4; Act 2019-310, §1.)",

Such writ of attachment for condemnation shall issue upon the sworn complaint of the commissioner or his duly authorized agent, taken by an officer authorized to administer an oath, to the effect that such carcass, part of a carcass, meat or meat food product or poultry food product is adulterated or misbranded or, having been required so to be by this chapter, has not been inspected and examined in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Said sworn complaint by said commissioner or his duly authorized agent may be amended at any stage of the proceedings.

Any such party may demand a jury trial of any issue of fact to be determined in the proceedings instituted under this section; and, in case a jury trial is demanded, the judgment entered by the court shall be in accordance with the facts as found by such jury; provided, however, that the verdict of the jury may be set aside by the court where manifestly contrary to the evidence or the law.\n\n(b) If the article or animal is condemned, it shall, after entry of the judgment, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the Treasury of this state, but the article or animals shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the federal Meat Inspection Act or the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; provided, that upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the article or animal shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of the United States, the court may direct that such article or animal be delivered to the owner thereof subject to such supervision by authorized representatives of the commissioner as is necessary to insure compliance with the applicable laws.

Any of the courts designated in Section 2-17-30 within the jurisdiction of which inquiry is carried on may, in case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, firm or corporation, issue an order requiring such person, firm or corporation to appear before the commissioner or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter in question, and any failure to obey such order or any such court shall be punished by such court as contempt thereof.\n\n(c) Upon application of the Attorney General of this state at the request of the commissioner, the circuit courts of the several counties of this state shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person, firm or corporation to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any order of the commissioner made in pursuance of this chapter.\n\n(d) The commissioner may order testimony to be taken by deposition in any proceeding or investigation pending under this chapter at any stage of such proceeding or investigation. Such depositions may be taken before any person designated by the commissioner and having power to administer oaths. Such testimony shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition or under his direction and shall then be subscribed by the deponent. Any person may be compelled to appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the commissioner as provided in this section.\n\n(e) Witnesses summoned before the commissioner shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in such courts.\n\n(f) No person, firm or corporation shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements or other documentary evidence before the commissioner or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner whether such subpoena be signed or issued by him or his delegate or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged violation of this chapter or of any amendments thereto on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him or it may tend to incriminate him or it or subject him or it to a penalty for forfeiture, but no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty for forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise; except, that any person so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.\n\n(Acts 1969, No. 1049, p. 1939, §29.)",
