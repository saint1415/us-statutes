Such agreement may contain such provisions relating to coverage, benefits, contributions, effective date, modification and termination of the agreement, administration and other appropriate provisions as the State Agency and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare shall agree upon, but, except as may be otherwise required by or under the Social Security Act as to the services to be covered, such agreement shall provide in effect that:(1) Benefits will be provided for employees whose services are covered by the agreement and their dependents and survivors on the same basis as though such services constituted employment within the meaning of Title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.];(2) The State will pay to the Secretary of the Treasury, at such time or times as may be prescribed under the Social Security Act, contributions with respect to wages, as defined in § 5701 of this title, equal to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act if the services covered by the agreement constituted employment within the meaning of such Act;(3) Such agreement shall be effective with respect to services in employment covered by the agreement performed after a date specified therein but in no event may it be effective with respect to any such services performed prior to the first day of the calendar year in which such agreement is entered into or in which the modification of the agreement making it applicable to such services is entered into, except that with respect to an agreement or modification thereof entered into prior to January 1, 1954, the agreement or modification thereof may be effective with respect to such services performed on or after January 1, 1951, except that a modification entered into after December 31, 1954, and prior to January 1, 1958, may be effective with respect to services performed after December 31, 1954, or after a later date specified in such modification;(4) All services which constitute employment and are performed in the employ of the State by employees of the State shall be covered by the agreement; provided, however, that services which may be excluded under the Social Security Act may be excluded by the agreement and provided further that the agreement may be drawn to exclude all employees of the State without prejudice to the right to cover employees of the State in a subsequent modification of the agreement;(5) All services which (i) constitute employment as defined in § 5701 of this title, (ii) are performed in the employ of a political subdivision of the State and (iii) are covered by a plan which is in conformity with the terms of the agreement and has been approved by the State Agency under § 5706 of this title shall be covered by the agreement; provided, however, that services which may be excluded under the Social Security Act may be excluded by the agreement;(6) As modified, the agreement shall include all services described in either paragraph (4) or (5) of this section and performed by individuals to whom § 218(c)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 418] is applicable and shall provide that the service of any such individual shall continue to be covered by the agreement in case the individual thereafter becomes eligible to be a member of a retirement system; and(7) As modified, the agreement shall include all services described in either paragraph (4) or (5) of this section and performed by individuals in positions covered by a retirement system with respect to which the Governor has issued a certificate to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare pursuant to § 5710(b) of this title.48 Del.

Such liability shall arise in consideration of the employee’s retention in the service of the State or the employee’s entry upon such service after June 8, 1951.(b) The contribution imposed by this section shall be collected by deducting the amount of the contribution from wages as and when paid, but failure to make such deduction shall not relieve the employee from liability for such contribution.(c) If more or less than the correct amount of the contribution imposed by this section is paid or deducted with respect to any remuneration, proper adjustments or refund, if adjustment is impracticable, shall be made, without interest, in such manner and at such times as the State Agency shall prescribe.48 Del.

Plans for coverage of employees of political subdivisions.(a) Each political subdivision of the State may submit for approval by the State Agency a plan for extending the benefits of Title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.], in conformity with applicable provisions of such Act, to employees of such political subdivisions. Each such plan and any amendment thereof shall be approved by the State Agency if it finds that such plan, or such plan as amended, is in conformity with such requirements as are provided in regulations of the State Agency, except that no such plan shall be approved unless:(1) It is in conformity with the requirements of the Social Security Act and with the agreement entered into under § 5703 of this title;(2) It provides that all services which constitute employment and are performed in the employ of the political subdivision by employees thereof shall be covered by the plan except that it may exclude services performed by individuals to whom § 218(c)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 418] is applicable; provided, however, that services which may be excluded under the Social Security Act may be excluded by the agreement;(3) It specifies the source or sources from which the funds necessary to make the payments required by paragraph (c)(1) this section and by subsection (d) of this section are expected to be derived and contains reasonable assurance that such sources will be adequate for such purpose;(4) It provides for such methods of administration of the plan by the political subdivision as are found by the State Agency to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the plan;(5) It provides that the political subdivision will make such reports, in such form and containing such information as the State Agency may from time to time require, and comply with such provisions as the State Agency or the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports; and(6) It authorizes the State Agency to terminate the plan in its entirety, in the discretion of the State Agency, if it finds that there has been a failure to comply substantially with any provision contained in such plan, such termination to take effect at the expiration of such notice and on such conditions as may be provided by regulations of the State Agency and may be consistent with the Social Security Act.(b) The State Agency shall not finally refuse to approve a plan submitted by a political subdivision under subsection (a) of this section and shall not terminate an approved plan without reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the political subdivision affected thereby.(c) (1) Each political subdivision as to which a plan has been approved under this section shall pay into the Contribution Fund with respect to wages, at such time or times as the State Agency may by regulation prescribe, contributions in the amounts and at the rates specified in the applicable agreement entered into by the State Agency under § 5703 of this title.(2) Each political subdivision required to make payments under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, in consideration of the employee’s retention in or entry upon employment after June 8, 1951, impose upon each of its employees, as to services which are covered by an approved plan, a contribution with respect to wages not exceeding the amount of the employee tax which would be imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act if such services constituted employment within the meaning of such Act and may deduct the amount of such contribution from wages as and when paid. Contributions so collected shall be paid into the Contribution Fund in partial discharge of the liability of such political subdivision or instrumentality under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Failure to deduct such contribution shall not relieve the employee or employer of liability therefor.(d) Delinquent payments due under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, with interest at the rate currently then being charged by the Social Security Administration but not less than $10 per each delinquency, be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the political subdivision liable therefor or may, at the request of the State Agency, be deducted from any other moneys payable to such subdivision by any department or agency of the State.48 Del.
