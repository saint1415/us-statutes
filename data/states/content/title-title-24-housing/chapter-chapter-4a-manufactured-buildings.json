      "text": "Section 24-4A-1\n\nLegislative Findings; Purpose of Chapter.\n\nThe Legislature hereby finds that in an effort to meet the housing needs within the state, the private housing and construction industry has developed mass production techniques which can substantially reduce a housing and building cost, and that the mass production of housing and buildings consisting primarily of factory manufacture presents unique problems with respect to the establishment of uniform health and safety standards and inspection procedures. The Legislature further finds that by minimizing the problems of standards and inspection procedures, it is demonstrating its intention to encourage the reduction of manufactured building construction costs, and to make housing and home ownership more feasible for all residents of the state.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-706, p. 1183, §1.)",
