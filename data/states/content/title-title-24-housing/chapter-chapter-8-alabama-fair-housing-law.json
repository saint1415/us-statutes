This chapter shall not prohibit a private club not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose provides lodgings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of the lodgings to its members or from giving preference to its members.\n\n(f) This chapter shall not prohibit conduct against a person because the person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined by law.\n\n(g) For purposes of subdivision (6) of Section 24-8-4, the term “discrimination” includes any of the following conduct:\n\n(1) A refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by the person if the modifications are necessary to afford that person full enjoyment of the premises, except that in the case of a rental, the landlord, where it is reasonable to do so, may condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted.\n\n(2) A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when accommodations may be necessary to afford the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\n\n(3) In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after the date that is 30 months after the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that:\n\na. The public use and common use portions of the dwelling are readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;\n\nb. The dwelling has at least one building entrance on an accessible route unless it is impracticable to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site;\n\nc. All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within the dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by handicapped persons in wheelchairs; and\n\nd. All premises within these dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design:\n\n1. An accessible route into and through the dwelling;\n\n2. Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations;\n\n3. Reinforcements in the bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and\n\n4. Usable kitchens and bathrooms that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space.\n\n(h) Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for Buildings and Facilities Providing Accessibility and Usability for Physically Handicapped People (commonly cited as “ANSI A117.1″) suffices to satisfy the requirements of subsection (g)(3)d.\n\n(1) If a unit of local government has incorporated into its laws the requirements in subsection (g)(3), compliance with these laws is considered to satisfy the requirements.\n\n(2) A unit of local government may review and approve newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings for the purpose of making determinations as to whether the design and construction requirements of subsection (g)(3) are met.\n\n(3) The office shall encourage, but may not require, units of local government to include in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as to whether the design and construction of these dwellings are consistent with subsection (g)(3), and shall provide technical assistance to units of local government and other persons to implement the requirements of subsection (g)(3).\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the office to review or approve the plans, designs, or construction of all covered multifamily dwellings, to determine whether the design and construction of these dwellings are consistent with the requirements of subsection (g)(3).\n\n(i)(1) Nothing in subsection (h) shall be construed to affect the authority and responsibility of the Attorney General to receive and process complaints or otherwise engage in enforcement activities under this chapter.\n\n(2) Determinations by the unit of local government under subsection (h) are not conclusive in enforcement proceedings under this chapter.\n\n(j) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit any rule, regulation, resolution, or ordinance of a political subdivision of the state that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords handicapped persons greater access than is required by this chapter.\n\n(k) Nothing in this chapter with respect to discrimination based on handicap requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose occupancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose occupancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.\n\n(l) Nothing in this chapter limits the applicability of any reasonable local, state, or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Owners and managers of dwellings may develop and implement reasonable occupancy and safety standards based on factors such as the number and size of sleeping areas or bedrooms and the overall size of a dwelling unit so long as the standards do not violate local, state, or federal restrictions. The provisions in this chapter regarding familial status shall not apply to housing for older persons. This chapter shall not prohibit the lease application or similar document from requiring information concerning the number, age, sex, and familial relationship of the applicants and the dwellings’ intended occupants. The owner or manager may consider these factors in determining payment of utilities. The application also may require disclosure by the applicant of the conviction of any intended occupant for violating any laws pertaining to the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined in Title 22.\n\n(m) Section 24-8-4 with respect to discrimination based on sex does not apply to the rental or leasing of dwellings in a single-sex dormitory property.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-659, p. 1248, §7; Acts 1995, No. 95-676, p. 1472, §1; Acts 1996, No. 96-261, p. 307, §1.)",

The office may issue subpoenas to compel its access to or the production of the materials or the appearance of the persons and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in court. The office may administer oaths. Any examination, recording, copying of materials, and the taking and recording of testimony or statements of persons as reasonably are necessary for the furtherance of the investigation must be solely related to the complaint for which the subpoena was issued.\n\n(b) Upon written application to the office, a respondent is entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the office to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the office itself. A subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall show on its face the name and address of the respondent and shall state that it was issued at his request.\n\n(c) Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the person may petition the office to revoke or modify the subpoena. The office shall grant the petition if it finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, or that compliance would be unduly onerous or for other good reason.\n\n(d) In case of refusal to obey a subpoena, the office or the person at whose request the subpoena was issued may petition for its enforcement in the circuit court for the county in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n\n(e) Witnesses summoned by a subpoena under this chapter are entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as witnesses in proceedings in court. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a party must be paid by that party or, where a party is unable to pay the fees, by the office.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-659, p. 1248, §11.)",

Complaints shall be in writing and shall contain information and be in a form required by the office. Upon receipt of a complaint, the office shall serve notice upon the aggrieved person of the time limits and choices of forums provided under this chapter and shall furnish a copy of the complaint to the person who allegedly committed the discriminatory housing practice or is about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice and serve notice of the procedural rights and obligations under the law. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c), the office shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether it intends to resolve it. If the office decides to resolve the complaint, it shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. If practicable, conciliation meetings must be held in the cities or other localities where the discriminatory housing practices allegedly occurred. Nothing said or done in the course of the informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the written consent of the persons concerned. An employee of the office who makes public any information in violation of this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200), or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.\n\n(b) A complaint under subsection (a) must be filed within 180 days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. The complaint must be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. A complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him or her, not later than 10 days after receipt of notice, and may be amended reasonably and fairly by the respondent at any time. Both complaint and answer must be verified.\n\n(c) Wherever a local fair housing law has been certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as substantially equivalent, the office shall notify the appropriate local agency of any complaint filed under this chapter which appears to constitute a violation of the local fair housing law, and the office shall take no further action with respect to the complaint if the local law enforcement official, within 30 days from the date the alleged offense was brought to his or her attention, has commenced proceedings in the matter. In no event may the office take further action unless it certifies that in its judgment, under the circumstances of the particular case, the protection of the rights of the parties or the interest of justice require the action. Complaints referred to the office by the Department of Housing and Urban Development may not be referred by the office to a local agency.\n\n(d) Any conciliation agreement arising out of conciliation efforts by the office must be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant and is subject to the approval of the office.

      "text": "Section 24-8-13\n\nRecommendation for Hearing by Investigator; Order for Hearing; Parties’ Right to Take Civil Action; Amendment of Complaint; Subpoenas; Refusal to Allow Discovery; Hearing; Panel Opinion and Order; Review.\n\n(a) If not sooner resolved, the investigator, upon completion of his investigation, shall submit to ADECA a statement of the facts disclosed by his investigation and recommend either that the complaint be dismissed or that a panel of office members be designated to hear the complaint. ADECA, after review of the case file and the statement and recommendation of the investigator, shall issue an order either of dismissal or for a hearing, which is not subject to judicial or other further review.\n\n(b) If the order is for dismissal, ADECA shall mail a copy of the order to the complainant and the respondent at their last known addresses. The complainant may bring an action against the respondent in circuit court within 90 days of the date of the dismissal or within one year from the date of the violation alleged, whichever occurs later, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this chapter and to seek relief as provided for in Section 24-8-14.\n\n(c)(1) If the order is for a hearing, ADECA shall attach to it a notice and a copy of the complaint and require the respondent to answer the complaint at a hearing at a time and place specified in the notice and shall serve upon the respondent a copy of the order, the complaint, and the notice.\n\n(2) Either party may elect to have the claims asserted in the complaint decided in a civil action. ADECA notice must be sent to all parties and inform them of their right to take civil action. An election must be made within 20 days after receipt of the notice. A party making this election shall notify ADECA and all other parties. If an election is made for a civil action, ADECA shall, within 30 days from the date of election, commence and maintain a civil action pursuant to Section 24-8-14 on behalf of the aggrieved person.\n\n(d) At any time before a hearing, a complaint may be amended by ADECA upon the request of the investigator or of the complainant or of the respondent. Complaints may be amended during a hearing only upon a majority vote of the panel of office members for the hearing.\n\n(e) Upon request by any party, ADECA shall issue appropriate subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum to any witnesses or other custodians of documents desired to be present at the hearing, or at prehearing depositions, unless ADECA determines that issuance of the subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum would be unreasonably or unduly burdensome.\n\n(f) Upon notification by any party that any party or witness has failed to permit access, failed to comply with a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum, refused to have his deposition taken, refused to answer interrogatories, or otherwise refused to allow discovery, the office, upon notice to the party or witness, shall apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring discovery and other good faith compliance unless the office determines that the discovery would be unreasonably or unduly burdensome.\n\n(g) ADECA shall designate a panel of three persons to hear the complaint.\n\n(h) At any hearing held pursuant to this section, the case in support of the complaint must be presented before the panel by one or more of the offices’ employees or agents or by legal representatives of the complaining party. Endeavors at conciliation by the investigator may not be received into evidence nor otherwise made known to the members of the panel.\n\n(i) The respondent shall submit a written answer to the complaint and appear at the hearing in person or by counsel and may submit evidence. The respondent may amend his answer reasonably and fairly.\n\n(j) The complainant must be permitted to be present and submit evidence.\n\n(k) Proceedings under this section are subject to the provisions of the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, and in the case of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, the provisions of the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act shall govern. A recording of the proceedings must be made, which may be transcribed subsequently upon request and payment of a reasonable fee by the complainant or the respondent. The fee must be set by the office or upon motion of the panel, in which case copies of the transcription must be made available to the complainant or the respondent upon request and payment of a reasonable fee to be set by the office.\n\n(l) If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the panel shall find that the respondent has engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice, it shall state its findings of fact and serve upon the complainant and the respondent in the name of the office an opinion and order for appropriate relief which may include that the unlawful discriminatory practice be discontinued, actual damages, civil penalties which may not be greater than civil penalties established by the Federal Fair Housing Act in Section 812 and reasonable attorney’s fees. The office may retain jurisdiction of the case until it is satisfied of compliance by the respondent of its order.\n\n(m) If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the panel finds that the respondent has not engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice, the panel shall state its findings of fact and serve upon the complainant and the respondent an opinion and order dismissing the complaint as to the respondent. A prevailing respondent may apply to the office for an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n(n) A copy of the opinion and order of the office shall be delivered in all cases to such other public officers as the office considers proper. Copies of the opinion and order must be available to the public for inspection upon request, and copies must be made available to any person upon payment of a reasonable fee set by the office.\n\n(o)(1) If an application for review is made to the office within 14 days from the date the order of the office has been given, the office, for good cause shown, shall review the order and evidence, receive further evidence, rehear the parties or their representatives, and if proper, amend the order.\n\n(2) Either party to the dispute, within 30 days after receipt of notice to be sent by registered mail of the order, but not after that time, may appeal from the decision of the office to the circuit court of the county in which the hearing occurred, or in which the respondent resides or has his principal office. In case of an appeal from the decision of the office, the appeal shall operate as a supersedeas for 30 days only, unless otherwise ordered by the court, and after that the respondent is required to comply with the order involved in the appeal or certification until the questions at issue in it have been determined fully in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(3) The office may institute a proceeding for enforcement of its order of subsection (l), or its amended order of subdivision (1) after 30 days from the day of the order, by filing a petition in the circuit court of the county in which the hearing occurred, or where any person against whom the order is entered resides or transacts business.\n\n(4) If no appeal under subdivision (2) is initiated, the office may obtain a decree of the court for enforcement of its order upon a showing that a copy of the petition for enforcement was served upon the party subject to the dictates of the office’s order.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-659, p. 1248, §13.)",

However, the court shall continue a civil case brought pursuant to this section, from time to time, before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the office or local agency are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the office or to the local agency and which practice forms the basis for the action in court. Any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated before the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this chapter and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrances, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter are not affected. A civil action may be commenced by an aggrieved person whether or not a complaint has been filed with the office.\n\n(b) The court may grant as relief, as it considers appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order and may award the plaintiff actual damages, and punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees in the case of a prevailing party, if the prevailing party in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume the attorney’s fees.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-659, p. 1248, §14.)",
