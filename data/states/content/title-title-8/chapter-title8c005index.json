Annual franchise tax report; contents; failure to file and pay tax; duties of Secretary of State.(a) Annually on or before March 1, every corporation now existing or hereafter incorporated under Chapter 1 of this title or which has accepted the Constitution of this State, shall make an annual franchise tax report to the Secretary of State. The report shall be made on a form designated by the Secretary of State and shall be signed by the corporation’s president, secretary, treasurer or other proper officer duly authorized so to act, or by any of its directors, or if filing an initial report by any incorporator in the event its board of directors shall not have been elected. The fact that an individual’s name is signed on the report shall be prima facie evidence that such individual is authorized to certify the report on behalf of the corporation; however, the official title or position of the individual signing the corporate report shall be designated. The report shall contain the following information:(1) The location of its registered office in this State, which shall include the street, number, city and postal code;(2) The name of the agent upon whom service of process against the corporation may be served;(3) The nature of the business of the corporation;(4) The location of the principal place of business of the corporation, which shall include the street, number, city, state or foreign country (provided that, unless a corporation maintains its principal place of business in this State and serves as its own registered agent, for purposes of this subsection, the principal place of business address shall not be the address of the registered office of the corporation in this State and shall not be the address of any other registered agent);(5) The names and addresses of all the directors as of the filing date of the report and the name and address of the officer who signs the report; provided, that other than an initial report, all reports shall list a director or directors excepting any report filed in conjunction with a certificate of dissolution filed by an incorporator pursuant to §  274 of this title or a certificate of dissolution filed pursuant to §  275(c) of this title;(6) The number of shares and the par value per share of each class of capital stock having a par value and the number of shares of each class of stock without par value which the corporation is authorized to issue; and(7) Such additional information, schedules and attachments as the Secretary shall require to ascertain the franchise tax due to the State.(b) If any officer or director of a corporation required to make an annual franchise tax report to the Secretary of State shall knowingly make any false statement in the report, such officer or director shall be guilty of perjury.(c) If the annual franchise tax report and the franchise tax due are not filed or paid by the corporation as required by this chapter, the Secretary of State shall ascertain and fix the amount of the franchise tax as determined in the manner prescribed by § 503(a) of this title and the amount so fixed by the Secretary of State shall stand as the basis of taxation under the provisions of this chapter unless the corporation shall thereafter elect to compute the franchise tax in the manner prescribed by § 503(a)(2) of this title by filing the annual franchise tax report and complying with the provisions of § 503(b) of this title. In the event of neglect, refusal or failure on the part of any corporation to file a complete annual franchise tax report with the Secretary of State on or before March 1, the corporation shall pay the sum of $200 to be recovered by adding that amount to the franchise tax as herein determined and fixed, and such additional sum shall become a part of the franchise tax as so determined and fixed, and shall be collected in the same manner and subject to the same penalties.(d) In case any corporation shall fail to file its annual franchise tax report and the franchise tax due within the time required by this chapter, and in case the agent in charge of the registered office of any corporation upon whom process against the corporation may be served shall die, resign, refuse to act as such, remove from this State or cannot with due diligence be found, it shall be lawful while default continues to serve process against the corporation upon the Secretary of State. Such service upon the Secretary of State shall be made in the manner and shall have the effect stated in § 321(b) of this title and shall be governed in all respects by said subsection.(e) The Secretary of State shall safely keep all reports returned in such manner as they may be open to the inspection of all persons pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 100 of Title 29. Any tax information provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section, contained on annual franchise tax reports filed after tax year 2006 shall not be deemed public.(f) The Secretary of State shall not issue certificates of good standing that pertain to any corporation that has an unpaid franchise tax balance due to the State or does not have on file a completed annual franchise tax report for the relevant time period.21 Del.

Rates and computation of franchise tax.(a) All corporations accepting the provisions of the Constitution of this State and coming under Chapter 1 of this title, and all corporations which have heretofore filed or may hereafter file a certificate of incorporation under said chapter, shall pay to the Secretary of State as an annual franchise tax whichever of the applicable amounts prescribed by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section is the lesser:(1) Where a corporation that is not authorized to issue capital stock is not an exempt corporation under § 501(b) of this title, $175; where the authorized capital stock does not exceed 5,000 shares, $175; where the authorized capital stock exceeds 5,000 shares, but is not more than 10,000 shares, $250; and the further sum of $85 on each 10,000 shares or part thereof.(2) One hundred and seventy-five dollars where the assumed no-par capital of the corporation, found in the manner provided in this paragraph, does not exceed $500,000; $250 where the assumed no-par capital exceeds $500,000 but is not more than $1,000,000; and the further sum of $85 for each $1,000,000 or part thereof of such additional assumed no-par capital.For the purpose of computing the tax in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the corporation’s assumed no-par capital, whenever the phrase “assumed no-par capital” is used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall be found by multiplying the number of authorized shares of capital stock without par value by $100.To the amount of tax attributable to the corporation’s assumed no-par capital, computed as above prescribed, add $400 for each $1,000,000 or fraction thereof in excess of $1,000,000 of an assumed par value capital, found by multiplying the number of authorized shares of capital stock having par value by the quotient resulting from dividing the amount of the total assets of the corporation, as shown in the manner hereinafter provided, by the total number of issued shares of all denominations and classes. If the quotient shall be less than the par value of any denomination or class of authorized shares having par value, the number of the shares of each class shall be multiplied by their par value for the purpose of ascertaining the assumed par value capital in respect of the shares and the number of authorized shares having a par value to be multiplied by the quotient, as aforesaid, shall be reduced by the number of the shares whose par value exceeds the quotient; and where, to determine the assumed par value capital, it is necessary to multiply a class or classes of shares by the quotient and also to multiply a class or classes of shares by the par value of the shares, the assumed par value capital of the corporation shall be the sum of the products of the multiplications. Whenever the amount of the assumed par value capital, computed as above prescribed, is less than $1,000,000, the amount of the tax attributable thereto shall be the amount that bears the same relation to $400 that the amount of the assumed par value capital bears to $1,000,000.(b) Unless a corporation shall submit to the Secretary of State, at the time of filing its annual franchise tax report, a statement setting forth the number of shares of each class of stock actually issued, if any, and the amount of the total gross assets of the corporation, as of the nearest date on which the amount is obtainable, including in the statement its goodwill valued at the same amount at which it is valued in the books of account of the corporation, it shall pay a franchise tax for such year computed in the manner prescribed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.(c) Except as provided in this subsection, in no case shall the tax on any corporation for a full taxable year, computed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section be more than $200,000 nor less than $175; or computed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section be more than $200,000 nor less than $400. As of December 1 of each calendar year, the Secretary of State shall compile a list of each corporation that, as of such date, met the criteria of a large corporate filer as follows:(1) Had a class or series of stock listed on a national securities exchange; and(2) Reported in its financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and included in its most recent annual report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar agency outside the United States with responsibility for enforcing securities laws or serving as a public repository for the corporation’s financial disclosures, both of the following:a. Consolidated annual gross revenues equal to or greater than $750,000,000 or consolidated assets equal to or greater than $750,000,000; andb. Consolidated annual gross revenues not less than $250,000,000 and consolidated assets not less than $250,000,000;provided that if the corporation’s financial statements are reported in a currency other than United States dollars, then, for purposes of measuring the amount of revenues and assets set forth therein, such amounts shall be converted into United States dollars using the applicable spot exchange rate for value established by Bloomberg as of the last day of the corporation’s most recently completed fiscal year.(3) As used in this subsection:a. “Predecessor” means, with respect to any corporation, any other corporation or other entity whose consolidated assets and liabilities, immediately prior to a succession, are substantially the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of such corporation immediately following such succession; andb. “Succession” means the direct acquisition of assets and liabilities comprising a going business from a predecessor, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or other direct transfer.(4) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and the first sentence of this subsection, for each corporation satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for a fiscal year for which its annual franchise tax would otherwise be $200,000 as computed under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section (each, a “large corporate filer”), the Secretary of State shall fix the annual franchise tax for such taxable year at $250,000. If a corporation would otherwise qualify as a large corporate filer but has no filed annual report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (or any similar foreign agency), and became listed on a national securities exchange in connection with a succession within the taxable year, then reference must be made to the most recent annual report of the predecessor of such corporation for purposes of determining whether such corporation has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)a. and (c)(2)b. of this section.Once a corporation is designated by the Secretary of State as a large corporate filer, it will be considered a large corporate filer until it submits evidence to the Secretary of State for any year in which the corporation does not meet the criteria in this subsection. Any such redesignation shall be effective as of the date the evidence of redesignation is received by the Secretary of State and will not retroactively modify the large corporate filer status of any corporation. Except as otherwise authorized by law, no large corporate filer shall be granted a refund of taxes paid due to its failure to comply with the requirements of this section.(d) In case the corporation has not been in existence during the whole year, the amount of tax due, at the foregoing rates and as above provided, shall be prorated for the portion of the year during which the corporation was in existence.(e) In case a corporation shall have changed during the taxable year the amount of its authorized capital stock, the total annual franchise tax payable at the foregoing rates shall be arrived at by adding together the franchise taxes calculated as above set forth as prorated for the several periods of the year during which each distinct authorized amount of capital stock was in effect. The filing of a certificate of validation under § 204 of this title shall not reduce the annual franchise tax and interest due for any period prior to the filing of such certificate of validation, and shall not entitle the corporation to a refund, and any calculation of additional annual franchise tax and interest due for any period prior to the filing of such certificate of validation shall be calculated at the current rates in effect under this section.(f) Every corporation which shall show on its annual franchise tax report that it has not been engaged in any of the business activities for which it was granted a certificate of incorporation, shall pay only at the rate of one half of the amount of taxes scheduled above for the portion of the year as it shall not have been so engaged and at the full rate for the remainder of the year. The Secretary of State may require the filling of a supplemental affidavit stating fully the pertinent facts upon which the claim for one-half rate is based.(g) For the purpose of computing the taxes imposed by this section, the authorized capital stock of a corporation shall be considered to be the total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue, whether or not the number of shares that may be outstanding at any one time be limited to a less number.(h) [Repealed.](i) As used in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the term “total assets” and the term “total gross assets” are identical terms and mean all assets of the corporation, net only of allowances for bad debts, accumulated depreciation, accumulated depletion, accumulated amortization of land and accumulated amortization of intangible assets.Such total assets and total gross assets shall be those “total assets” reported to the United States on U.S. Form 1120 Schedule L, relative to the company’s fiscal year ending in the calendar year prior to filing with the Secretary of State pursuant to this section. If such schedule is no longer in use, the Secretary of State shall designate a replacement. The Secretary of State may at any time require a true and correct copy of such schedule to be filed with the Secretary of State’s office. If such schedule or its replacement reports on a consolidated basis, the reporting corporation shall submit to the Secretary of State the consolidating ending balance sheets which accompany such schedule as a reconciliation of its reported total assets or total gross assets to the consolidated total assets reported on the schedule.Interests in entities which are consolidated with the reporting company shall be included within “total assets” and “total gross assets.”21 Del.

Collection and disposition of tax; tentative return and tax; penalty interest; investigation of annual franchise tax report; notice of additional tax due.(a) The franchise tax shall be due and payable on March 1 following the close of the calendar year, except that with respect to a corporation whose franchise tax liability for the current calendar year is estimated to be $5,000 or more, a tentative return and tax shall be due and payable as follows:(1) Forty percent of the estimated tax on June 1 of the current year;(2) Twenty percent of the estimated tax on September 1 of the current year;(3) Twenty percent of the estimated tax on December 1 of the current year; and(4) The remainder of the tax as finally determined together with the annual franchise tax report on March 1 following the close of the calendar year.(b) The Department of State shall receive the franchise tax and pay over all taxes collected to the Department of Finance, except as provided in § 506 of this title.(c) If the tax of any corporation remains unpaid after the due dates established by this section, the tax shall bear interest at the rate of 11/2percent for each month or portion thereof until fully paid.(d) The Secretary of State has power to inquire into the truth or falsity or accuracy of every report required to be filed to carry out this chapter. The Secretary of State may require the production of the books of any corporation referred to in this chapter and may swear or affirm and examine witnesses in relation thereto. Where the Secretary of State shall determine the amount of franchise tax which has been paid is less than the franchise tax due, the Secretary of State shall notify the taxpayer of the additional tax and any interest thereon which is due. Such additional tax and interest thereon shall be paid, or a petition for review thereof shall be filed, within 60 days after the notification to the taxpayer.(e) The tentative return and tax paid thereon under subsection (a) of this section shall be based on the annual franchise tax of the preceding year.(f) The penalties for nonpayment of the tentative franchise tax as set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be the same as those applied for any nonpayment of franchise tax in this title.(g) The Secretary of State may in the Secretary of State’s discretion charge a fee of $60 for each check received for payment of franchise taxes, penalties or interest thereon that is returned due to insufficient funds or as the result of a stop payment order to be recovered by adding the amount of that fee to the franchise tax, and such sum shall become a part of the franchise tax and shall be collected in the same manner and subject to the same penalties.21 Del.

No refund shall be granted in connection with the filing of a certificate of correction under § 103(f) of this title or the filing of a certificate of validation under § 204 of this title.(b) Prior to the filing of a certificate required by § 312(c) of this title, a corporation may petition the Secretary of State for a reduction of taxes, penalties or interest which the State claims are due it pursuant to § 312(g) of this title and which the corporation claims have been erroneously or illegally fixed.(c) If the Secretary of State determines the tax, interest and/or penalties fixed by the Secretary or taxes paid are excessive or incorrect, in whole or in part, the Secretary shall resettle the same and adjust the assessment of tax, interest or penalties accordingly and shall refund to the corporation any amount paid in excess of the proper amount of tax, interest and/or penalties so determined to be due. In the case of any corporation which is not required to pay an annual tax under § 501(a) of this title, the Secretary of State may remit all or part of the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

Thereupon a fieri facias or other process shall issue for the collection of the same as other debts are collected. If no property which may be seized and sold on fieri facias shall be found within this State sufficient to pay the decree, the Court shall further order and decree that the corporation, within 10 days from and after the service of notice of the decree upon any officer of the corporation upon whom service of process may be lawfully made, or such notice as the Court shall direct, shall assign and transfer to the trustee or receiver appointed by the Court, any chose in action, or any patent or patents, or any assignments of or license under any patented invention or inventions owned by, leased or licensed to or controlled in whole or in part by the corporation, to be sold by the receiver or trustee for the satisfaction of the decree. No injunction theretofore issued nor any forfeiture of the charter of any corporation shall be held to exempt the corporation from compliance with the order of the Court.(c) If the corporation neglects or refuses within 10 days from and after the service of the notice of the decree to assign and transfer the same to the receiver or trustee for sale as aforesaid, the Court shall appoint a trustee to make the assignment of the same, in the name and on behalf of the corporation, to the receiver or trustee appointed to make the sale. The receiver or trustee shall thereupon, after such notice and in such manner as required for the sale under fieri facias of personal property, sell the same to the highest bidder. The receiver or trustee, upon the payment of the purchase money, shall execute and deliver to the purchaser an assignment and transfer of all the patents and interests of the corporation so sold, which assignment or transfer shall vest in the purchaser a valid title to all right, title and interest whatsoever of the corporation therein, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to the payment of the unpaid taxes, together with the costs of the proceedings.21 Del.
