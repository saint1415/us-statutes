Every such trust company and savings bank, which shall be\ndissolved, and shall not become merged or consolidated with another\ncorporation taxable under this subpart, shall, if dissolution takes\nplace between the thirtieth day of June and the succeeding first day of\nJanuary, be subject to a tax, for that part of such period in which it\nhad been doing business, computed in the same manner and at the same\nrate as the minimum tax under subdivision two of this section, except\nthat the income forming the basis for proration shall be the income for\nthe calendar year in which such dissolution occurs; and the issued\ncapital stock, or interest credited to depositors of a savings bank,\nshall be taken as of the date of dissolution; provided, however, that\nthe tax so computed shall be reduced one-half and an additional\none-twelfth for each month, or major portion thereof, between the date\nof dissolution and the succeeding first day of January. If dissolution\noccurs between the thirty-first day of December and the succeeding\nsixteenth day of March, such trust company and savings bank shall be\nsubject to the same tax that would have been due from it on or before\nthe fifteenth day of March had it not been dissolved, except that such\ntax shall be reduced one-twelfth for each month, or major portion\nthereof, from the date of dissolution to the succeeding first day of\nJuly, and shall be for the period beginning on the preceding first day\nof July and ending on the date of dissolution. In no event shall the tax\nunder this subdivision be less than ten dollars or, as an alternative,\nfor the year nineteen hundred seventy-one and those following, not less\nthan twelve and one-half dollars.7. In the case of a consolidation or merger of taxpayers, or in case a\nnational bank taxable under subpart two of this part shall be\nconsolidated or merged with a taxpayer under this subpart, or in case of\na series of such transactions, there shall be added to the net income of\nthe taxpayer resulting from such consolidations or mergers the net\nincome of the taxpayers which are consolidated or merged for the period\nfor which the taxpayer resulting from such consolidation or merger is\nrequired to render any return under this subpart, except that net income\nshall not be included if it has already been used as the basis for a tax\nunder this subpart, and the tax payable on the filing of such return\nshall be based upon the entire net income reported therein. The\nacquisition by a taxpayer, directly or indirectly, of the assets or\nfranchises of another taxpayer or national bank shall be deemed a merger\nfor the purposes of this section.8. The tax imposed by this subpart shall be for the calendar year next\npreceding the year in which it becomes due; except that with respect to\ncorporations subject to a tax imposed under subdivisions three, four,\nfive or six of this section, the tax shall be for the period therein\nspecified, and except that with respect to corporations required to file\na declaration of estimated tax and to make payments on account of such\nestimated tax as provided by section thirty-five of this part, all\npayments of tax within a calendar year, whether computed on the basis of\nnet income for the current calendar year or on the basis of net income\nfor the preceding calendar year, shall be for the calendar year in which\nthe payments are required to be made.9. In the event that it shall be finally determined by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction that the taxes imposed on national banking\nassociations by subpart two of this part are unconstitutional or invalid\nfor the reason that they are not in conformity with the provisions of\nsection fifty-two hundred nineteen of the United States revised\nstatutes, then, in lieu of the taxes imposed by the provisions of this\nsubpart, every corporation that otherwise would have been subject to tax\nunder this subpart shall be subject to the tax imposed under part two as\nof the effective date of part two, and all of the provisions of part\ntwo, unless clearly inappropriate, shall be applicable except\nsubdivision four of section three; and, in such event, any payments\nmade, reports or returns filed or any act of the director of finance or\nof a taxpayer purportedly under this part shall be treated as though\nmade, filed or done pursuant to part two.10. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions one and two, for\nthe years nineteen hundred seventy-three and those following, such city\nmay impose, by local law, a surtax of fifteen per centum of the\npercentage of tax in effect for the year nineteen hundred seventy-two.§ 13. Years for which imposed. The tax imposed by section twelve of\nthis part is imposed for each calendar year beginning with the calendar\nyear nineteen hundred sixty-six.§ 14. Ascertainment of gain or loss. 1. For the purpose of\nascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other\ndisposition of property, real, personal or mixed, the basis shall be the\ncost thereof, or the inventoried value if the inventory is made in\naccordance with section seventeen of this part.2. Notwithstanding subdivision one of this section, with respect to\ngain derived from the sale or other disposition of any property acquired\nprior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, except stock in\ntrade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly\nbe included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of\nthe taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to\ncustomers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, and accounts\nor notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of trade or business\nfrom the sale of such stock in trade or property, or for services\nrendered, net income shall not include(a) That portion of the gain included in determining net income\npursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect to each such\nproperty, which exceeds(b) The amount of gain that would be included in determining net\nincome pursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect to each\nsuch property if the basis of such property on the date of sale or other\ndisposition were equal to its fair market value on January first,\nnineteen hundred sixty-six, plus or minus all adjustments to basis made\nwith respect to each such property in computing net income for periods\non or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six;\nprovided that the total adjustment to net income provided by this\nsubdivision shall not exceed the amount of the taxpayer's net gain from\nthe sale or other disposition of all such property, as determined\npursuant to subdivision one of this section.3. In the case of any bond, with respect to which a deduction for\namortizable bond premium is allowable under subdivision nine of section\ntwenty-one of this part, the basis for determining gain or loss shall be\nreduced by the total amount of such deductions so allowable.§ 15. Exchange of property.--Upon the sale or exchange of property the\nentire amount of the gain or loss, determined under section fourteen,\nshall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section:1. No gain or loss shall be recognized if common stock in a\ncorporation is exchanged solely for common stock in the same\ncorporation, or if preferred stock in a corporation is exchanged solely\nfor preferred stock in the same corporation;2. No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a\ncorporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of\nreorganization, exchanged solely for stock or securities in such\ncorporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization;3. No gain or loss shall be recognized if a taxpayer, a party to a\nreorganization, exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of\nreorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a\nparty to the reorganization; and4. No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a\ncorporation by a taxpayer solely in exchange for stock or securities in\nsuch corporation, and immediately after the exchange such taxpayer is in\ncontrol of the corporation; but in the case of an exchange by a taxpayer\nand one or more other corporations or persons this subdivision shall\napply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is\nsubstantially in proportion to its interest in the property prior to the\nexchange.5. If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part,\ntheft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or\ncondemnation, or the threat of imminence thereof) is compulsorily or\ninvoluntarily converted into property similar or related in service or\nuse to the property so converted, or into money which is forthwith in\ngood faith, under regulations prescribed by the director of finance,\nexpended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in\nservice or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of\ncontrol of a corporation owning such other property, or in the\nestablishment of a replacement fund, no gain or loss shall be\nrecognized. If any part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if\nany, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the money\nwhich is not so expended.6. If there is distributed, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization,\nto a taxpayer shareholder in a corporation a party to the\nreorganization, stock or securities in such corporation or in another\ncorporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such\ntaxpayer shareholder of stock or securities in such a corporation, no\ngain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities\nshall be recognized.7. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision one,\ntwo, or four of this section if it were not for the fact that the\nproperty received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by\nsuch subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain, but\nalso of other property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient\nshall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such\nmoney and the fair market value of such other property.8. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision three\nof this section if it were not for the fact that the property received\nin exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such\nsubdivision to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of\nother property or money, then--(a) If the taxpayer receiving such other property or money distributes\nit in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the taxpayer\nshall be recognized from the exchange, but(b) If the taxpayer receiving such other property or money does not\ndistribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if\nany, to the taxpayer shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess\nof the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other\nproperty so received, which is not so distributed.9. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision one,\ntwo, three, or four of this section if it were not for the fact that the\nproperty received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by\nsuch subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain or loss,\nbut also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange\nshall be recognized.10. As used in this section:The term \"reorganization\" means (a) a merger or consolidation\n(including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of\nthe voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares\nof all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially\nall the properties of another corporation), or (b) a transfer by a\ncorporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if\nimmediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or\nboth are in control of the corporation to which the assets are\ntransferred, or (c) a recapitalization, or (d) a mere change in\nidentity, form or place of organization, however effected;The term \"a party to a reorganization\" includes a corporation\nresulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the\ncase of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the\nvoting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of\nall other classes of stock of another corporation; andThe term \"control\" means the ownership of at least eighty per centum\nof the voting stock and at least eighty per centum of the total number\nof shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.11. No gain or loss shall be recognized upon the receipt by a taxpayer\nof property distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation. For\nthe purposes of this paragraph a distribution shall be considered to be\nin complete liquidation only if--(a) the taxpayer receiving such property was, on the date of the\nadoption of the plan of liquidation, and has continued to be at all\ntimes until the receipt of the property, the owner of stock (in such\ncorporation) possessing at least eighty per centum of the total combined\nvoting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and the owner of\nat least eighty per centum of the total number of shares of all other\nclasses of stock (except nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred\nas to dividends), and was at no time on or after the date of the\nadoption of the plan of liquidation and until the receipt of the\nproperty the owner of a greater percentage of any class of stock than\nthe percentage of such class owned at the time of the receipt of the\nproperty; and either(b) the distribution is by such corporation in complete cancellation\nor redemption of all its stock, and the transfer of all the property\noccurs within the base year; in such case the adoption by the\nshareholders of the resolution under which is authorized the\ndistribution of all the assets of the corporation in complete\ncancellation or redemption of all its stock, shall be considered an\nadoption of a plan of liquidation, even though no time for the\ncompletion of the transfer of the property is specified in such\nresolution; or(c) such distribution is one of a series of distributions by such\ncorporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock in\naccordance with a plan of liquidation under which the transfer of all\nthe property under the liquidation is to be completed within three years\nfrom the close of the year during which is made the first of the series\nof distributions under the plan, except that if such transfer is not\ncompleted within such period, or if the taxpayer does not continue\nqualified under paragraph (a) until the completion of such transfer, no\ndistribution under the plan shall be considered a distribution in\ncomplete liquidation.If such transfer of all the property does not occur within the year,\nthe director of finance may require of the taxpayer such bond, or waiver\nof the statute of limitations on assessment and collection, or both, as\nhe may deem necessary to insure, if the transfer of the property is not\ncompleted within such three year period, or if the taxpayer does not\ncontinue qualified under paragraph (a) until the completion of such\ntransfer, the assessment and collection of all taxes then imposed under\nthis subpart for such year or subsequent years, to the extent\nattributable to property so received. A distribution otherwise\nconstituting a distribution in complete liquidation within the meaning\nof this paragraph shall not be considered as not constituting such a\ndistribution merely because it does not constitute a distribution or\nliquidation within the meaning of the corporate law under which the\ndistribution is made; and for the purposes of this paragraph a transfer\nof property of such corporation to the taxpayer shall not be considered\nas not constituting a distribution (or one of a series of distributions)\nin complete cancellation or redemption of all the stock of such\ncorporation, merely because the carrying out of the plan involves (1)\nthe transfer under the plan to the taxpayer by such corporation of\nproperty, not attributable to shares owned by the taxpayer, upon an\nexchange described in subdivision three of this section, and (2) the\ncomplete cancellation or redemption under the plan, as a result of\nexchanges described in subdivision two of this section, of the shares\nnot owned by the taxpayers.§ 16. Exchange of property when no gain or loss is realized. When\nproperty is exchanged for other property and no gain or loss is realized\nunder the provisions of the preceding section, the property received\nshall be treated as taking the place of the property exchanged therefor.\nWhere no gain or loss is realized under the provisions of subdivision\neleven of the preceding section, the basis of the property received\nshall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferror\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of section fourteen of this\npart.§ 17. Inventory. Whenever in the opinion of the director of finance\nthe use of inventories is necessary in order clearly to determine the\nincome of any taxpayer, inventory shall be taken by such taxpayer upon\nsuch basis as the director of finance may prescribe, conforming as\nnearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the banking business\nand most clearly reflecting the income.§ 18. Net income defined. The term \"net income\" means the gross\nincome of a taxpayer less the deductions allowed by this subpart.§ 19. Computation of net income. The net income shall be computed in\naccordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping\nthe books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been\nso employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect the\nincome, the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner\nas in the opinion of the director of finance does clearly reflect the\nincome. In determining net income, war losses, taxation of property\nrecovered, and basis of property shall be treated in substantially the\nsame manner as such losses, recoveries and basis are treated under the\napplicable provisions of section thirteen hundred thirty-one of the\ninternal revenue code.§ 20. Gross income defined. 1. The term \"gross income\" includes gains,\nprofits and income derived from the business, of whatever kind and in\nwhatever form paid, including gains, profits or income from dealings in\nproperty, whether real or personal, or gains, profits or income received\nas compensation for services, as interest, rents, commissions, brokerage\nor other fees, or otherwise in carrying on such business, including all\ndividends received on stocks and all interest received from federal,\nstate, municipal or other bonds.2. If the gross income of a taxpayer is derived from business carried\non both within and without the city, \"gross income\" means that\nproportion thereof which is derived from business carried on within the\ncity, to be allocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting\nfor each office or branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under\nrules and regulations prescribed by the director of finance.3. \"Gross income\" of a savings bank shall include the amount received\nby it in any taxable year as a distribution in liquidation of the mutual\nsavings bank fund.§ 21. Deductions. In computing net income there shall be allowed as\ndeductions:1. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the\nyear in carrying on business, including a reasonable allowance for\nsalaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered,\nand including rentals or other payments required to be made as a\ncondition to the continued use or possession for business purposes of\nproperty to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or\nin which such taxpayer has no equity.2. All interest paid or accrued during the year on indebtedness.3. Taxes, other than taxes on income or profits paid or accrued within\nthe year, imposed, first, by the authority of the United States, or of\nany of its possessions, or, second, by the authority of any state, or\nterritory, or any county, school district, municipality, or other taxing\nsubdivisions of any state or territory, not including those assessed\nagainst local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the\nproperty assessed, or, third, by the authority of any foreign\ngovernment, or, fourth, under the franchise tax on banking corporations\nimposed by article thirty-two of the tax law, or, fifth, any tax imposed\nunder this subpart.4. Losses sustained during the year and not compensated for by\ninsurance or otherwise, if incurred in business; unless in order to\nclearly reflect the income the losses should in the opinion of the\ndirector of finance be accounted for as of a different period. No\ndeduction shall be allowed for any loss claimed to have been sustained\nin any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where\nit appears that within thirty days before or after the date of such sale\nor other disposition the taxpayer has acquired substantially identical\nproperty, and the property so acquired is held by the taxpayer for any\nperiod after such sale or other disposition, unless such claim is made\nwith respect to a transaction made in the ordinary course of business.\nIf such acquisition is to the extent of part only of substantially\nidentical property, only a proportionate part of the loss shall be\ndisallowed.5. Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the year;\nor in the discretion of the director of finance a reasonable addition to\na reserve for bad debts. When satisfied that a debt is recoverable only\nin part, the director of finance may allow such debt to be charged off\nin part.6. A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of\nproperty used in business, including a reasonable allowance for\nobsolescence. In the case of any such property acquired before January\nfirst, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of such deduction shall be\nequal to the deduction properly taken for such property in reporting the\ntax due pursuant to article nine-b of the tax law. With respect to\nproperty such as described in subdivision twelve of this section, this\ndeduction may be computed and allowed as provided therein.7. If the gross income be derived from business carried on within and\nwithout the city, the deductions allowed by this section shall be\nallocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting for each\noffice or branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under rules and\nregulations to be prescribed by the director of finance.8. In the case of any taxpayer who establishes or maintains a pension\ntrust to provide for the payment of reasonable pensions to its\nemployees, there shall be allowed as a deduction (in addition to the\ncontributions to such trust during the taxable year to cover the pension\nliability accruing during the year, allowed as a deduction under\nsubdivision one of this section) a reasonable amount transferred or paid\ninto such trust during the taxable year in excess of such contributions,\nbut only if such amount (a) has not theretofore been allowable as a\ndeduction, and (b) is apportioned in equal parts over a period of ten\nconsecutive years beginning with the year in which the transfer or\npayment is made, or, under regulations of the director of finance,\ncovers not more than one-tenth of the total pension liability with\nrespect to services rendered prior to such taxable year; provided that\nsaid deduction shall be allowable only with respect to a taxable year\n(whether the year of the transfer or payment or a subsequent year) of\nthe taxpayer ending within or with a taxable year of the trust with\nrespect to which the trust, by reason of its purposes or activities, is\nexempt from federal income tax.9. The amount of the amortizable bond premium on a bond for the year\nshall be allowed as a deduction as hereinafter provided. In computing\nsuch deduction, (a) the amount of the bond premium shall be determined\nwith reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale\nor exchange) of such bond, and with reference to the amount payable on\nmaturity or on earlier call date, with adjustments proper to reflect\nunamortized bond premium with respect to the bond, for the period prior\nto the date as of which this subdivision becomes applicable with respect\nto the taxpayer with respect to such bond, and (b) the amortizable bond\npremium of the year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable\nto such year. The determination required in the preceding sentence shall\nbe made in accordance with the method of amortizing bond premium\nregularly employed by the holder of such bond, if such method is\nreasonable, and in all other cases in accordance with regulations of the\ndirector of finance prescribing reasonable methods of amortizing bond\npremium. This subdivision shall apply only if the taxpayer shall so\nelect, in accordance with regulations of the director of finance, and\nsuch election shall be made separately with respect to (1) bonds, the\ninterest of which is wholly taxable, and (2) bonds, the interest of\nwhich is wholly or partially tax exempt, for purposes of the income tax\nimposed by chapter one of the internal revenue code. If such election is\nmade with respect to any bond of the taxpayer described in clauses one\nor two hereof, it shall also apply to all bonds in the same class held\nby the taxpayer at the beginning of the first year to which the election\napplies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by it and shall be\nbinding for all subsequent years with respect to all such bonds of the\ntaxpayer, unless, upon the application by the taxpayer, the director of\nfinance permits the taxpayer, subject to such conditions as the director\nof finance deems necessary, to revoke such election. As used in this\nsubdivision the term \"bond\" means any bond, debenture, note or\ncertificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by any corporation\nand bearing interest (including any like obligation issued by a\ngovernment or political subdivision thereof), with interest coupons or\nin registered form, but does not include any such obligation which\nconstitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a\nkind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer\nif on hand at the close of the year, or any such obligation held by the\ntaxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its\ntrade or business.10. In the case of a savings bank and savings and loan association,\namounts paid or credited to depositors or holders of accounts as\ninterest or dividends on their deposits or withdrawable accounts, if\nsuch amounts are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice\nof intention to withdraw.11. A savings bank and savings and loan association may deduct in any\ntaxable year the amount of the repayment of any loan or advance from the\nmutual savings bank fund in computing its net income and the amount of\ninterest or dividends subject to the minimum tax under subdivision three\nof section twelve.12. (a) At the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted from\ngross income, or if gross income is derived from business carried on\nwithin and without this city, from the portion thereof allocated within\nthe city, depreciation with respect to any property such as described in\nparagraph (b) of this subdivision, not exceeding twice the depreciation\nallowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax\npurposes.(b) Such deduction shall be allowed only with respect to tangible\nproperty which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred\nsixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this city\nand used in the taxpayer's business, (i) the construction,\nreconstruction or erection of which is completed after December\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and then only with respect to\nthat portion of the basis thereof which is properly attributable to such\nconstruction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first,\nnineteen hundred sixty-five, or (ii) acquired after December\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, by purchase as defined in\nsection one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if\nthe original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced\nin this city and commenced after such date.(c) If the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this\nsubdivision exceeds the taxpayer's net income computed without the\nallowance of such deduction and without the allowance of any deduction\npursuant to subdivision six of this section with references to the same\nproperty, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year\nor years and may be deducted in computing net income for such year or\nyears.(d) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed\nof, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this\nsubdivision, the gain or loss thereon shall be computed by adjusting the\nbasis of such property to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the\ntaxpayer's gross income is derived from business carried on both within\nand without the city, shall be allocated within the city. Provided,\nhowever, that no loss shall be recognized for the purposes of this\nparagraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a\nperson whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section\none hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.§ 22. Items not deductible. In computing net income no deduction shall\nin any case be allowed in respect of:(a) Any amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent\nimprovements or betterments made to increase the value of any property.(b) Any amount expended in restoring property or in making good the\nexhaustion thereof for which an allowance is or has been made.SUBPART 2TAX ON NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATIONSAND PRODUCTION CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS§ 23. Imposition of tax. 1. Pursuant to the authority conferred by\nsection fifty-two hundred nineteen of the United States revised statutes\nand in conformity with the provisions contained in subdivision c of\nclause one of such section, every national banking association organized\nunder authority of the United States and located within the city, shall\nannually pay a tax, measured by its net income, to be computed, as\nprovided in this subpart, at the rate of four and one-half per centum\nexcept that for the year nineteen hundred seventy-one and those\nfollowing, as an alternative, at the rate of five and sixty-three one\nhundredths per centum, upon the basis of its net income for the calendar\nyear next preceding the date when such tax becomes due. Such tax shall\nbe for the calendar year next preceding the year in which it becomes\ndue; except that with respect to national banking associations required\nto file a declaration of estimated tax and to make payments on account\nof such estimated tax in accordance with the provisions of section\nthirty-five of this part, all payments of tax within a calendar year,\nwhether computed on the basis of net income for the current calendar\nyear or on the basis of net income for the preceding calendar year,\nshall be for the calendar year in which the payments are required to be\nmade. If, however, such a national banking association shall be\ndissolved between the thirty-first day of December and the succeeding\nsecond day of September, and shall not become merged or consolidated\nwith a corporation taxable under subpart one of this part, it shall pay\na tax for the period from the thirty-first day of December up to the\ntime of dissolution equal to that which would have been payable had it\nnot been dissolved, except that such tax shall be reduced one-third and\nan additional one-twelfth for each month, or major portion thereof,\nprior to such succeeding second day of September, during which such\ncorporation was so dissolved. If such dissolution occurs between the\nfifteenth day of March and the second day of September, and if such\ncorporation shall have filed its return on or before the fifteenth day\nof March as required by sections thirty and thirty-two of this part, it\nmay file a claim for refund as provided in section seventy-eight of this\ntitle, showing any reduction in tax to which it may be entitled as\nprovided in the preceding sentence; and if it shall be made to appear\nthat the amount of tax due is less than the amount as computed on the\nbasis of the original return, the director of finance shall adjust the\ncomputation of tax accordingly. If the amount of tax as so adjusted\nshall be less than the amount theretofore paid, the excess shall be\nrefunded by the comptroller as provided in subdivision one of section\nseventy-seven of this title.1-a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one, for the year\nnineteen hundred seventy-three and those following, such city may\nimpose, by local law, a surtax of fifteen per centum of the percentage\nof tax in effect for the year nineteen hundred seventy-two.2. In the event that the taxes imposed by this subpart shall be\nfinally determined to be unconstitutional or invalid for the reason that\nthey do not conform with the provisions of section fifty-two hundred\nnineteen of the United States revised statutes, then, in lieu of the\ntaxes imposed by the provisions of this subpart, every national banking\nassociation and every production credit association that otherwise would\nhave been subject to tax under this subpart shall be subject to the tax\nimposed under part two as of the effective date of part two, and all of\nthe provisions of part two, unless clearly inappropriate, shall be\napplicable except subdivision four of section three; and, in such event,\nany payments made, reports or returns filed or any act of the director\nof finance or of a taxpayer purportedly under this part shall be treated\nas though made, filed or done pursuant to part two.§ 24. Years for which imposed. The tax imposed by section\ntwenty-three of this part is imposed for each calendar year beginning\nwith the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six.§ 25. Ascertainment of gain or loss; exchange of property. 1. For the\npurpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale\nor other disposition of property, real, personal or mixed, the basis\nshall be the cost thereof, or the inventoried value if the inventory is\nmade in accordance with section twenty-six of this part.2. Notwithstanding subdivision one of this section, with respect to\ngain derived from the sale or other disposition of any property acquired\nprior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, except stock in\ntrade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly\nbe included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of\nthe taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to\ncustomers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, and accounts\nor notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of trade or business\nfrom the sale of such stock in trade or property, or for services\nrendered, net income shall not include(a) That portion of the gain included in determining net income\npursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect to each such\nproperty, which exceeds(b) The amount of gain, if any, that would be included in determining\nnet income pursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect to\neach such property if the basis of such property on the date of sale or\nother disposition were equal to its fair market value on January first,\nnineteen hundred sixty-six, plus or minus all adjustments to basis made\nwith respect to each such property in computing net income for periods\non or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six;\nprovided that the total adjustment to net income provided by this\nsubdivision shall not exceed the amount of the taxpayer's net gain from\nthe sale or other disposition of all such property, as determined\npursuant to subdivision one of this section.3. Upon the sale or exchange of property the amount of the gain or\nloss shall be determined in the manner prescribed by section fifteen of\nthis part and the basis of such property shall be determined in the\nmanner prescribed by section sixteen of this part.4. In the case of any bond, with respect to which a deduction for\namortizable bond premium is allowable under paragraph (i) of subdivision\none of section twenty-nine of this part, the basis for determining gain\nor loss shall be reduced by the total amount of such deductions so\nallowable.§ 26. Inventory. Whenever in the opinion of the director of finance\nthe use of inventories is necessary in order clearly to determine the\nincome of any taxpayer, inventory shall be taken by such taxpayer upon\nsuch basis as the director of finance may prescribe, conforming as\nnearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the banking business\nand most clearly reflecting the income.§ 27. Net income defined; computation. The term \"net income\" means the\ngross income of a taxpayer less the deductions allowed by this subpart.The net income shall be computed in accordance with the method of\naccounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but\nif no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method\nemployed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be\nmade upon such basis and in such manner as in the opinion of the\ndirector of finance does clearly reflect the income. In determining net\nincome, war losses, taxation of property recovered, and basis of\nproperty shall be treated in substantially the same manner as such\nlosses, recoveries and basis are treated under the applicable provisions\nof section thirteen hundred thirty-one of the internal revenue code.§ 28. Gross income defined. 1. The term \"gross income\" includes gains,\nprofit and income derived from the business, of whatever kind and in\nwhatever form paid, including gains, profits or income from dealings in\nproperty, whether real or personal, or gains, profits, or income\nreceived as compensation for services, as interest, rents, commissions,\nbrokerage or other fees, or otherwise in carrying on such business,\nincluding all dividends received on stocks and all interest received\nfrom federal, state, municipal or other bonds.2. If the gross income of such an association is derived from business\ncarried on both within and without the city, \"gross income\" means that\nproportion thereof which is derived from business carried on within the\ncity, to be allocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting\nfor each office or branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under\nrules and regulations prescribed by the director of finance.§ 29. Deductions. 1. In computing net income there shall be allowed as\ndeductions:(a) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during\nthe year in carrying on business, including a reasonable allowance for\nsalaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered,\nand including rentals or other payments required to be made as a\ncondition to the continued use or possession for business purposes of\nproperty to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or\nin which such taxpayer has no equity;(b) All interest paid or accrued during the year on indebtedness;(c) Taxes, other than taxes on income or profits paid or accrued\nwithin the year, imposed, first, by the authority of the United States,\nor of any of its possessions, or, second, by the authority of any state,\nor territory, or any county, school district, municipality, or other\ntaxing subdivisions of any state or territory, not including those\nassessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value\nof the property assessed, or, third, by the authority of any foreign\ngovernment;(d) Losses sustained during the year and not compensated for by\ninsurance or otherwise, if incurred in business; unless in order to\nclearly reflect the income the losses should in the opinion of the\ndirector of finance be accounted for as of a different period. No\ndeduction shall be allowed for any loss claimed to have been sustained\nin any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where\nit appears that within thirty days before or after the date of such sale\nor other disposition the taxpayer has acquired substantially identical\nproperty, and the property so acquired is held by the taxpayer for any\nperiod after such sale or other disposition, unless such claim is made\nwith respect to a transaction made in the ordinary course of business.\nIf such acquisition is to the extent of part only of substantially\nidentical property, only a proportionate part of the loss shall be\ndisallowed;(e) Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the year;\nor in the discretion of the director of finance a reasonable addition to\na reserve for bad debts. When satisfied that a debt is recoverable only\nin part, the director of finance may allow such debt to be charged off\nin part;(f) A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of\nproperty used in business, including a reasonable allowance for\nobsolescence. In the case of any such property acquired before January\nfirst, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of such deduction shall be\nequal to the deduction properly taken for such property in reporting the\ntax due pursuant to article nine-c of the tax law. With respect to\nproperty such as described in paragraph (j) of this subdivision, this\ndeduction may be computed and allowed as provided therein;(g) If the gross income be derived from business carried on within and\nwithout the city, the deductions allowed by this section shall be\nallocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting for each\noffice or branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under rules and\nregulations to be prescribed by the director of finance;(h) In the case of any taxpayer, who establishes or maintains a\npension trust to provide for the payment of reasonable pensions to its\nemployees, there shall be allowed as a deduction (in addition to the\ncontributions to such trust during the taxable year to cover the pension\nliability accruing during the year, allowed as a deduction under\nparagraph (a) of this subdivision) a reasonable amount transferred or\npaid into such trust during the taxable year in excess of such\ncontributions, but only if such amount (1) has not theretofore been\nallowable as a deduction, and (2) is apportioned in equal parts over a\nperiod of ten consecutive years beginning with the year in which the\ntransfer or payment is made; provided that said deduction shall be\nallowable only with respect to a taxable year (whether the year of the\ntransfer or payment or a subsequent year) of the taxpayer ending within\nor with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust, by\nreason of its purposes or activities is exempt from federal income tax;(i) The amount of the amortizable bond premium on a bond for the year\nshall be allowed as a deduction as hereinafter provided. In computing\nsuch deduction, (a) the amount of the bond premium shall be determined\nwith reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale\nor exchange) of such bond, and with reference to the amount payable on\nmaturity or on earlier call date, with adjustments proper to reflect\nunamortized bond premium with respect to the bond, for the period prior\nto the date as of which this paragraph becomes applicable with respect\nto the taxpayer with respect to such bond, and (b) the amortizable bond\npremium of the year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable\nto such year. The determinations required in the preceding sentence\nshall be made in accordance with the method of amortizing bond premium\nregularly employed by the holder of such bond, if such method is\nreasonable, and in all other cases in accordance with regulations of the\ndirector of finance prescribing reasonable methods of amortizing bond\npremium. This paragraph shall apply only if the taxpayer shall so elect,\nin accordance with regulations of the director of finance, and such\nelection shall be made separately with respect to (1) bonds, the\ninterest of which is wholly taxable, and (2) bonds, the interest of\nwhich is wholly or partially tax exempt, for purposes of the income tax\nimposed by chapter one of the internal revenue code. If such election is\nmade with respect to any bond of the taxpayer described in clauses one\nor two hereof, it shall also apply to all bonds in the same class held\nby the taxpayer at the beginning of the first year to which the election\napplies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by it and shall be\nbinding for all subsequent years with respect to all such bonds of the\ntaxpayer, unless, upon application by the taxpayer, the director of\nfinance permits the taxpayer, subject to such conditions as the director\nof finance deems necessary, to revoke such election. As used in this\nparagraph, the term \"bond\" means any bond, debenture, note, or\ncertificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by any corporation\nand bearing interest (including any like obligation issued by a\ngovernment or political subdivision thereof), with interest coupons or\nin registered form, but does not include any such obligation which\nconstitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a\nkind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer\nif on hand at the close of the year, or any such obligation held by the\ntaxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its\ntrade or business; and(j) (1) At the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted from\ngross income, or if gross income is derived from business carried on\nwithin and without this city, from the portion thereof allocated within\nthe city, depreciation with respect to any property such as described in\nsubparagraph (2) of this paragraph, not exceeding twice the depreciation\nallowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax\npurposes.(2) Such deduction shall be allowed only with respect to tangible\nproperty which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred\nsixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this city\nand used in the taxpayer's business, (i) the construction,\nreconstruction or erection of which is completed after December\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and then only with respect to\nthat portion of the basis thereof which is properly attributable to such\nconstruction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first,\nnineteen hundred sixty-five, or (ii) acquired after December\nthirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, by purchase as defined in\nsection one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if\nthe original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced\nin this city and commenced after such date.(3) If the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this\nsubdivision exceeds the taxpayer's net income computed without the\nallowance of such deduction and without the allowance of any deduction\npursuant to paragraph (f) of this section with reference to the same\nproperty, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year\nor years and may be deducted in computing net income for such year or\nyears.(4) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed\nof, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this\nparagraph, the gain or loss thereon shall be computed by adjusting the\nbasis of such property to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the\ntaxpayer's gross income is derived from business carried on both within\nand without the city, shall be allocated within the city. Provided,\nhowever, that no loss shall be recognized for the purposes of this\nparagraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a\nperson whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section\none hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.2. In computing net income no deduction shall in any case be allowed\nin respect of:(a) Any amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent\nimprovements or betterments made to increase the value of any property.(b) Any amount expended in restoring property or in making good the\nexhaustion thereof for which an allowance is or has been made.§ 30. Administration; procedure; provisions of law applicable. For the\npurpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this subpart, and\nexcept as otherwise provided in this subpart, income shall be computed,\ngain or loss ascertained, deductions made, apportionments and\nallocations determined, at the same time and subject to the same\nlimitations and conditions, in so far as practicable, as is provided by\nsubpart one of this part in relation to the tax imposed by such subpart.§ 31. Tax on production credit associations. Pursuant to the authority\nconferred by the federal farm credit act of nineteen hundred\nthirty-three, every production credit association organized under the\nauthority of the United States and located within the city after the\nstock held in it by the federal production credit corporation has been\nretired shall annually pay a tax measured by its net income, which shall\nbe computed in the same manner as the tax imposed upon national banking\nassociations by section twenty-three and shall be subject to the\nprovisions of sections twenty-four to thirty inclusive.SUBPART 3ADMINISTRATION FOR SUBPARTS 1 AND 2§ 32. Taxpayers' returns. Every taxpayer, on or before March\nfifteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and annually thereafter, shall\nmake a return subscribed by the taxpayer and affirmed by him to be true\nunder the penalties of perjury to the director of finance, for the\ncalendar year next preceding, as to the business or that portion of the\nbusiness of such taxpayer the income from which is the basis of taxation\nunder this part, except that every trust company and savings bank which\nshall become incorporated between the thirty-first day of December and\nthe succeeding first day of July, shall make its return for such period\non or before September first, and every taxpayer, other than a trust\ncompany and savings bank, which shall commence to do business in the\ncity or become located in the city, shall make its return for the\ncalendar year in which it commences to do business or becomes located,\non or before the twentieth day of January of the year succeeding such\ncalendar year, and except that every taxpayer, other than a trust\ncompany and savings bank, which shall be dissolved, cease to do business\nin the city or cease to be located in the city, between the thirty-first\nday of December and the succeeding sixteenth day of March and shall not\nbecome merged or consolidated with another corporation taxable under the\nsame subpart, shall make its return for such period on or before the\ndate of such dissolution, or cessation of business, and every trust\ncompany and savings bank which shall be dissolved, and shall not become\nmerged or consolidated with another corporation taxable under the same\nsubpart, shall make its return, for the period for which it is taxable\nunder subdivision seven of section twelve of this part on or before the\ndate of such dissolution. Such return shall be in such form and contain\nsuch information as the director of finance may require for the purpose\nof making any computation or otherwise performing its duty under this\npart. Such return shall state specifically the items of gross income\nderived from such business and the deductions allowed by this part, the\nnet income which is the basis of the tax, and the amount of tax due.\nThe return shall be subscribed by the president, vice-president,\ntreasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer or any other\nofficer of the taxpayer duly authorized so to act. The fact that an\nindividual's name is signed on the return shall be prima facie evidence\nthat such individual is authorized to subscribe and affirm the return on\nbehalf of the corporation. Blank forms of return shall be furnished by\nthe director of finance upon application, but failure to secure the form\nshall not relieve any taxpayer from the obligation of making any return\nherein required. An automatic extension of three months for the filing\nof its annual return shall be allowed any taxpayer if, within the time\nprescribed herein for the filing thereof, such taxpayer files with the\ndirector of finance an application for extension in such form as the\ndirector of finance may prescribe by regulation and pays on or before\nthe date of such filing the amount properly estimated as its tax. The\ndirector of finance may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing\na return, which may be in addition to any automatic extension allowed\nunder the preceding sentence, whenever in its judgment good cause exists\nand shall keep a record of every such extension and the reason therefor.\nNo such extension or extensions shall aggregate more than three months,\nexclusive of any automatic extension.If the amount of taxable income for any year of any taxpayer as\nreturned to the United States treasury department is changed or\ncorrected by the commissioner of internal revenue or other officer of\nthe United States or other competent authority, or if a taxpayer,\npursuant to subsection (d) of section sixty-two hundred thirteen of the\ninternal revenue code, executes a notice of waiver of the restrictions\nprovided in subsection (a) of said section, such taxpayer shall report\nsuch change or corrected taxable income or such execution of such notice\nof waiver and the changes or corrections of his federal taxable income\non which it is based, within ninety days after such execution or the\nfinal determination of such change or correction, or on its next return\nunder this part, or as required by the director of finance, and shall\nconcede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is\nerroneous. Any taxpayer filing an amended return with such department\nshall also file within ninety days thereafter an amended return with the\ndirector of finance which shall contain such information as it shall\nrequire.§ 33. Consolidated returns. Corporations which are affiliated may, if\nauthorized, and shall, if required, by the director of finance, under\nregulations prescribed by the director of finance, make a consolidated\nreturn for the purpose of this part. In any case in which a tax is\nassessed upon the basis of a consolidated return, the total tax shall be\ncomputed in the first instance as a unit and shall then be assessed upon\nthe respective affiliated corporations in such proportions as may be\nagreed upon among them, or in the absence of any such agreement, then on\nthe basis of the net income properly assignable to each.§ 34. Payment of tax. Each taxpayer shall, at the time of filing its\nreturn, pay to the director of finance(a) the amount of tax payable hereunder as the same shall appear from\nthe face of the return, or(b) if payments of estimated tax have been made pursuant to section\nthirty-five of this part, the balance, if any, of the tax payable\nhereunder, as the same shall appear from the face of the return, after\napplying thereto any payments made pursuant to said section.\nIf the time for filing the return shall be extended, the taxpayer shall\npay in addition interest at the rate of six percentum per annum from the\ntime when the return was originally required to be filed to the time of\npayment upon the amount by which the tax, or the portion thereof payable\nwhen the return was required to be filed, exceeds the amount then paid:(1) a payment made on or before the date of filing of an application\nfor an automatic extension shall be deemed properly estimated if it is\neither (A) not less than ninety percentum of the tax as finally\ndetermined, or (B) not less than the tax shown on the taxpayer's return\nfor the preceding taxable year, if such preceding year was a taxable\nyear of twelve months; and(2) the time when a return is required to be filed shall be determined\nwithout regard to any extension of time for filing such return.§ 35. Declaration of estimated tax; payments on account of estimated\ntax. 1. Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this part shall\nmake a declaration of the estimated tax upon the basis of its net income\nfor the current calendar year, containing such information as the\ndirector of finance may prescribe by regulations or instructions, if\nsuch estimated tax can reasonably be expected to exceed one thousand\ndollars.2. The term \"estimated tax\" means the amount which a taxpayer\nestimates to be the tax imposed by this part upon the basis of its net\nincome for the current calendar year, less the amount which it estimates\nto be the sum of any credits allowable against the tax.3. A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed on or before June\nfifteenth of the calendar year upon the net income of which the tax is\nbased, except that if the requirements of subdivision one are first met:(a) after June first and before October second of such calendar year,\nthe declaration shall be filed on or before October fifteenth, or(b) after October first of such calendar year, the declaration shall\nbe filed on or before January fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year.Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no\ndeclaration need be filed prior to the sixtieth day after the date this\ntitle becomes effective.4. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under regulations of the\ndirector of finance.5. If, on or before February fifteenth of the succeeding year, a\ntaxpayer files its return for the calendar year upon the net income of\nwhich the declaration is required to be based, and pays therewith the\nbalance, if any, of the full amount of the tax shown to be due on the\nreturn,(a) such return shall be considered as its declaration if no\ndeclaration was required to be filed during such calendar year, but is\notherwise required to be filed on or before January fifteenth of the\nsucceeding year pursuant to subdivision three,(b) such return shall be considered as an amendment permitted by\nsubdivision four to be filed on or before January fifteenth if the tax\nshown on the return is greater than the estimated tax shown on a\ndeclaration previously made.6. The director of finance may grant a reasonable extension of time,\nnot to exceed three months, for the filing of any declaration required\npursuant to this section, on such terms and conditions as he may\nrequire.7. Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this part shall pay\nwith the return of tax, if any, required to be filed upon the basis of\nits net income for the preceding calendar year, or with an application\nfor extension of the time for filing such return, an amount equal to\ntwenty-five per centum of the preceding year's tax, if such preceding\nyear's tax exceeded one thousand dollars.8. The estimated tax with respect to which a declaration for such\ncalendar year is required pursuant to this section shall be paid as\nfollows:(a) If the declaration is filed on or before June fifteenth, the\nestimated tax shown thereon, after applying thereto the amount, if any,\npaid during the same calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall\nbe paid in three equal installments. One of such installments shall be\npaid at the time of the filing of the declaration, one shall be paid on\nthe following October fifteenth, and one on the following January\nfifteenth.(b) If the declaration is filed after June fifteenth and not after\nOctober fifteenth of such calendar year, and is not required to be filed\non or before June fifteenth of such calendar year, the estimated tax\nshown on such declaration, after applying thereto the amount, if any,\npaid during the same calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall\nbe paid in two equal installments. One of such installments shall be\npaid at the time of the filing of the declaration and one shall be paid\non the following January fifteenth.(c) If the declaration is filed after October fifteenth of such\ncalendar year, and is not required to be filed on or before October\nfifteenth of such calendar year, the estimated tax shown on such\ndeclaration, after applying thereto the amount, if any, paid in respect\nof such calendar year pursuant to subdivision seven, shall be paid in\nfull at the time of the filing of the declaration.(d) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed therefor, or\nafter the expiration of any extension of time therefor, paragraphs (b)\nand (c) of this subdivision shall not apply, and there shall be paid at\nthe time of such filing all installments of estimated tax payable at or\nbefore such time, and the remaining installments shall be paid at the\ntimes at which, and in the amounts in which, they would have been\npayable if the declaration had been filed when due.9. If any amendment of a declaration is filed, the remaining\ninstallments, if any, shall be ratably increased or decreased (as the\ncase may be) to reflect any increase or decrease in the estimated tax by\nreason of such amendment, and if any amendment is made after October\nfifteenth of the calendar year, any increase in the estimated tax by\nreason thereof shall be paid at the time of making such amendment.10. Any amount paid pursuant to subdivision seven shall be applied\nafter payment as a first installment against the estimated tax of the\ntaxpayer shown on the declaration next required to be filed pursuant to\nthis section or, if no declaration of estimated tax is required to be\nfiled by the taxpayer pursuant to this section, any such amount shall be\nconsidered a payment on account of the tax shown on the return of tax\nrequired to be filed by the taxpayer upon the basis of its net income\nfor the calendar year during which such amount was paid.11. Notwithstanding the provisions of section seventy-nine of this\ntitle or of section three-a of the general municipal law, if any amount\npaid pursuant to subdivision seven, exceeds the tax shown on the return\nrequired to be filed by the taxpayer upon the basis of its net income\nfor the calendar year during which the amount was paid, interest shall\nbe allowed and paid on the amount by which the amount so paid pursuant\nto such subdivision exceeds such tax, at the rate of six per centum per\nannum from the date of payment of the amount so paid pursuant to such\nsubdivision to March fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year,\nprovided, however, that no interest shall be allowed or paid under this\nsubdivision if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.12. As used in this section, \"the preceding year's tax\" means the tax\nimposed upon the taxpayer by this part upon the basis of its net income\nfor the preceding calendar year, or, for purposes of computing the first\ninstallment of estimated tax when an application has been filed for\nextension of time for filing the return required to be filed for such\npreceding calendar year, the amount properly estimated pursuant to\nsection thirty-four of this part as the tax imposed upon the basis of\nits net income for such calendar year.13. This section shall apply to an income period of less than twelve\nmonths in accordance with regulations of the director of finance.14. The director of finance may grant a reasonable extension of time,\nnot to exceed six months, for payment of any installment of estimated\ntax required pursuant to this section, on such terms and conditions as\nhe may require, including the furnishing of a bond or other security by\nthe taxpayer in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which any\nextension of time for payment is granted, provided however that interest\nat the rate of six per centum per annum for the period of the extension\nshall be charged and collected on the amount for which any extension of\ntime for payment is granted under this subdivision.15. A taxpayer may elect to pay any installment of estimated tax prior\nto the date prescribed in this section for payment thereof.§ 36. Real property taxable. Nothing in this part shall be\nconstrued to exempt the real property of any taxpayer from taxation to\nthe same extent, according to its value, as other real property is\ntaxed.PART VTRANSPORTATION CORPORATION TAX§ 61. Tax on transportation corporations and associations. 1. The\nterm \"corporation\" as used in this part shall include any business\nconducted by a trustee or trustees wherein interest or ownership is\nevidenced by certificates or other written instruments.2. For the privilege of doing business or of holding property in the\ncity every corporation, joint stock company or association formed for or\nprincipally engaged in the conduct of aviation, steamboat, ferry (except\na ferry company operating between any of the boroughs of the city under\na lease granted by the city), or navigation business, or formed for or\nprincipally engaged in the conduct of two or more of such businesses,\nexcept a corporation, joint stock company or association subject to\ntaxation under a local law of the city imposed on utilities and vendors\nof utility services, shall pay, in advance, an annual tax to be computed\nupon the basis of the amount of its capital stock within the city during\nthe preceding year, and upon each dollar of such amount.3. The measure of the amount of capital stock in the city, except as\nhereinafter provided, shall be such a portion of the issued capital\nstock as the gross assets, exclusive of obligations issued by the United\nStates and cash on hand and on deposit, employed in any business within\nthe city, bear to the gross assets, exclusive of obligations issued by\nthe United States and cash on hand and on deposit, wherever employed in\nbusiness. Provided, however, that in the case of a corporation taxable\nhereunder only for the privilege of holding property, the measure shall\nbe such a portion of the issued capital stock as the gross assets,\nexclusive of obligations issued by the United States and cash on hand\nand on deposit, located within the city, bear to the gross assets,\nexclusive of obligations issued by the United States and cash on hand\nand on deposit, wherever located. The capital of a corporation invested\nin the stock of another corporation shall be deemed to be assets located\nwhere the assets of the issuing corporation, other than patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks, contracts and good will, are located.4. Every corporation, joint stock company or association subject to\ntaxation under this section shall, in any event, pay annually a minimum\ntax of not less than ten dollars nor less than one mill on each dollar\nof such a portion of the net value of its issued capital stock, which\nnet value for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to be not\nless than five dollars per share, as may be determined upon such of the\nbases herein provided for the measurement thereof as is applicable. The\nterm \"net value\" as used in this section shall be construed to mean not\nless than the difference between a corporation's assets and liabilities,\nand not less than the average price at which such stock sold during the\nyear covered by the report which forms the basis for the tax. But if the\ndividends paid on the par value of any kind of capital stock during any\nyear ending with the thirty-first day of December amount to six or more\nthan six per centum, the tax upon such kind of capital stock shall be at\nthe rate of one-quarter of a mill for each one per centum of dividends\npaid and shall be computed upon the par value of such capital stock,\nunless such a tax be less than the minimum tax hereinbefore provided in\nthis section and the director of finance shall, for such purpose, make a\nfair and equitable apportionment of the assets of the corporation, joint\nstock company or association, between or among the different kinds of\nstock.5. If such corporation, joint stock company or association shall have\nmore than one kind of capital stock, and upon one of such kinds of stock\na dividend or dividends amounting to six or more than six per centum\nupon the part value thereof, has been paid, and upon the other no\ndividend has been paid, or the dividend or dividends paid thereon amount\nto less than six per centum upon the par value thereof, then the tax\nshall be fixed upon each kind as hereinbefore provided.6. The dividend rate for a corporation having stock without nominal or\npar value shall be determined by dividing the amount paid as a dividend\nor dividends during the year by the amount paid in on such stock and, if\nthe rate is six per centum or more, the rate of one-quarter of a mill\nfor each one per centum of dividends shall be applied to the amount paid\nin on such stock, unless such tax be less than the minimum tax\nhereinbefore in this section provided for. Any consideration given by a\ncorporation for the purchase of its own stock in excess of the\nconsideration received by it for the issuance of such stock shall for\nthe purposes of this section, be considered as a dividend.7.

A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or\nregistered mail to the taxpayer at its last known address in or out of\nthe city. If the taxpayer has terminated its existence, a notice of\ndeficiency may be mailed to its last known address in or out of the\ncity, and such notice shall be sufficient for purposes of this part. If\nthe director of finance has received notice that a person is acting for\nthe taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity, a copy of such notice shall also\nbe mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.2.

For exception in the case of\njudicial review of the decision of the director of finance, see\nsubdivision three of section eighty-one.4. Exceptions for mathematical errors.--If a mathematical error\nappears on a return (including an overstatement of the amount paid as\nestimated tax), the director of finance shall notify the taxpayer that\nan amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and\nthat such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered\nas a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision\nsix of section seventy-eight (limiting credits or refunds after petition\nto the director of finance), or subdivision two of section eighty\n(authorizing the filing of a petition with the director of finance based\non a notice of deficiency), nor shall such assessment or collection be\nprohibited by the provisions of subdivision three of this section.5. Exception where change in federal taxable income is not reported.--(a) If the taxpayer fails to comply with part two or part three of\nthis title in not reporting a change or correction or renegotiation, or\ncomputation or recomputation of tax, increasing or decreasing its\nfederal taxable income as reported on its federal income tax return or\nin not reporting a change or correction or renegotiation, or computation\nor a recomputaton of tax, which is treated in the same manner as if it\nwere a deficiency for federal income tax purposes or in not filing an\namended return or in not reporting the execution of a notice of waiver\nexecuted pursuant to subsection (d) of section six thousand two hundred\nthirteen of the internal revenue code instead of the mode and time of\nassessment provided for in subdivision two of this section, the\ncommissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such\nincreased or decreased federal taxable income by mailing to the taxpayer\na notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency,\nand such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and\npenalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date\nsuch notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of\nsuch notice a report of the federal change or correction or\nrenegotiation, or computation or recomputation of tax, or an amended\nreturn, where such return was required by part two or part three, is\nfiled accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal\ndetermination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.(b) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for\nthe purposes of this section, subdivision six of section seventy-eight\n(limiting credits or refunds after petition to the director of finance),\nor subdivision two of section eighty (authorizing the filing of a\npetition with the director of finance based on a notice of deficiency),\nnor shall such assessment or the collection thereof be prohibited by the\nprovisions of subdivision three of this section.(c) If the taxpayer has terminated its existence, a notice of\nadditional tax due may be mailed to its last known address in or out of\nthe city, and such notice shall be sufficient for purposes of this part.\nIf the director of finance has received notice that a person is acting\nfor the taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity, a copy of such notice shall\nalso be mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.6. Waiver of restrictions.--The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or\nnot a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive the\nrestrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or any part of\nthe deficiency by a signed notice in writing filed with the director of\nfinance.7. Two or more corporations.--In the case of a combined return under\npart two or a consolidated return under part three of two or more\ncorporations, the director of finance may determine a deficiency of tax\nunder part two or part three with respect to the entire tax due upon\nsuch return against any taxpayer included therein. In the case of a\ntaxpayer which might have been included in such a return under part two\nor part three when the tax was originally reported, the director of\nfinance may determine a deficiency of tax under part two or part three\nagainst such taxpayer and against any other taxpayers which might have\nbeen included in such a return.8. Deficiency defined.--For purposes of this part, a deficiency means\nthe amount of the tax imposed by the named parts, or any of them, less\n(a) the amount shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the\nreturn was made or the tax computed by it or by the director of\nfinance), and less (b) the amounts previously assessed (or collected\nwithout assessment) as a deficiency and plus (c) the amount of any\nrebates. For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by part two\nor part three of this title and the tax shown on the return shall both\nbe determined without regard to any payment of estimated tax; and a\nrebate means so much of an abatement, credit, refund or other repayment\n(whether or not erroneous) as was made on the ground that the amounts\nentering into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance in favor\nof the taxpayer.9. Exception where change or correction of sales and compensating use\ntax liability is not reported.(a) If a taxpayer fails to comply with part two of this title in not\nreporting a change or correction of its sales and compensating use tax\nliability or in not filing a copy of an amended return or report\nrelating to its sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the\nmode and time of assessment provided for in subdivision two of this\nsection, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon\nsuch changed or corrected sales and compensating use tax liability, as\nsame relates to credits claimed under part two of this title by mailing\nto the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of\nthe deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest,\nadditions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed\nassessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days\nafter the mailing of such notice a report of the state change or\ncorrection or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was\nrequired by part two, is filed accompanied by a statement showing\nwherein such state determination and such notice of additional tax due\nare erroneous.(b) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for\nthe purposes of this section, subdivision six of section seventy-eight\n(limiting credits or refunds after petition to the commissioner of\nfinance), or subdivision two of section eighty (authorizing the filing\nof a petition with the commissioner of finance based on a notice of\ndeficiency), nor shall such assessment or the collection thereof be\nprohibited by the provisions of subdivision three of this section.(c) If the taxpayer has terminated its existence, notice of additional\ntax due may be mailed to its last known address in or out of the city,\nand such notice shall be sufficient for purposes of this part. If the\ncommissioner of finance has received notice that a person is acting for\nthe taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity, a copy of such notice shall also\nbe mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.§ 73. Assessment. 1. Assessment date.--The amount of tax which a\nreturn shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return would have\nshown to be due but for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be\nassessed on the date of filing of the return (including any amended\nreturn showing an increase of tax). If a notice of deficiency has been\nmailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on\nthe date specified in subdivision two of section seventy-two if no\npetition to the director of finance is filed, or if a petition is filed,\nthen upon the date when a decision of the director of finance\nestablishing the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If a report or\nan amended return filed pursuant to part two or part three of this title\nconcedes the accuracy of a federal adjustment or change or correction or\nrenegotiation, or computation or recomputation of tax, any deficiency in\ntax under part two or part three of this title resulting therefrom shall\nbe deemed to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended\nreturn, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding section\nseventy-four. If a report filed pursuant to part two of this title\nconcedes the accuracy of a state change or correction of sales and\ncompensating use tax liability, any deficiency in tax under part two of\nthis title resulting therefrom shall be deemed assessed on the date of\nfiling such report, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding\nsection seventy-four. If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed\nin subdivision five of section seventy-two, has been mailed, the amount\nof the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified\nin such subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such\nnotice a report of the federal adjustment or change or correction or\nrenegotiation or computation or recomputation of tax, or an amended\nreturn, where such return was required by part two or part three of this\ntitle, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal\ndetermination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. If a\nnotice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision nine of\nsection seventy-two, has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall\nbe deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such subdivision\nunless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of\nthe state change or correction, or a copy of an amended return or\nreport, where such copy was required by part two of this title, is filed\naccompanied by a statement showing wherein such state determination and\nsuch notice of additional tax due are erroneous.

The commissioner of finance may\nby regulations provide for the determination of the base period\npercentage in the case of reorganizations, new corporations, and other\nsimilar circumstances, and(B) the term \"filing month\" means the month in which the installment\nis required to be paid.5.

For purposes of the\npreceding sentence, the term \"understatement\" means the excess of the\namount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable\nyear, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return.\nThe amount of the understatement under the preceding sentence shall be\nreduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to\nthe tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was\nsubstantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to\nwhich the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are\nadequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the\nreturn.

The\namount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax\npaid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the\nclaim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus\nthe portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable\nunder subdivision one if a claim had been filed on the date the\nagreement was executed.3.

If the report or amended return required by part two or part\nthree of this title is not filed within the ninety day period therein\nspecified, interest on any resulting refund or credit shall cease to\naccrue after such ninetieth day. The amount of such credit or refund--(c) shall be computed without change of the allocation of income or\ncapital upon which the taxpayer's return (or any additional assessment)\nwas based, and(d) shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable\nto such decrease or increase in federal taxable income or federal tax or\nto such federal change or correction or renegotiation, or computation or\nrecomputation of tax.This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount\nfor which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this\nsubdivision.4.

Such petition may also assert a claim\nfor refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the\nlimitations of subdivision seven of section seventy-eight. For special\nrestriction where the notice of deficiency relates to a proposed\nassessment made as a result of (a) a net operating loss carryback, (b)\nan increase or decrease in federal taxable income or federal tax, or (c)\na federal change or correction or renegotiation, or computation or\nrecomputation of tax, which is treated in the same manner as if it were\na deficiency for federal income tax purposes, see paragraph (g) of\nsubdivision three of section seventy-four.3. Petition for refund.--A taxpayer may file a petition with the\ndirector of finance for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if--(a) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim for refund with the director\nof finance,(b) the taxpayer has not previously filed with the director of finance\na timely petition under subdivision two for the same taxable year unless\nthe petition under this subdivision relates to a separate claim for\ncredit or refund properly filed under subdivision six of section\nseventy-eight, and(c) either (1) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or\n(2) the director of finance has mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or\ncertified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in\npart.No petition under this subsection shall be filed more than two years\nafter the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to\nthe expiration of such two year period it has been extended by written\nagreement between the taxpayer and the director of finance. If a\ntaxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that he be mailed a\nnotice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this\nsubdivision for filing a petition for refund shall begin on the date\nsuch waiver is filed.4. Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.--(a) Petition for redetermination of deficiency.--If a taxpayer files\nwith the director of finance a petition for redetermination of a\ndeficiency, the director of finance shall have power to determine a\ngreater deficiency then asserted in the notice of deficiency and to\ndetermine if there should be assessed any addition to tax or penalty\nprovided in section seventy-six, if claim therefor is asserted at or\nbefore the hearing under rules of the director of finance.(b) Petition for refund.--If the taxpayer files with the director of\nfinance a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the director\nof finance may(1) determine a deficiency for such year as to any amount of\ndeficiency asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the director\nof finance and within the period in which an assessment would be timely\nunder section seventy-four, or(2) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in\nthe petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the same\ntaxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of\nthe director of finance.(c) Opportunity to respond.--A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable\nopportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the director of\nfinance under this subdivision.(d) Restriction on further notices of deficiency.--If the taxpayer\nfiles a petition with the commissioner of finance under this section, no\nnotice of deficiency under section seventy-two may thereafter be issued\nby the commissioner of finance for the same taxable year, except in case\nof fraud or with respect to an increase or decrease in federal taxable\nincome or federal tax or a federal change or correction or\nrenegotiation, or computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated\nin the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal income tax\npurposes, required to be reported under part two or part three of this\ntitle or with respect to a state change or correction of sales and\ncompensating use tax liability required to be reported under part two of\nthis title.5. Burden of proof.--In any case before the director of finance under\nthis part, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for\nthe following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the\ndirector of finance:(a) whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to\nevade tax;(b) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of\na taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;\nand(c) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency\nwhere such increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency\nwas mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase\nin deficiency is the result of an increase or decrease in federal\ntaxable income or federal tax or a federal change or correction or\nrenegotiation, or computation or recomputation of tax, which is treated\nin the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal income tax\npurposes, required to be reported under part two or part three of this\ntitle, and of which increase, decrease, change or correction or\nrenegotiation, or computation or recomputation, the commissioner of\nfinance had no notice at the time he mailed the notice of deficiency or\nunless such increase in deficiency is the result of a change or\ncorrection of sales and compensating use tax liability required to be\nreported under part two of this title, and of which change or correction\nthe commissionr of finance had no notice at the time he mailed the\nnotice of deficiency.6. Evidence of related federal or state determination.--Evidence of a\nfederal or state determination relating to issues raised in a case\nbefore the director of finance under this section shall be admissible,\nunder rules established by the director of finance.7. Jurisdiction over other years.--The director of finance shall\nconsider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be\nnecessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so\ndoing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for\nany other year has been overpaid or underpaid.§ 81. Review of director's decision. 1. General.--A decision of the\ndirector of finance shall be subject to judicial review at the instance\nof any taxpayer affected thereby in the manner provided by law for the\nreview of a final decision or action of administrative agencies of the\ncity. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made within\nfour months after notice of the decision is sent by certified or\nregistered mail to the taxpayer.2. Judicial review exclusive remedy of taxpayer.--The review of a\ndecision of the director of finance provided by this section shall be\nthe exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial\ndetermination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by\nthe named parts.3. Assessment pending review; review bond.--Irrespective of any\nrestrictions on the assessment and collection of deficiencies, the\ndirector of finance may assess a deficiency after the expiration of the\nperiod specified in subdivision one, notwithstanding that an application\nfor judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by\nthe taxpayer unless the taxpayer, at or before the time the taxpayer's\napplication for review is made, has paid the deficiency, has deposited\nwith the director of finance the amount of the deficiency, or has filed\nwith the director of finance a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under\nsubdivision eight of section eighty-five) in the amount of the portion\nof the deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in respect of\nwhich the application for review is made and all costs and charges which\nmay accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding,\nincluding costs of all appeals, and with surety approved by a justice of\nthe supreme court of the state, conditioned upon the payment of the\ndeficiency (including interest and other amounts) as finally determined\nand such costs and charges. If as a result of a waiver of the\nrestrictions on the assessment and collection of a deficiency any part\nof the amount determined by the director of finance is paid after the\nfiling of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the\ntaxpayer, be proportionately reduced.4. Credit, refund or abatement after review.--If the amount of a\ndeficiency determined by the director of finance is disallowed in whole\nor in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be\ncredited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim\ntherefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.5. Date of finality of director of finance decision.--A decision of\nthe director of finance shall become final upon the expiration of the\nperiod specified in subdivision one for making an application for\nreview, if no such application has been duly made within such time, or\nif such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for\nall further judicial review, or upon the rendering by the director of\nfinance of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on\nreview. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an\napplication for review, the decision of the director of finance shall be\ndeemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified or\nregistered mail to the taxpayer.§ 82. Mailing rules; holidays. 1. Timely mailing.--If any claim,\nstatement, notice, petition, or other document (including to the extent\nauthorized by the director of finance, a return or a declaration of\nestimated tax) required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or\nbefore a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this part\nor of the named parts is, after such period or such date, delivered by\nUnited States mail to the director of finance, bureau, office, officer\nor person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed,\nthe date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be\ndeemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if\nthe postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the\nprescribed date for the filing of such document, determined with regard\nto any extension granted for such filing, and only if such document was\ndeposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the\ndirector of finance, bureau, office, officer or person with which or\nwith whom the document is required to be filed. If any document is sent\nby United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie\nevidence that such document was delivered to the director of finance,\nbureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the\nextent that the director of finance shall prescribe by regulation,\ncertified mail may be used in lieu of registered mail under this\nsubdivision.

Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.--When the last day\nprescribed under authority of this part or the named parts (including\nany extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday,\nSunday, or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall\nbe considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which\nis not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.§ 83. Collection, levy and liens.--1. Collection procedures.--The\ntaxes imposed by the named parts shall be collected by the director of\nfinance, and he may establish the mode or time for the collection of any\namount due him thereunder if not otherwise specified. The director of\nfinance shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected\nthereunder. The director of finance may authorize banks or trust\ncompanies which are depositaries or financial agents of the city to\nreceive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under the named parts in\nsuch manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the director of\nfinance may prescribe; and the director of finance shall prescribe the\nmanner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such\nbanks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the\ndirector of finance.2. Notice and demand for tax.--The director of finance shall as soon\nas practicable give notice to each taxpayer liable for any amount of\ntax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but\nremains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such\nnotice shall be left at the principal office of the taxpayer in the city\nor shall be sent by mail to such taxpayer's last known address. Except\nwhere the director of finance determines that collection would be\njeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date\n(including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such\ntax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.3. Issuance of warrant after notice and demand.--If any corporation or\nother person liable under the named parts for the payment of any tax,\naddition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same\nwithin ten days after notice and demand therefor is given to such\ncorporation or other person under subdivision two, the director of\nfinance may within six years after the date of such assessment issue a\nwarrant under his official seal directed to the sheriff of any county of\nthe state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance,\ncommanding him to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of\nsuch corporation or other person for the payment of the amount assessed,\nwith the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to\nthe director of finance and pay to him the money collected by virtue\nthereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If the\ndirector of finance finds that the collection of the tax or other amount\nis in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may\nbe made by the director of finance and upon failure or refusal to pay\nsuch tax or other amount the director of finance may issue a warrant\nwithout regard to the ten-day period provided in this subdivision.4. Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created.--Any sheriff or\nofficer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision three shall\nwithin five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the\nappropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment\ndocket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer\nmentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other\namounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is\nfiled; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real,\npersonal and other property of the taxpayer.5. Judgment.--When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the\ndirector of finance shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to have\nobtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.6. Execution.--The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon\nproceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in the\nsame manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against\nproperty upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be\nentitled to the same fees for his services in executing the warrant, to\nbe collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the\ndepartment of finance may proceed in any county or counties of this\nstate and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon\nsheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of\nactual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.7. Foreign corporations.--Where a notice and demand under subdivision\ntwo shall have been given to a foreign corporation or other person who\nis not then a resident, and it appears to the director of finance that\nit is not practicable to find in the state property of such foreign\ncorporation or nonresident person sufficient to pay the entire balance\nof tax or other amount owing by such foreign corporation or nonresident\nperson, the director of finance may, in accordance with subdivision\nthree, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the\ndepartment of finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by\ncertified or registered mail to such foreign corporation or nonresident\nperson at its last known address, subject to the rules for mailing\nprovided in subdivision one of section seventy-two. Such warrant shall\ncommand the officer or employee to proceed in New York county, and he\nshall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant\nand obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the\ndirector of finance may authorize the institution of any action or\nproceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any\nprocedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New\nYork could be collected or enforced. The director of finance may also,\nin his discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of\ncollecting, outside the state, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax,\npenalties or interest which have been assessed under this part or under\nany of the named parts, against foreign corporations or other\nnon-resident persons, may fix the compensation of such agents and\ncounsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully\navailable for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other\nsecurity for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and\nin such amount as the director of finance shall deem proper and\nsufficient.8. Action by city for recovery of taxes.--Action may be brought by the\ncorporation counsel at the instance of the director of finance to\nrecover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or\ninterest which have been assessed under this part or under the named\nparts within six years prior to the date the action is commenced.9. Release of lien.--The director of finance, if it finds that the\ninterests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such\nconditions as it may require, may release any property from the lien of\nany warrant filed under subdivision four or seven for unpaid taxes,\nadditions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to this section,\nand such release may be recorded in the office of any recording officer\nin which such warrant has been filed.10. Lien from due date of return.--(a) In addition to any other lien\nprovided for in this section, each tax imposed by the named parts shall\nbecome a lien on the date on which the return is required to be filed\n(without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), except\nthat such tax shall become a lien not later than the date the taxpayer\nceases to be subject to the tax imposed by any of the named parts, or to\ndo business in this state in a corporate or organized capacity. Each\nsuch tax shall be a lien and binding upon the real and personal property\nof the taxpayer, or of a transferee liable to pay the same, until the\nsame is paid in full, except that no lien for any additional tax\nassessed pursuant to this part shall be enforceable against property\nwhich prior to the issuance to the taxpayer of a notice of deficiency\nunder section seventy-two had been transferred in good faith to a bona\nfide transferee for value. But the lien of each such tax shall be\nsubject to the lien of any mortgage indebtedness existing against real\nproperty previous to the time when the tax became a lien and where such\nmortgage indebtedness has been incurred in good faith and was not given,\ndirectly or indirectly, to any officer or stockholder of the corporation\nowning such real property, whether as a purchase money mortgage or\notherwise, and shall also be subject to the lien of local taxes and\nassessments, without regard to when the lien for such taxes and\nassessments may have accrued. If the return is filed and the tax shown\non the report to be due is paid on or before the date on which the\nreport is required to be filed, without regard to any extensions of time\nfor filing such report, the lien shall not be enforceable against the\ninterest of any purchaser or mortgagee in property which is thereafter,\nbut prior to the issuance to the taxpayer of a notice of deficiency\nunder section seventy-two transferred to a bona fide purchaser for\nvalue, or mortgaged where the mortgage indebtedness is incurred in good\nfaith and the mortgage is not given, directly or indirectly, to any\nofficer or stockholder of the corporation. In any action to foreclose\nany such mortgage, or to foreclose the lien of local taxes or\nassessments, to which the people of the state, or the city shall have\nbeen made a party defendant by reason of the existence of a lien for any\nsuch tax, or if no such tax was due or was a lien at the time of the\ncommencement of such action and the filing of the notice of pendency\nthereof, but such a tax becomes due or becomes a lien subsequent to the\ntime of the commencement of such action and the filing of the notice of\npendency thereof, such real property shall be sold and conveyed in such\naction free from any such tax lien, and any such tax lien may become a\nlien on any surplus moneys which may result from such sale, to be\ndetermined in the proceedings for the distribution of such surplus\nmoneys. Where title to real property passes from an individual, or from\na corporation owing no tax, to another corporation which is in default\nfor such tax, the lien herein provided shall not be enforceable except\nas to any equity after the prior mortgage or purchase money mortgage\nencumbrance.(b) The director of finance may, upon application made to him and the\npayment of a fee of five dollars, release any real property from the\nlien under this subdivision, provided payment be made to the director of\nfinance of such a sum as the director of finance shall deem adequate\nconsideration for such release, or deposit be made of such security or\nsuch bond be filed as the director of finance shall deem proper to\nsecure payment of any such tax. The application for such release shall\ncontain an accurate description of the property to be released together\nwith such information as the director of finance may require. Such\nrelease may be recorded in any office in which conveyances of real\nestate are entitled to be recorded.(c) All taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest which have\nbecome a lien under this subdivision shall, after the expiration of ten\nyears from date they become due and payable, cease to be a lien (1) as\nto real estate in the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would\nbe purchasers in good faith but for such taxes, additions to tax,\npenalties or interest and (2) as to the lien on real estate of mortgages\nheld by persons who would be holders thereof in good faith but for such\ntaxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest, as against such\npurchasers or holders. The limitations herein provided for shall not\napply to any transfer from a corporation to a person or corporation with\nintent to avoid payment of any taxes, or where with like intent the\ntransfer is made to a grantee corporation, or any subsequent grantee\ncorporation, controlled by such grantor or which has any community of\ninterest with it, either through stock ownership or otherwise.§ 84. Transferees. 1. General.--The liability, at law or in equity,\nof a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax,\npenalty or interest due the director of finance under this part or under\nthe named parts, shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same\nmanner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case\nof the tax to which the liability relates, except that the period of\nlimitations for assessment against the transferee shall be extended by\none year for each successive transfer, in order, from the original\ntaxpayer to the transferee involved, but not by more than three years in\nthe aggregate. The term transferee includes, in case of successive\ntransfers, donee, heir, legatee, devisee, distributee, and successor by\nmerger, consolidation or other reorganization.2. Exceptions.--(a) If before the expiration of the period of limitations for\nassessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the\ndirector of finance in any court against the original taxpayer or the\nlast preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original\ntaxpayer, then the period of limitation for assessment of liability of\nthe transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after such\nclaim has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.(b) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision\none or the immediately preceding paragraph of this subdivision for the\nassessment of the liability, the director of finance and the transferee\nhave both consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the\nliability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the\nperiod agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by\nsubsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the\nperiod previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period\nof limitation on credit or refund to the transferee or overpayments of\ntax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the\ntransferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or\nrefund, such agreement and any extension thereof shall be deemed an\nagreement and extension thereof referred to in subdivision two of\nsection seventy-eight. If the agreement is executed after the expiration\nof the period of limitation for assessment against the original\ntaxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subdivision two of\nsection seventy-eight on the amount of the credit or refund, the periods\nspecified in subdivision one of section seventy-eight shall be increased\nby the period from the date of such expiration to the date of the\nagreement.3. Period for assessment against certain transferors.--For purposes of\nthis section, if any person is deceased or is a corporation which has\nterminated its existence, the period of limitation for assessment\nagainst such person or corporation shall be the period that would be in\neffect had death or termination of existence not occurred.4. Evidence.--The director of finance shall use his powers to make\navailable to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the transferee\nto determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding\ntransferees, but without undue hardship to the original taxpayer or\npreceding transferee. See subdivision three of section eighty for rule\nas to burden of proof.§ 85. Jeopardy assessment. 1. Authority for making.--If the director\nof finance believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency\nwill be jeopardized by delay, he shall, notwithstanding the provisions\nof section seventy-two immediately assess such deficiency (together with\nall interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for by law), and\nnotice and demand shall be made by the director of finance for the\npayment thereof.2. Notice of deficiency.--If the jeopardy assessment is made before\nany notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment\nrelates has been mailed under section seventy-two, then the director of\nfinance shall mail a notice under such section within sixty days after\nthe making of the assessment.3. Amount assessable before decision of director of finance.--The\njeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or\nless than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or\nnot the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with the director of\nfinance. The director of finance may, at any time before rendering his\ndecision, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the\nextent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The\ndirector of finance may in his decision redetermine the entire amount of\nthe deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in\nconnection therewith.4. Amounts assessable after decision of director of finance.--If the\njeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the director of\nfinance is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the\ndeficiency determined by the director of finance in his decision.5. Expiration of right to assess.--A jeopardy assessment may not be\nmade after the decision of the director of finance has become final or\nafter the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of\nthe director of finance.6. Collection of unpaid amounts.--When a petition has been filed with\nthe director of finance and when the amount which should have been\nassessed has been determined by a decision of the director of finance\nwhich has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which\nhas been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon\nnotice and demand from the director of finance, and any remaining\nportion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already\ncollected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have\nbeen assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer\nas provided in section seventy-seven without the filing of claim\ntherefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been\nassessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the\ndifference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax\nupon notice and demand from the director of finance.7. Abatement if jeopardy does not exist.--The director of finance may\nabate the jeopardy assessment if he finds that jeopardy does not exist.\nSuch abatement may not be made after a decision of the director of\nfinance in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no\npetition is filed with the director of finance, after the expiration of\nthe period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the\nmaking of assessments and levy or a proceeding for collection, in\nrespect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy\nassessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such\nperiod shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of\nsuch jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the tenth day after the\nday on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.8. Bond to stay collection.--The collection of the whole or any amount\nof any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the director of\nfinance, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an\namount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned\nupon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the\ncollection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making\nof the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of\nthe bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered\nby the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive\nsuch stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount\ncovered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the\namount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request\nof the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the\njeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under\nsection seventy-two is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount, the\nbond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.9. Petition to director of finance.--If the bond is given before the\ntaxpayer has filed its petition under section eighty, the bond shall\ncontain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the\nperiod provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of\nwhich is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any\ntime after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon\nfrom the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice\nand demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be conditioned upon\nthe payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed\nby the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the director of finance\nwhich has become final. If the director of finance determines that the\namount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been\nassessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be\nproportionately reduced when the decision of the director of finance is\nrendered.10. Stay of sale of seized property pending director's\ndecision.--Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for\nthe collection of the tax shall not be sold--(a) if subdivision two is applicable, prior to the issuance of the\nnotice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section\neighty for filing a petition with the director of finance, and(b) if a petition is filed with the director of finance (whether\nbefore or after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the\nexpiration of the period during which the assessment of the deficiency\nwould be prohibited if subdivision one were not applicable.Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if\nthe director of finance determines that the expenses of conservation and\nmaintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is\nperishable.11. Interest.--For the purpose of subdivision one of section\nseventy-five, the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined\nwithout regard to any notice and demand for payment issued under this\nsection prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.12. Early termination of taxable year.--If the director of finance\nfinds that a taxpayer designs quickly to remove its property from this\nstate, or to conceal its property therein, or to do any other act\ntending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual\nproceedings to collect the tax for the current or the preceding taxable\nyear unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the director of\nfinance shall declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately\nterminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be\ngiven the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of the\ntax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for the\npreceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or\nnot the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying the\ntax has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due\nand payable. If any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made\ndue and payable by virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the\nfinding of the director of finance made as herein provided, whether made\nafter notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes\npresumptive evidence of jeopardy.13.

No\nunderpayment shall be deemed to exist with respect to a declaration or\ninstallment otherwise due on or after the taxpayer's death. In any case\nin which there would be no underpayment if this subdivision were applied\nby substituting \"eighty percent\" for \"ninety percent\" where it appears\nin the second preceding sentence, the addition to tax under this\nsubdivision shall be equal to seventy-five percent of the amount\notherwise determined under this subdivision.(d) Exception to addition for underpayment of estimated tax.--The\naddition to tax under subdivision (c) with respect to any underpayment\nof any installment shall not be imposed of the total amount of all\npayments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for\nthe payment of such installment equals or exceeds whichever of the\nfollowing is the lesser--(1) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before\nsuch date if the estimated tax were whichever of the following is the\nleast--(A) The tax shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding\ntaxable year, if a return showing a liability for tax was filed by the\ntaxpayer for the preceding taxable year and such preceding year was a\ntaxable year of twelve months, or(B) An amount equal to the tax computed, at the rates applicable to\nthe taxable year, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on his\nreturn for, and the law applicable to, the preceding taxable year, or(C) An amount equal to ninety per cent of the tax for the taxable year\ncomputed by placing on an annualized basis the unincorporated business\ntaxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the\nmonth in which the installment is required to be paid.

The commissioner of finance may by regulations provide for the\ndetermination of the base period percentage in the case of new\nunincorporated businesses and other similar circumstances, and(II) the term \"filing month\" means the month in which the installment\nis required to be paid; or(2) An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax computed, at the\nrates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the actual\nunincorporated business taxable income for the months in the taxable\nyear ending before the month in which the installment is required to be\npaid.(e) Allocation of unincorporated business tax.--(1) Except as provided\nin paragraph two hereof, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph one of\nsubdivision (d) of this section shall not apply in the case of any\ntaxpayer which had unincorporated business taxable income, or the\nportion thereof allocated within the city, of one million dollars or\nmore for any taxable year during the three taxable years immediately\npreceding the taxable year involved.(2) The amount treated as the estimated tax under subparagraphs (A)\nand (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this section shall in no\nevent be less than seventy-five percent of the tax shown on the return\nfor the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-three or, if\nno return was filed, seventy-five percent of the tax for such year.(f) Deficiency due to fraud.--If any part of a deficiency is due to\nfraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty per cent\nof the deficiency.

For purposes of this\nsubdivision, there is a substantial understatement of tax for any\ntaxable year if the amount of the understatement for the taxable year\nexceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on\nthe return for the taxable year, or five thousand dollars. For purposes\nof the preceding sentence, the term \"understatement\" means the excess of\nthe amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable\nyear, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return.\nThe amount of the understatement under the preceding sentence shall be\nreduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to\nthe tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was\nsubstantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to\nwhich the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are\nadequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the\nreturn.

The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed\nthe portion of the tax paid after the execution of the agreement and\nbefore the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as\nthe case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period\nwhich would be applicable under subdivision (a) if a claim had been\nfiled on the date the agreement was executed.(c) Notice of change or correction of federal taxable income.--If a\ntaxpayer is required by section one hundred twenty-seven to report a\nchange or correction in federal taxable income reported on his federal\nincome tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated\nin the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax\npurposes, or to file an amended return with the director of finance,\nclaim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be\nfiled by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such\nchange or correction or such amended return was required to be filed\nwith the director of finance.

The amount of such\ncredit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax\nattributable to such federal change, correction or items amended on the\ntaxpayer's amended federal income tax return. This subdivision shall\nnot affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for\ncredit or refund my be filed apart from this subdivision.(d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback.--A claim\nfor credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to\nthe application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall\nbe filed within three years from the time the return was due for the\ntaxable year of the loss, or within the period prescribed in subdivision\n(b) in respect of such taxable year, or within the period prescribed in\nsubdivision (c), where applicable, in respect of the taxable year to\nwhich the net operating loss is carried back, whichever expires the\nlatest.(e) Failure to file claim within prescribed period.--No credit or\nrefund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision (f)\nof this section or subdivision (d) of section one hundred thirty-eight\nafter the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in\nthis title unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer\nwithin such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later refund\nerroneous.

If the\nreport or amended return required by section one hundred twenty-seven-A\nis not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, interest on\nany resulting refund or credit shall cease to accrue after such\nninetieth day. The amount of such credit or refund shall be computed\nwithout change of the allocation of income or capital upon which the\ntaxpayer's return (or any additional assessment) was based, and shall\nnot exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such\nchange or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability. This\nsubdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for\nwhich a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this\nsubdivision.§ 136. Interest on overpayment.

The period so agreed upon may be extended by\nsubsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the\nperiod previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period\nof limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of\ntax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the\ntransferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or\nrefund, such agreement and any extension thereof shall be deemed an\nagreement and extension thereof referred to in subdivision (b) of\nsection one hundred thirty-five. If the agreement is executed after the\nexpiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the\noriginal taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subdivision\n(b) of section one hundred thirty-five on the amount of the credit or\nrefund, the periods specified in subdivision (a) of section one hundred\nthirty-five shall be increased by the period from the date of such\nexpiration to the date of the agreement.(c) Deceased transferor.--If any person is deceased, the period of\nlimitation for assessment against him shall be the period that would be\nin effect if he had lived.(d) Evidence.--Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (e) of\nsection one hundred forty-five the director of finance shall use his\npowers to make available to the transferee evidence necessary to enable\nthe transferee to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and\nof any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship to the original\ntaxpayer or preceding transferee.

The director of finance may, at any time before rendering his\ndecision, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the\nextent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The\ndirector of finance may in his decision redetermine the entire amount of\nthe deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in\nconnection therewith.(d) Amount assessable after decision of director of finance.--If the\njeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the director of\nfinance is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the\ndeficiency determined by the director of finance in his decision.(e) Expiration of right to assess.--A jeopardy assessment may not be\nmade after the decision of the director of finance has become final or\nafter the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of\nthe director of finance.(f) Collection of unpaid amounts.--When a petition has been filed with\nthe director of finance and when the amount which should have been\nassessed has been determined by a decision of the director of finance\nwhich has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which\nhas been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon\nnotice and demand from the director of finance, and any remaining\nportion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already\ncollected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have\nbeen assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer\nas provided in section one hundred thirty-four without the filing of\nclaim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have\nbeen assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the\ndifference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax\nupon notice and demand from the director of finance.(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist.--The director of finance may\nabate the jeopardy assessment if he finds that jeopardy does not exist.\nSuch abatement may not be made after a decision of the director of\nfinance in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no\npetition is filed with the director of finance, after the expiration of\nthe period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the\nmaking of assessments and levy or a proceeding for collection, in\nrespect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy\nassessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such\nperiod shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of\nsuch jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the tenth day after the\nday on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.(h) Bond to stay collection.--The collection of the whole or any\namount of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the\ndirector of finance, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a\nbond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired,\nconditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest\nthereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for\nthe making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon\nthe filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed\nas is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the\nright to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part\nof the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any\npart of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at\nthe request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion\nof the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under\nsection one hundred twenty-nine is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser\namount, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be\nproportionately reduced.(i) Petition to director of finance.--If the bond is given before the\ntaxpayer has filed his petition under section one hundred thirty-seven,\nthe bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not\nfiled within the period provided in such section, then the amount, the\ncollection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and\ndemand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with\ninterest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the\ndate of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be\nconditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection\nof which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the\ndirector of finance which has become final. If the director of finance\ndetermines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which\nshould have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the\ntaxpayer, be proportionately reduced when the decision of the director\nof finance is rendered.(j) Stay of sale of seized property pending director of finance\ndecision.--Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for\nthe collection of the tax shall not be sold--(1) if subdivision (b) is applicable, pior to the issuance of the\nnotice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section\none hundred thirty-seven for filing a petition with the director of\nfinance, and(2) if a petition is filed with the director of finance (whether\nbefore or after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the\nexpiration of the period during which the assessment of the deficiency\nwould be prohibited if subdivision (a) were not applicable.Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if\nthe director of finance determines that the expenses of conservation and\nmaintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is\nperishable.(k) Interest.--For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section one\nhundred thirty-two, the last date prescribed for payment shall be\ndetermined without regard to any notice and demand for payment issued\nunder this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such\npayment.(l) Early termination of taxable year.--If the director of finance\nfinds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to\nremove his property therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property\ntherein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly\nor partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the income tax for the\ncurrent or the preceeding taxable year unless such proceedings be\nbrought without delay, the director of finance shall declare the taxable\nperiod for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice\nof such finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer, together with\na demand for immediate payment of the tax for the taxable period so\ndeclared terminated and of the tax for the preceeding taxable year or so\nmuch of such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed\nby law for filing return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes\nshall thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding\nbrought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of\nthe provisions of this subdivision, the finding of the director of\nfinance made as herein provided, whether made after notice to the\ntaxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of\njeopardy.(m) Reopening of taxable period.--Notwithstanding the termination of\nthe taxable period of the taxpayer by the director of finance as\nprovided in subdivision (l), the director of finance may reopen such\ntaxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the director of\nfinance to have received income, within the current taxable year, since\nthe termination of such period.
