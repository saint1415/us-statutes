      "text": "findings.The Legislature finds that DNA data banks are an important tool in criminal investigations, in the exclusion of individuals who are the subject of criminal investigations or prosecutions, in deterring and detecting recidivist acts, and in locating and identifying missing persons and human remains. Several states have enacted laws requiring persons convicted of certain crimes to provide genetic samples for DNA typing tests. Moreover, it is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations and in locating and identifying missing persons and human remains. It is in the best interest of this state to establish a State DNA Database for DNA records and a State DNA Sample Bank as a repository for DNA samples from individuals convicted of felony offenses and other specified offenses and from individuals for purposes of assisting in locating and identifying missing persons and human remains.SourceLaws 1997, LB 278, § 2;Laws 2006, LB 385, § 3;Laws 2006, LB 1113, § 29;Laws 2010, LB190, § 3.",
