Because decisions\nconcerning safety at automated teller machines are inherently subjective, the\nGeneral Assembly establishes as the standard of care applicable to owners or\noperators of automated teller machines and persons who control access areas or\ndefined parking areas in connection with user safety, substantial compliance\nwith Section 10 and, if the owners or operators or persons who control access\nareas or defined parking areas are also issuers of access devices, substantial\ncompliance, in addition, with Section 15 of this Act. The General Assembly\nestablishes as the standard of care applicable to issuers of access devices\nsubstantial compliance with Section 15 of this Act. It is not the intent of\nthe General Assembly in enacting this Act to impose a duty to relocate or\nmodify automated teller machines upon the occurrence of a particular event or\ncircumstance. Substantial compliance with Section 10 of this Act shall\nconstitute prima facie evidence that an owner or operator of an automated\nteller machine, and a person who controls an access area or defined parking\narea, has provided adequate and reasonable measures for the safety of\ncustomers. Substantial compliance with Section 15 of this Act shall constitute\nprima facie evidence that an issuer of an access device has provided adequate\nand reasonable measures for the safety of customers.",
