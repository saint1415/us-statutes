Services should be provided in a way which is normalizing as well as respectful of the rights, feelings, and responsibilities of each person with a disability. Services should also focus on enabling individuals to maintain responsibility for setting their own goals, directing their own lives, and acting responsibly as members of their community. Persons who have disabilities shall not be deprived of any right, benefit, or privilege guaranteed by law, the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or the Constitution of the United States without due process of law.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-690, p. 1502, §2.)",
