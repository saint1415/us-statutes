Neither a contributor nor the contributor’s spouse shall serve as co-trustee.\n\n(5) During his or her lifetime, any contributor or contributor’s spouse who has not been designated as the life beneficiary, may revoke his or her contribution made to the AFT Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any contributor may, at any time, voluntarily waive the right to revoke by written notice. If the life beneficiary has not received any benefits provided by the use of the AFT Trust income or principal at the time the contributor revokes the contribution to the AFT Trust, then, subject to the payment of any administrative fees and expenses as established by the AFT Corporation, an amount equal to the current fair market value of the balance of the life beneficiary’s account in the AFT Trust as determined on the date of distribution shall be returned to the contributor. If at the time a contributor revokes the contribution to the AFT Trust the life beneficiary has received any benefits provided by the use of the AFT Trust income or principal, then, subject to the payment of any administrative fees and expenses as established by the AFT Corporation, an amount equal to 95 percent of the current fair market value of the principal balance of the life beneficiary account in the AFT Trust as determined on the date of distribution shall be returned to the contributor.

Any net income which is not used shall be added annually to the principal.\n\n(7) In the event that the trustee and the co-trustee shall be unable to agree either on the amount of income or principal, or income and principal, to be used or the benefits to be provided, then either the trustee or the co-trustee may request that the matter be resolved by arbitration. The requesting party shall send a written request for arbitration to the responding party and shall in the request set forth the name, address, and telephone number of the requesting party’s arbitrator. The responding party shall, within 10 days, after receipt of the request for arbitration, set forth in writing to the requesting party the name, address, and telephone number of the responding party’s arbitrator. Copies of the request for arbitration and response shall be sent to the commissioner of the department. If the two designated arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator within 10 days after the responding party has identified the responding party’s arbitrator, then the commissioner shall designate the third arbitrator by written notice to the requesting and responding parties’ arbitrators. The three arbitrators shall meet and render a decision within 30 calendar days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. A decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the requesting and responding parties. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of the party’s arbitrator and the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties.\n\n(8) If a settlor designates a contributor or the contributor’s spouse as the life beneficiary and the trustee terminates the individual trust agreement for any lawful reason other than the death of the life beneficiary, the amounts remaining in the life beneficiary’s account upon the termination shall be disbursed as follows:\n\na. Payment of reasonable fees for administration of the trust, such as an accounting of the trust to a court, completion and filing of documents, or other required actions associated with termination and wrapping up of the trust.\n\nb. Reimbursement to the State of Alabama, or to any other state, the District of Columbia, or any other commonwealth, territory, or jurisdiction of the United States, for medical assistance paid on behalf of the life beneficiary under the plan of the respective jurisdiction.\n\nc.

The income attributable to the AFT Charitable Trust shall be used for the benefit of beneficiaries of AFT individual trusts who have needs that cannot be met from funds available to such life beneficiaries from their AFT individual trusts. The board of trustees shall determine annually the amount of AFT Charitable Trust income to be used to provide benefits and the nature and type of benefits to be provided for each AFT life beneficiary while taking into account the individual’s eligibility for government benefits. Any income of the AFT Charitable Trust not used shall be added annually to the principal.\n\n(2) The board of trustees shall accept contributions to the AFT Charitable Trust from any source and shall comply with all rules and regulations under the United States Internal Revenue Code that govern the acceptance of charitable contributions.\n\n(Acts 1994, No. 94-579, p. 1054, §5; Acts 1996, No. 96-559, p. 831, §1; Act 2000-141, p. 194, §1; Act 2006-604, p. 1658, §1; Act 2013-366, p. 1313, §1; Act 2018-36, §1.)",
