The states may conduct a nationwide criminal history background check for the purpose of determining whether an individual who shall have unsupervised access to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities has been convicted of a crime that bears upon the fitness of the individual to provide care to or have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities as defined in this chapter. The Legislature finds that there is an important state interest and it is in the best interest of the children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities of Alabama to protect them from those persons who may inflict physical or mental injury or abuse, sexual abuse or exploitation, or maltreatment or other mistreatment upon children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the implementation of a system that allows the Department of Human Resources, licensed child placing agencies, and child and adult care facilities to ensure that current licensees, license and volunteer applicants, prospective employees, current employees, and volunteers are suitable for employment, to perform volunteer work, or to hold a license, permit, approval, or certification and have not been convicted of a crime that bears upon their fitness to provide care or have responsibility for the safety or well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities as defined in this chapter.\n\n(Act 2000-775, p. 1775, §1.)",

The statement shall include a notice and questionnaire the same as or similar to the following:\n\n(1) MANDATORY CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK NOTICE: Alabama law requires that a criminal history background information check be conducted on all persons who hold a license or work in a Department of Human Resources licensed child care or adult care facility, a foster or adoptive home approved by the Department of Human Resources, or a licensed child placing agency, including all officers and agents of the entity. You are required to provide full, complete, and accurate information on your criminal conviction history upon application for a license or employment.

Unless a criminal history background information check report and suitability determination have previously been obtained, you must complete a written request and consent for a criminal history background information check with fingerprints at the time of application for employment. Refusal to complete these documents or providing false information may result in refusal of employment, approval, or licensure. The term conviction includes a determination of guilt by a trial, by a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere. You are required to notify your employer, licensing agency, or entity where you are performing volunteer work of any criminal conviction occurring subsequent to the date of completion of this notice. Any individual determined to have submitted false information may be referred to the district attorney or law enforcement for investigation and possible prosecution.

Upon receipt of a signed criminal history statement which does not indicate conviction for a crime prohibiting employment under the suitability criteria, an employer, including the Department of Human Resources, may employ an applicant or allow a volunteer or contract provider to work provisionally pending receipt of a suitability determination from the Department of Human Resources.\n\n(c) No later than the five business days after employment or a reasonable time after completion of application for a license or approval, an employer, the Department of Human Resources, or child placing agency shall mail or deliver a request for a criminal history background information check to the Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency accompanied by all of the following:\n\n(1) Two complete sets of fingerprints, properly executed by a law enforcement agency or an individual properly trained in fingerprinting techniques.\n\n(2) Written consent from the applicant, employee, or volunteer for the release of the criminal history background information to the Department of Human Resources.\n\n(3) The fee.\n\n(d) Upon receipt of a suitability determination from the Department of Human Resources that a person or entity is suitable for employment, volunteer work, licensure, or approval based on the criminal history background information check, an employer, a child care facility, adult care facility, a child placing agency, or the Department of Human Resources may make its own determination of employment, licensure, or approval. This chapter shall not create any right to employment, work, approval, or licensure. Upon receipt of a determination from the Department of Human Resources that an individual is unsuitable for employment, licensure, approval, or volunteer work, an employer, the child care facility, adult care facility, child placing agency, or Department of Human Resources shall terminate the individual from employment or volunteer work or shall not employ or use the individual. Termination of employment may be delayed by the employer to allow the individual to challenge either the accuracy or completeness of the criminal history information background report or the suitability determination made by the Department of Human Resources. The Department of Human Resources or child placing agency shall suspend or revoke a license or approval or deny a license or approval application to an individual receiving an unsuitability determination. As an alternative to termination of employment, the Department of Human Resources may transfer a permanent Merit System employee to an available position for which the employee is qualified where unsupervised access to children, the elderly, or persons with disabilities shall not be an essential function of the job.\n\n(e) If a review of a criminal history background information check or other information received reveals that the person has submitted false information, the employer, child care facility, adult care facility, child placing agency, or Department of Human Resources may terminate the employee or volunteer. The Department of Human Resources or child placing agency may revoke the approval or license of a person or entity when the person or entity submits false information in a review of criminal history background information check or other information. The Department of Human Resources shall be notified of the false information and may refer the case to an appropriate law enforcement agency or district attorney for investigation and prosecution.\n\n(f) Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, only one criminal history background information check shall be required on an individual regardless of subsequent changes in employment or licensing or approval status. Subsequent criminal history background information checks may be conducted by the employer or licensing or approval entity. The licensing or approval entity shall pay the cost for subsequent criminal history background information checks. If the statement signed by the applicant or employee states that a criminal history background information check has been performed and suitability determination issued on the individual pursuant to this chapter, the employer or licensing agency may request at the time of application only a suitability determination from the Department of Human Resources on the check previously performed, within five business days of employment, or completion of license or approval application, submitting the same kind of information and consent for the request for suitability determination as required by the written consent for a criminal history background information check.\n\n(Act 2000-775, p. 1775, §4; Act 2012-55, p. 92, §1; Act 2015-463, p. 1506, §1; Act 2019-322, §1.)",

The Department of Public Safety shall notify the Department of Human Resources of arrests or convictions entered into the automated system subsequent to the initial report, for a crime committed by an individual for whom a criminal history background information report has been previously requested, regardless of the existence, or lack thereof, of a criminal history at the time of submission for a criminal history background information check pursuant to this chapter. The Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center shall notify the Department of Public Safety which shall notify the Department of Human Resources of the arrest or conviction information for applicants that receive name-based criminal history background information checks. The Department of Human Resources shall include the arrests or convictions in an amended or subsequent suitability determination.\n\n(c) A person may contest the accuracy or completeness of the Alabama criminal history background information check pertaining to him or her with the Department of Public Safety according to procedures established by that agency. The person or his or her legal counsel may review at the Department of Human Resources a copy of the Alabama criminal history background information report from the Department of Public Safety. If, upon review by the Department of Public Safety, the information is determined to be incorrect or incomplete, the information shall be corrected appropriately, and the Department of Human Resources shall be provided with the corrected information.\n\n(d) The Department of Human Resources shall issue a suitability determination and maintain a confidential file on individuals for whom a criminal history background information report or report updates have been received. The Department of Human Resources may issue a suitability determination based upon the criminal history report on file without the requirement of a new criminal history background information check. If no report or if only an incomplete criminal history report can be located in the files of the Department of Human Resources, the individual shall be required to submit to a new criminal history background information check.\n\n(e) Within 30 days of the date of notification, an individual determined to be unsuitable for approval, licensure, employment, or volunteer work by the Department of Human Resources based upon a disqualifying conviction may request in writing reversal of the determination of unsuitability if the conviction is not for a sex crime or a crime committed against a child, an elderly individual, or an individual with disabilities. An individual with a conviction excluded by federal law from being approved as a foster or adoptive parent, as any other child care or adult care provider, or volunteer may not be considered for reinstatement.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding subsection (e), the following shall apply to requests for reversal of the determination of unsuitability:\n\nIn the case of a felony conviction, 10 years shall have lapsed since the sentence was served or the probation or parole ended, whichever is later, with no subsequent conviction. In the case of a misdemeanor conviction, five years shall have lapsed since the sentence was served, or the probation or parole ended, whichever is later, with no subsequent conviction. In addition to the foregoing, the individual shall affirmatively demonstrate to the Department of Human Resources successful rehabilitation by clear and convincing evidence. In determining whether an individual has affirmatively demonstrated successful rehabilitation, all of the following shall be considered:\n\n(1) Nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted person would hold or has held.\n\n(2) Nature and seriousness of the offense committed.\n\n(3) Circumstances under which the offense occurred.\n\n(4) Date of the offense.\n\n(5) Age of the person when the offense was committed.\n\n(6) Whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident.\n\n(7) Social conditions which may have contributed to the offense.\n\n(8) An available probation or parole record, report, or recommendation.\n\n(9) Evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful business or employment history, and the recommendation of his or her supervisors.\n\n(g) The Department of Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety may adopt rules and regulations to implement the procedures and requirements of this chapter pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 41-22-1, et seq.\n\n(Act 2000-775, p. 1775, §7; Act 2012-55, p. 92, §1.)",
