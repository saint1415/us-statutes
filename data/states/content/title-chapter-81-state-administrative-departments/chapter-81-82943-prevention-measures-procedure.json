      "text": "measures; procedure.(1) In addition to prevention measures included in the state, city, village, county, and interjurisdictional emergency operations plans, the Governor shall consider on a continuing basis steps that could be taken to prevent or reduce the harmful consequences of disasters, emergencies, and civil defense emergencies. At his or her direction and pursuant to any other authority and competence they have, state agencies, including, but not limited to, those charged with responsibilities in connection with flood plain management, stream encroachment and flow regulation, fire prevention and control, air quality, public works, land use and land-use planning, and construction standards, shall make studies of prevention-related matters. The Governor, from time to time, shall make such recommendations to the Legislature, local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities as may facilitate measures for prevention or mitigation of the harmful consequences of disasters, emergencies, and civil defense emergencies. The recommendations submitted to the Legislature shall be submitted electronically.(2) The appropriate state agencies, in conjunction with the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, shall keep land uses and construction of structures and other facilities under continuing study and identify areas which are particularly susceptible to severe land shifting, subsidence, flood, or other catastrophic occurrence. The studies under this subsection shall concentrate on means of mitigating or avoiding the dangers caused by any such occurrence or the consequences thereof.(3) If the agency believes on the basis of the studies or other competent evidence that an area is susceptible to a disaster, emergency, or civil defense emergency of catastrophic proportions without adequate warning, that existing building standards and land-use controls in that area are inadequate and could add substantially to the magnitude thereof, and that changes in zoning regulations, other land-use regulations, or building requirements are essential in order to further the purposes of this section, it shall specify the essential changes to the Governor. If the Governor upon review of the recommendation finds after public hearing that the changes are essential, he or she shall so recommend to the agencies or local governments with jurisdiction over the area and subject matter. If no action or insufficient action pursuant to his or her recommendations is taken within the time specified by the Governor, he or she shall so inform the Legislature electronically and request appropriate legislative action to mitigate the impact of a disaster, emergency, or civil defense emergency.(4) The Governor, at the same time that he or she makes recommendations pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, may suspend the standard or control which he or she finds to be inadequate to protect the public safety and by regulation place a new standard or control in effect. The new standard or control shall remain in effect until rejected by resolution of the Legislature or amended by the Governor. During the time it is in effect, the standard or control contained in the Governor's regulation shall be administered and given full effect by all relevant regulatory agencies of the state and local governments to which it applies. The Governor's action shall be subject to judicial review but shall not be subject to temporary stay pending litigation.SourceLaws 1973, LB 494, § 8;Laws 1988, LB 352, § 168;Laws 1996, LB 43, § 24;Laws 1996, LB 966, § 1;Laws 2012, LB782, § 170.",
