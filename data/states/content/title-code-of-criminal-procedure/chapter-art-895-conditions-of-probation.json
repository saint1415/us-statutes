All costs shall be paid by the defendant. If the court finds that there are no adult education or reading programs in the parish in which the defendant is domiciled, the defendant is unable to afford such a program, or attendance would create an undue hardship on the defendant, the court may suspend this condition of probation.

The defendant shall be given a certificate setting forth the conditions of his probation and shall be required to agree in writing to the conditions.K. In cases where the defendant has been convicted of an offense involving criminal sexual activity, the court shall order as a condition of probation that the defendant successfully complete a sex offender treatment program.

If the defendant has already completed such a counseling program, said counseling requirement shall be required only upon a finding by the court that such counseling or therapy would be effective in preventing future domestic abuse or dating violence.(2) All costs for the counseling or therapy shall be paid by the offender. In addition, the court may order that the defendant pay an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars to a family violence program located in the parish where the offense of domestic abuse occurred.N. If a defendant is injured or suffers other loss in the performance of community service work required as a condition of probation, neither the state nor any political subdivision, nor any officer, agent, or employee of the state or political subdivision shall be liable for any such injury or loss, unless the injury or loss was caused by the gross negligence or intentional acts of the officer, agent, or employee of the state or political subdivision.

Such technology may also be used for required reporting or meetings of a defendant on probation who is self-employed at the discretion of the defendant's probation officer and in accordance with any rules promulgated by the Department of Public Safety and Corrections pursuant to this Paragraph.(3) The Department of Public Safety and Corrections shall promulgate rules in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act to implement the provisions of this Paragraph.
