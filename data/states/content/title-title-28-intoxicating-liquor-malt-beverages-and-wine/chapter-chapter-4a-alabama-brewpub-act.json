Every brewpub licensee shall file the tax returns, pay the taxes, and perform all obligations imposed on wholesalers at the times and places set forth therein. It shall be unlawful for any brewpub licensee who is required to pay the taxes so imposed in the first instance to fail or refuse to add to the sales price and collect from the purchaser the required amount of tax, it being the intent and purpose of this provision that each of the taxes levied is in fact a tax on the consumer, with the brewpub licensee who pays the tax in the first instance acting merely as an agent of the state for the collection and payment of the tax levied by Section 28-3-184 and as an agent of the county or municipality for the collection and payment of the tax levied by Section 28-3-190. Taxes on beer shall be levied at the time the beer is allocated for the purpose of retail sale and not at the time the beer is dispensed for consumption.\n\n(b) The brewpub shall be required to keep and maintain all of the records otherwise required to be kept and maintained by manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer licensees.\n\n(c) The brewpub shall appoint a licensed wholesaler designee in order to preserve Section 28-9-1. In addition, for on-premises sales of beer brewed by the brewpub licensee, the brewpub shall be exempt from Sections 28-9-3 through 28-9-11.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-535, p. 1078, §4; Act 2011-630, p. 1488, §2; Act 2019-400, §2.)",

The Legislature finds that an effective way of facilitating the urban redevelopment program and the preservation of historic buildings and sites, and registered historic districts and any economically distressed area designated as suitable by the municipal or county governing body is by creating a single exception to the existing alcoholic beverage laws to authorize and permit the establishment of brewpubs located in such historic buildings, sites, or districts in urban redevelopment areas or economically distressed areas of those municipalities located within counties where the brewing of beer for consumption by the public had historically been located. The policy and intent of the Legislature in the enactment of this chapter is to promote the public welfare by further regulating and controlling alcoholic beverage transactions in Alabama under the control and supervision of the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to accomplish this legislative purpose set forth herein.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-535, p. 1078, §6; Act 2011-630, p. 1488, §2.)",
