      "text": "Section 28-2A-1\n\nProcedure for Wet or Dry Classification Option Elections.\n\n(a) Any municipality having a population of 1,000 or more, may change its classification from dry to wet or wet to dry by a municipal option election, in the following manner.\n\n(b) Upon petition of 30 percent of the number of voters voting in the last preceding general election of the municipality being filed with the city or town clerk or governing body of the municipality, the governing body must call a municipal option election for the municipality to determine the sentiment of the people as to whether or not alcoholic beverages can be legally sold or distributed in the municipality. The petition for municipal option election shall contain the following: “It is petitioned that a municipal option election be held to permit the legal sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages within this municipality.” On the ballot to be used for such municipal option election, the question shall be in the following form: “Do you favor the legal sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages within this municipality? Yes _____ No _____.” Each subsequent municipal option election must follow the petition process as provided in this subsection with a new petition.\n\n(c) The municipal option election shall be held and the officers appointed to hold same in the manner provided by law for holding other municipal elections and the returns thereof tabulated and the results certified as provided by law for such municipal elections. The municipal option election shall be held at the time of the primary, general, county-wide, or municipal election next succeeding the date of the filing of the petition, provided, however, the election shall not be held within less than 30 days from the date of the filing of the petition. Notice of the municipal option election shall be given by the governing body of the municipality by publication at least three weeks before the date of election, in a newspaper in the municipality, or, if there be none, in a newspaper in the county, or, if there be neither, by posting such notice at the town or city hall, apprising the voters of the municipality that a municipal option election shall be held to determine whether such municipality shall be wet or dry under this article. The cost of the municipal option election, including the cost of notice by publication, shall be paid out of the general fund of the municipality.\n\n(d) Only qualified voters shall vote in the municipal option election. If a majority of the voters in the municipal option election vote “yes,” the municipality shall be wet, and alcoholic beverages can be legally sold, distributed and consumed within the corporate limits of the municipality, and all of the provisions of this title, relating to alcoholic beverages in wet counties, including Chapters 3, 3A, 6, and 7, shall be immediately put into operation with respect to and effective within the corporate limits of the municipality. The municipality shall remain wet until the municipality shall be in subsequent municipal option election held under this article changed to a dry municipality, notwithstanding the results of any subsequent county election or special method referendum. All other laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the electors residing within the corporate limits of any such municipality that has become wet pursuant to a municipal option election held under this article shall not be entitled to vote in any subsequent county election or special method referendum held to determine if the county in which such municipality is located shall become wet. The question of whether such county shall become wet shall be decided by the electors of such county residing outside the corporate limits of such wet municipality as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(e) If a majority of the voters voting in the municipal option election vote “no,” the municipality shall be a dry municipality under the terms of this article until the county shall by subsequent election or special referendum, vote wet, or the municipality shall by a subsequent municipal option election held under this article, vote wet.\n\n(f) The municipal option election in the municipality may be held at the time of any primary, general, county-wide, or municipal election as determined by the county commission or the municipal governing body, as applicable, provided a period of not less than 720 days must elapse between the dates of such municipal option elections; provided further, that a county wet-dry election or special method referendum may be held at any time without regard to the lapse of time between the dates of any county option elections.\n\n(Acts 1984, No. 84-408, p. 955, §1; Act 2009-546, p. 1446, §1; Act 2015-2, §1.)",

In the furtherance of the protection of the public welfare, health, peace, and morals, the Legislature has determined that a population classification should be established to provide this method of municipal option election only in those municipalities with a population of 1,000 or more people within a county, it being the judgment of the Legislature that municipalities with a lesser population would be unable to support and maintain such protection where such municipality is located in a dry county, whereas a municipality of 1,000 or more population would have the resources and ability to support and maintain such safeguards.\n\n(Acts 1984, No. 84-408, p. 955, §3; Act 2009-546, p. 1446, §1; Act 2015-2, §1.)",

If the governing body of the municipality adopts an ordinance determining that all of the area within the corporate limits of the municipality should be legally wet, and if this decision is approved at a subsequent referendum called to decide this issue, alcoholic beverages may be lawfully sold, distributed, and consumed within the newly annexed portions of corporate limits of the municipality. If a municipality adopts such an ordinance, and if the results of the subsequent referendum are in favor of making the annexed portions of the municipality wet as evidenced by a majority of the electors of the municipality voting in the referendum voting in favor of the proposition, all of the provisions of this title, relating to alcoholic beverages in wet counties, including Chapters 3, 3A, 6, and 7, shall be immediately put into operation with respect to and effective throughout the corporate limits of the municipality. If, however, after the passage of an ordinance, the called referendum shall fail, the annexed portions of the municipality shall remain legally dry, but the vote shall not affect the wet status of those portions of the municipality which were legally wet before the referendum was conducted.\n\n(Act 2003-277, p. 668, §1.)",
