Any agreement which is in existence on March 3, 1988, shall be renewed consistent with this chapter; provided, that this chapter may be incorporated by reference in the agreement. Provided, however, nothing contained herein shall prevent a supplier from appointing, one time for a period not to exceed 90 days, a wholesaler to temporarily service a sales territory not designated to another wholesaler, until such time as a wholesaler is appointed by the supplier; and such wholesaler who is designated to service the sales territory during this period of temporary service shall not be in violation of the chapter, and, with respect to the temporary service territory, shall not have any of the rights provided under Sections 28-9-6 and 28-9-8.\n\n(2) Fix, maintain, or establish the price at which a wholesaler shall sell any beer.\n\n(3) Enter into an additional agreement with any other wholesaler for, or to sell to any other wholesaler, the same brand or brands of beer in the same territory or any portion thereof, or to sell directly to any retailer in this state.\n\n(4) Coerce, or attempt to coerce, any wholesaler to accept delivery of any beer, or other commodity which has not been ordered by the wholesaler.

Provided, however, a wholesaler that has agreed to distribute a brand or brands before March 3, 1988, shall continue to distribute the brand or brands in conformance with this chapter.\n\n(9) Request a wholesaler to submit audited profit and loss statements, balance sheets, or financial records as a condition of renewal or continuation of an agreement.\n\n(10) Withhold delivery of beer ordered by a wholesaler, or change a wholesaler’s quota of a brand or brands if the withholding or change is not made in good faith.\n\n(11) Require a wholesaler by any means directly to participate in or contribute to any local or national advertising fund controlled directly or indirectly by a supplier.\n\n(12) Take any retaliatory action against a wholesaler that files a complaint regarding an alleged violation by the supplier of federal, state or local law or an administrative rule.\n\n(13) Require or prohibit, without just and reasonable cause, any change in the manager or successor manager of any wholesaler who has been approved by the supplier as of or subsequent to March 3, 1988.

If a wholesaler engages in conduct prohibited under this chapter, a supplier with which the wholesaler has an agreement may maintain a civil action against the wholesaler to recover actual damages reasonably incurred as the result of the prohibited conduct.\n\n(b) A supplier that violates any provision of this chapter shall be liable for all actual damages and all court costs and, in the court’s discretion, reasonable attorney fees incurred by a wholesaler as a result of that violation. A wholesaler that violates any provision of this chapter shall be liable for all actual damages and all court costs and, in the court’s discretion, reasonable attorney fees incurred by the supplier as a result of that violation.\n\n(c) This chapter imposes upon a supplier the duty to deal fairly and in good faith with a wholesaler which has entered into an agreement with the supplier to purchase and sell a brand or brands of beer sold by the supplier. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, if a court finds that a supplier has intentionally, consciously or deliberately acted or failed to act which was not in good faith or was in bad faith either in (1) effecting an amendment, modification, termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of any agreement; or (2) unreasonably interfering with, preventing or unreasonably delaying the transfer of the wholesaler’s business where approval of the proposed transferee is not required by this chapter; or (3) unreasonably withholding its consent to or approval of any assignment, transfer, or sale of a wholesaler’s business, where approval of the proposed transferee is required by this chapter; it may, upon proof thereof by clear and convincing evidence as defined in Section 6-11-20, award exemplary or punitive damages, as well as actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees to the wholesaler who has been damaged by the action or failure to act of the supplier. Such actions or failure to act on the part of the supplier shall constitute the tort of bad faith, and the amount of any award of punitive damages and the review thereof by the trial or appellate court shall be governed by the provisions of Section 6-11-25.\n\n(d) A supplier or wholesaler may bring an action for declaratory judgment for determination of any controversy arising pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(e) Upon proper application to the court, a supplier or wholesaler may obtain injunctive relief against any violation of this chapter. If the court grants injunctive relief or issues a temporary restraining order, bond shall not be required to be posted.\n\n(f) The remedies provided by this section are nonexclusive, and nothing contained herein shall abolish any cause of action or remedy available to the supplier or the wholesaler existing on March 3, 1988.\n\n(g) Any legal action taken under this chapter, or in a dispute arising out of an agreement or breach thereof, or over the provisions of an agreement shall be filed in a court, state or federal, located in Alabama, which state court is located in, or which federal court has jurisdiction and venue of, the county in which the wholesaler maintains its principal place of business in this state.\n\n(Acts 1988, No. 88-80, p. 87, §11.)",
