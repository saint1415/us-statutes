It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to pay the tax in the first instance to fail or refuse to add to the sales price and collect from the purchaser the required amount of tax, it being the intent and purpose of this provision that the tax levied is in fact a levy on the consumer. The person who pays the tax in the first instance is acting as an agent of the state for the collection and payment of the tax and as such may not collect a tax on table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume for any other level of government.\n\n(2) The tax levied in subsection (d) shall be collected by a monthly return, which shall be filed by the wholesale licensees with the board not later than the 15th day of the second month following the month of receipt of table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume by the wholesaler on a form prescribed by the board showing receipts by the wholesalers from manufacturer, importer, or other wholesaler licensees during the month of receipt and the taxes due thereon at the rate of two dollars and forty-two cents ($2.42) per liter of table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume sold to the wholesale licensee or board; the taxes due at such rate shall be remitted to the board along with the return.\n\n(3) The tax levied in subsection (d) shall be collected by the board on table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume sold by the board and shall be paid as follows: Taxes at the rate of two dollars and forty-two cents ($2.42) per liter of table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume sold shall be remitted by the board to the State Treasurer.\n\n(4) The board shall have the authority to examine the books and records of any person who sells, stores, or receives for the purpose of distribution any table wine containing more than sixteen and one-half percent alcohol by volume, to determine the accuracy of any return required to be filed with it.\n\n(f) Disposition of proceeds.
