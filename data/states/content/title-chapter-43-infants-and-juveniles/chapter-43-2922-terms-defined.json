Domestic intimate partner abuse2. Joint legal custody3. Parental relationship4. Parenting time1. Domestic intimate partner abuseAn ex-husband's conviction for stalking was not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish domestic intimate partner abuse because domestic intimate partner abuse requires an act of abuse as defined in section 42-903 and the evidence adduced at trial failed to show such an act. Mann v. Mann, 316 Neb. 910, 7 N.W.3d 845 (2024).\"Domestic intimate partner abuse,\" pursuant to subdivision (8) of this section, requires both attempting to cause or intentionally and knowingly causing bodily injury with or without a dangerous instrument to a family or household member and a pattern or history of abuse. Blank v. Blank, 303 Neb. 602, 930 N.W.2d 523 (2019).2. Joint legal custodyIn the absence of an explicit contrary definition in a parenting plan, the term \"joint legal custody\" must be construed according to its statutory definition in the Parenting Act. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 311 Neb. 495, 973 N.W.2d 171 (2022).The definitions in the Parenting Act of \"legal custody\" and \"joint legal custody\" are terms of art having clear and unambiguous meaning. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 311 Neb. 495, 973 N.W.2d 171 (2022).Under the Parenting Act, joint legal custody involves mutual authority and responsibility of the parents while legal custody does not. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 311 Neb. 495, 973 N.W.2d 171 (2022).In a case where parents shared joint legal custody of the minor child, and neither parent had final decisionmaking authority, the mother's unilateral decision to change the minor child's school was a willful violation of the decree of dissolution of marriage. As such, this is a matter to be considered at an evidentiary hearing where the father could offer evidence to demonstrate both that a violation of the court order occurred and that the violation was willful. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 309 Neb. 376, 960 N.W.2d 309 (2021).Joint legal custody is the joint authority and responsibility for making major decisions regarding the child's welfare, while sole legal custody essentially establishes that one party will have the final say in such decisions. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 309 Neb. 376, 960 N.W.2d 309 (2021).Where the parenting plan indicates the parties were to share joint legal custody of the minor child, and where neither party was granted exclusive final decisionmaking authority, it is undisputed that the parties share mutual authority for making fundamental decisions regarding the minor child's welfare, including choices regarding education, such as where the minor child will attend school. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 309 Neb. 376, 960 N.W.2d 309 (2021).Joint legal custody is separate and distinct from joint physical custody, and an appellate court will address each separately. Donald v. Donald, 296 Neb. 123, 892 N.W.2d 100 (2017).An order governing custody was an award of \"joint physical custody,\" rather than an award of \"sole physical custody\" to the mother, although the trial court referred to it as an award of \"sole physical custody,\" where the custody order granted the father parenting time that amounted to seven overnights out of fourteen, and each parent was granted continuous blocks of parenting time for significant periods. State on behalf of Emery W. v. Michael W., 28 Neb. App. 956, 951 N.W.2d 177 (2020).3. Parental relationshipPursuant to subdivision (17) of this section, the parental relationship should be found to exist only if the facts and circumstances show that the individual means to take the place of the lawful parent, not only in providing support but also with reference to the natural parent's office of educating and instructing and caring for the general welfare of the child. The mother's former boyfriend did not stand in loco parentis to the child because he had a minimal role in fulfilling parenting functions during the parties' relationship and after their separation; his role primarily entailed playing with the child and looking after her for brief periods of time. Peister v. Eurek, 30 Neb. App. 366, 969 N.W.2d 134 (2021).4. Parenting timeThe mother's decision to move the child 4 hours away deprived the father of his court-ordered parenting time. Thus, the district court abused its discretion in failing to issue an order to show cause as to why the mother did not willfully violate the decree of dissolution in regard to the father's parenting time. Vyhlidal v. Vyhlidal, 309 Neb. 376, 960 N.W.2d 309 (2021).",
