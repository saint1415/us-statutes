The member shall provide notice of the move to the secretary of the local board of education before the commencement of business at the first meeting of the local board of education following the move. The boundaries of such single member districts shall be determined by a majority vote of the county board of education. The county board of education shall apportion the districts according to the last federal decennial census for the county utilizing the principle of equal representation.
