Library media specialists shall be consulted in budgeting all library enhancement funds.\n\n(b) The procedures for ordering, and the regulations applying to, classroom instructional support shall be as follows:\n\n(1) BUDGET COMMITTEE. Each school shall have a budget committee. The committee shall be comprised of five members consisting of four teachers and the school’s principal, or the principal’s designee. The teachers on the committee shall be elected annually by secret ballot by majority vote of the teachers voting at each school. The budget committee shall propose a budget for classroom instructional support, excluding student materials. The proposed budget shall be consistent with the latest plans for professional development and technology developed at the local school level by the principal and faculty and submitted by the local board of education to the State Superintendent of Education pursuant to Section 16-13-231(b)(1)e. The proposed budget shall outline common purchases and shall specify the common items which may be purchased. The proposed budget shall also specify the amount to be allotted for each teacher, if applicable. Any funds allocated by the Legislature for student materials shall be given directly to each teacher as specified in the allocation for use directly in his or her classroom as determined exclusively by the teacher. The committee shall elect a chairperson from among its membership. The committee shall also elect a secretary from its membership who shall be responsible for keeping minutes of the meetings of the budget committee and actions taken to approve the budget during the secret balloting process. The committee may form advisory subcommittees from teachers at the various grade or department levels, or both levels.\n\n(2) APPROVAL BY TEACHERS. The proposed budget from the budget committee shall be submitted to the teachers at an annual meeting. Before any part of any proposed budget is implemented, the teachers at the school, through a majority vote of those voting, shall approve the proposed budget utilizing a secret balloting process. Teachers shall have at least two work days to review the proposed budget before a vote is taken. Any proposed budget which does not receive approval shall be returned to the budget committee for reformulation, taking into consideration the teachers’ recommendations offered at the school’s annual meeting at the beginning of the school year or at a spring meeting at the end of the scholastic year, or both. If the proposed budget is not approved, the budget committee shall submit another proposed budget for review and consideration by the teachers, and this procedure shall continue until such time as the teachers approve a budget utilizing the procedures of this section. A report on the budget which is approved by a majority vote of the teachers voting shall be transmitted to the local superintendent on uniform forms provided by the State Department of Education.\n\n(3) DUTIES OF LOCAL SUPERINTENDENT. The local superintendent shall submit a notarized affidavit to the State Superintendent of Education. The affidavit shall certify that all funds allocated for classroom instructional support have been properly spent and that all legal requirements have been properly observed and implemented. On the affidavit, the superintendent shall certify the amount of monies expended at each school, delineating the amounts spent for collective purchases and the amounts received by the teachers at each school. The local superintendent shall take care to insure that each teacher employed is able to order and receive his or her allocation of classroom instructional support during each year as provided in this section.\n\n(4) TIMELINESS. Any or all of the funds for classroom instructional support shall be made available to each teacher before December 1. The teacher may order, in whole or in part, his or her allocation anytime during the applicable fiscal year. It is the intent of the Legislature that teachers should have their full allocation of classroom instructional support as soon in the school year as possible in order to promote learning.\n\n(5) PERMISSIBLE EXPENDITURES. Monies allocated for classroom instructional support may be spent for classroom instructional support purposes only, to be used either by classroom teachers or students in each teacher’s respective classes. It shall be permissible to expend these monies on instructional equipment and electrical equipment which is actually utilized with students in the teacher’s classroom.

However, for purposes of applying accrued sick leave as credit for retirement purposes, an employee is limited to a maximum of sick leave as authorized in subdivision (b)(1). As pertains to receiving retirement credit for accrued sick leave, the Teacher’s Board of Control may adopt policies and procedures necessary to effectuate a uniform policy pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) Employees of the Alabama State Senate, the Lieutenant Governor, the Office of the Senate President Pro Tempore, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Alabama House of Representatives, and the Legislative Services Agency may only accrue unlimited sick leave under this section until January 1, 2013. On January 1, 2013, an employee subject to this section may carry over only the actual number of sick leave hours the employee has or the number allowed under Section 36-26-36, whichever is greater. After January 1, 2013, sick leave earned by an employee subject to this section in excess of the amount determined on January 1, 2013, is subject to Section 36-26-36(d).\n\n(d) On-the-job injury. The following regulations, procedures, and rights are established pertaining to employees who are injured while on the job:\n\n(1) NOTICE OF INJURY. The employee shall make proper notification of the injury to the executive officer, or to the principal of the school, if applicable, within 24 hours after the injury occurred, or where the employee is not clinically able to make notification, another person who is reasonably knowledgeable may make the notification of the injury. Other notification procedures and forms shall be as established by written policy of the employer.\n\n(2) PHYSICIAN CERTIFICATION. The employer may require medical certification from the employee’s physician that the employee was injured and cannot return to work as a result of the injury. The executive officer, at his or her discretion, may require a second opinion from another physician at the expense of the employer. The employer may require a statement from the physician that there is a reasonable expectation that the employee will be able to return to work. A uniform physician certification form shall be adopted by the State Board of Education and distributed to each executive officer.\n\n(3) SALARY CONTINUED. Upon determination by the executive officer that an employee has been injured on the job and cannot return to work as a result of the injury, the salary and fringe benefits of the employee shall be continued for a period of up to 90 working days consistent with the employee’s injury and the subsequent absence from work resulting from the injury. This provision shall apply to the temporary disability of the employee as applicable to the job-related injury.\n\n(4) EXTENSION OF DAYS. The employer may adopt a written policy to extend the 90-day sick leave period for on-the-job injuries. Additional job-injury policies may be adopted by the employer if the policies do not conflict with the section.\n\n(5) REIMBURSEMENT TO EMPLOYER. Any reasonable on-the-job injury costs incurred by the employer, to hire a substitute, per absent injured employee in a fiscal year shall be reimbursed to the employer by the state during the next succeeding fiscal year upon application by the employer to the appropriate State Board of Education department on a form adopted by the state board, not to exceed 90 working days. The department shall subsequently submit the request to the Legislature as a line-item in its budget request for reimbursement to the employer, and, if approved by the Legislature, shall reimburse the employer at the amount per day for sick leave authorized and funded in the annual budget act for public schools and colleges.\n\n(6) EMPLOYEE’S SICK LEAVE. Sick leave shall not be deducted from the employee’s account if absence from work is found to be a result of an on-the-job injury.\n\n(7) ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. Any unreimbursed medical expenses and costs that the employee incurs as a result of an on-the-job injury may be filed for reimbursement with the State Board of Adjustment. Reimbursement to the employee shall be determined by the Board of Adjustment’s policies, rules, and regulations which may be adopted from time to time. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt appropriate rules, regulations, and forms for submission by the employee.\n\n(8) The executive officer, or his or her designee, shall inform the employee who is injured on the job of his or her rights about appearing before the Board of Adjustment and also about applicable written policies within 30 calendar days after notification of the injury.\n\n(e) Vacations and leaves of absences. The employer, under the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the State Board of Education, may provide for paid leaves of absences and vacations for its employees. Payment may be from public funds. The employer may provide for leaves of absence during the times the schools are, or are not, in session when the teacher or employee devotes the leave to instructing in or attending schools for appropriate training, or when approved by the State Board of Education as beneficial to the state’s educational objectives. The employer may also provide for the payment of any full-time teachers or employees for absences during the time schools are in session when the absence results from an unavoidable cause that prevents the teacher or employee from discharging his or her duties. Pay for the absences resulting from unavoidable causes other than sickness shall not be allowed for a longer time than one week during any one scholastic year.\n\n(f) Alabama Community College System annual leave. As applied to Alabama Community College System employers, any employee who earns and accumulates annual leave may accumulate up to 60 days of annual leave at a rate not to exceed that in the policy established by the State Board of Education.\n\n(g) Policies. The policies and procedures required and permitted by this section shall be adopted by the employer consistent with and as required by Section 16-1-30.\n\n(Acts 1994, 1st Ex. Sess., No. 94-825, p. 154, §§1, 2; Acts 1996, No. 96-614, p. 973, §1; Act 99-578, p. 1303, §1; Act 2001-671, p. 1406, §1; Act 2012-376, p. 938, §1; Act 2023-352, §1.)",

A local board of education shall treat a student’s voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint, if any, on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner the local board of education treats a student’s voluntary expression of a secular or other viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject and may not discriminate against the student based on a religious viewpoint expressed by the student on an otherwise permissible subject.\n\n(c) Students may express their beliefs about religion in homework, artwork, and other written and oral assignments free from discrimination based on the religious content of their submissions. Homework and classroom assignments shall be judged by ordinary academic standards of substance and relevance and against other legitimate pedagogical concerns identified by the local board of education. Students may not be penalized or rewarded on account of the religious content of their work. If an assignment requires a student’s viewpoint to be expressed in coursework, artwork, or other written or oral assignments, a public school may not penalize or reward a student on the basis of religious content or a religious viewpoint. In such an assignment, a student’s academic work that expresses a religious viewpoint shall be evaluated based on ordinary academic standards of substance and relevance to the course curriculum or requirements of the coursework or assignment.\n\n(d)(1) Students in public schools may pray or engage in religious activities or religious expression before, during, and after the school day in the same manner and to the same extent that students may engage in nonreligious activities or expression. Students may organize prayer groups, religious clubs, “see you at the pole” gatherings, or other religious gatherings before, during, and after school to the same extent that students are permitted to organize other noncurricular student activities and groups. Religious groups shall be given the same access to school facilities for assembling as is given to other noncurricular groups without discrimination based on the religious content of the students’ expression. If student groups that meet for nonreligious activities are permitted to advertise or announce meetings of the groups, the local board of education may not discriminate against groups that meet for prayer or other religious speech. A local board of education may disclaim school sponsorship of noncurricular groups and events in a manner that neither favors nor disfavors groups that meet to engage in prayer or religious speech.\n\n(2) Students in public schools may wear clothing, accessories and jewelry that display religious messages or religious symbols in the same manner and to the same extent that other types of clothing, accessories, and jewelry that display messages or symbols are permitted.\n\n(e) In order to ensure that a local board of education does not discriminate against a student’s publicly stated voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint, if any, and to eliminate any actual or perceived affirmative school sponsorship or attribution to the local board of education of a student’s expression of a religious viewpoint, if any, each local board of education shall adopt a policy governing voluntary religious expression in its schools.\n\n(f) This section shall not be construed to authorize this state or any of its political subdivisions to do either of the following:\n\n(1) Require any person to participate in prayer or in any other religious activity.\n\n(2) Violate the constitutional rights of any person.\n\n(g) This section shall not be construed to limit the authority of any public school to do any of the following:\n\n(1) Maintain order and discipline on the campus of the public school in a content and viewpoint neutral manner.\n\n(2) Protect the safety of students, employees, and visitors of the public school.\n\n(3) Adopt and enforce policies and procedures regarding student speech at school provided that the policies and procedures do not violate the rights of students as guaranteed by the United States and Alabama Constitutions and laws.\n\n(h) This section shall apply to all religions.

      "text": "Section 16-1-24.1\n\nSafe School and Drug-Free School Policy; Treatment of Policy Violators; Promulgation and Distribution of Discipline Policy; Liability Limited for Discipline Actions; Local Boards May Adopt More Stringent Guidelines.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds a compelling public interest in ensuring that schools are made safe and drug-free for all students and school employees. The Legislature finds the need for a comprehensive safe school and drug-free school policy to be adopted by the State Board of Education. This policy should establish minimum standards for classes of offenses and prescribe uniform minimum procedures and penalties for those who violate the policies. It is the intent of the Legislature that our schools remain safe and drug-free for all students and school employees. The State Board of Education shall adopt and all local boards of education shall uniformly enforce policies that protect all students and school employees. The State Board of Education shall require local school systems to modify their policies, practices or procedures so as to ensure a safe school environment free of illegal drugs, alcohol, or weapons. Any rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to this section shall be exempt from Section 41-22-3(3). These modifications shall include the formulation of a discipline plan setting forth policies, practices, and procedures dealing with students or other persons who bring illegal drugs, alcohol, or weapons on a school campus. The discipline plan shall also include uniform drug-free school policies with uniform penalties.\n\n(b) The principal shall notify appropriate law enforcement officials when any person violates local board of education policies concerning drugs, alcohol, weapons, physical harm to a person, or threatened physical harm to a person. If any criminal charge is warranted arising from the conduct, the principal is authorized to sign the appropriate warrant. If that person is a student enrolled in any public school in the State of Alabama, the local school system shall immediately suspend that person from attending regular classes and schedule a hearing at the earliest possible date, which shall not be later than five school days. The decision to suspend or initiate criminal charges against a student, or both, shall include a review and consideration of the student’s exceptional status, if applicable, under Chapter 39, or appropriate federal statutory or case law.\n\n(c) If a person is found to have violated a local board of education policy concerning drugs, alcohol, weapons, physical harm to a person, or threatened physical harm to a person, the person may not be readmitted to the public schools of this state until (1) criminal charges or offenses arising from the conduct, if any, have been disposed of by appropriate authorities and (2) the person has satisfied all other requirements imposed by the local board of education as a condition for readmission.\n\n(d) Any person determined to be guilty of an offense involving drugs, alcohol, weapons, physical harm to a person, or threatened physical harm to a person, may be readmitted to the public schools of this state upon such conditions as the local board of education shall prescribe for preservation of the safety or security of students and employees of the local school board, which may include, but are not limited to, psychiatric or psychological evaluation and counseling.\n\n(e)(1) A copy of the school system’s discipline plan shall be distributed to all students enrolled in the system and their parents, guardians, or custodians shall read the plan and sign a statement verifying that they have been given notice of the discipline policies of their respective school system. The school board shall have its official discipline plan reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that its policies and procedures are currently in compliance with applicable statutes, case law, and state and federal constitutional provisions.\n\n(2) All discipline plans of school systems shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:\n\na. A parent, guardian, custodian, or person, excluding a foster parent, responsible for the care or control of a minor child enrolled in a public school system shall be responsible financially for such child’s destructive acts against school property or persons.\n\nb. A parent, guardian, custodian, or person, excluding a foster parent, responsible for the care or control of a minor child enrolled in a public school system may be requested to appear at school by an appropriate school official for a conference regarding acts of the child specified in paragraph a.\n\nc. A parent, guardian, custodian, or person, excluding a foster parent, responsible for the care or control of a minor child enrolled in a school system who has been summoned by proper notification by an appropriate school official shall be required under this provision to attend such discipline conference specified in paragraph b.\n\n(3) Any public school system shall be entitled to recover actual damages, plus necessary court costs, from the parent or guardian, or both, of any minor who maliciously and willfully damages or destroys property belonging to the school system. However, this section shall not apply to parents whose parental control of any child has been removed by court order or decree or to parents of exceptional children with specific mental and physical impairments if the damage is determined to result from the impairments. The action authorized in this section shall be in addition to all other actions which the school system is entitled to maintain and nothing in this section shall preclude recovery in a greater amount from the minor or from a person, including the parents or guardian, or both, for damages to which such minor other person would otherwise be liable.\n\n(4) This section shall apply only to acts committed on or after August 1, 1992.\n\n(f) The local school board shall adopt and make available to all teachers, school personnel, students, and parents or guardians, at the beginning of the 1992-93 school year and each school year thereafter, a code of student conduct developed in consultation with teachers, school personnel, students, and parents or guardians. The code shall be based on the rules governing student conduct and discipline adopted by the school board and may be made available at the school level in the student handbook or similar publication. The code shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:\n\n(1) Specific grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n(2) Procedures to be followed for acts requiring discipline.\n\n(3) An explanation of the responsibilities and rights of students with regard to attendance, respect for persons and property, knowledge and observation of rules of conduct, the right to learn, free speech and student publications, assembly, privacy, and participation in school programs and activities.\n\n(g) Except in the case of excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment, no certified or noncertified employee of the State Board of Education or any local board of education shall be civilly liable for any action carried out in conformity with state law and system or school rules regarding the control, discipline, suspension, and expulsion of students.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a local board of education from promulgating more stringent rules and regulations than those adopted on the state level, in order to foster and maintain a safe and drug-free environment in the public schools.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-323, p. 602, §22; Acts 1994, 1st Ex.

A local school board, and not individual board members, is entrusted with this responsibility. To function effectively, board members, both individually and collectively, must operate with the highest degree of accountability to these responsibilities and their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the local school system, without self-interest. A board member, as an individual, shall satisfy minimum qualifications to serve, shall comply with a code of conduct, and shall be required to participate in orientation and ongoing training. To meet the goal of comprehensive board member education and proficiency, governance standards should be clearly reflected in board member training with a focus on roles and responsibilities, student and school performance standards, and the delineation of each member’s role as a public official holding public trust.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) BOARDSMANSHIP. The effective discharge of duties as a member of a local board of education in keeping with the highest standards of stewardship and principles of public service as provided in this section.\n\n(2) LOCAL BOARD OF EDUCATION. A city or county board of education whether elected or appointed.\n\n(d)(1) In conjunction with and as a precondition to the installation of any elected or appointed member of a local board of education, and in addition to all other requirements imposed by law, prospective members shall be required for each term of office to affirm publicly and in writing all of the following principles of educational governance:\n\na. That each decision, action, and vote taken or made as a member of a local board of education shall be based solely on the needs and interests of students or the system.\n\nb. That no decision, action, or vote shall be taken or made to serve or promote the personal, political, or pecuniary interests of the member.\n\nc. That each decision, action, and vote shall be based on the interests of the school system as a whole.\n\nd. That the views of all members of the local board of education and of the local superintendent of education shall be considered before making a decision or taking an action on any measure or proposal before the local board of education.\n\ne. That, except to the extent otherwise provided by law, each member of a local board of education shall take formal action upon the written recommendation of and in consultation with the local superintendent of education, and may not individually or jointly attempt to direct or corrupt the operations of the school system in a manner that is inconsistent with the discharge of the statutory functions and responsibilities of the local superintendent of education.\n\nf. That each member of a local board of education shall actively promote public support for the school system and a sound statewide system of public education, and shall endorse ideas, initiatives, and programs that are designed to improve the quality of public education for all students.\n\ng. That each member of a local board of education shall attend scheduled meetings and actively participate in school system functions, activities, and training programs that promote quality boardsmanship unless good cause is shown.\n\n(2) In addition to those duties specifically enumerated in the Code of Alabama 1975, a local board of education shall have all of the following duties:\n\na. In concert with the local superintendent of education, to establish a vision for the school system by adopting goals that address student needs, advance student performance, and monitor implementation of policies and programs by reviewing data.\n\nb. To adopt written policies and programs, upon the recommendation of the local superintendent of education, to further the educational goals of the system and respond to system needs.\n\nc. To act on personnel recommendations submitted by the local superintendent of education in a timely manner, based on student needs and system finances, without regard to personal preferences or political interests.\n\nd. In concert with the local superintendent of education, to consider and approve operating budgets for the system aligned with the goals and objectives of the local board of education.\n\ne. To advocate for the needs, resources, and interests of public school students and refer stakeholders and constituents to the local superintendent of education so that these issues can be addressed by school system personnel.\n\nf. These duties should not be construed to limit or change the duties of local boards of education as found in the Code of Alabama 1975.\n\n(e) In order to further the implementation of sound principles of boardsmanship within and among the local boards of education in the state, the State Superintendent of Education shall develop continuing education and training programs for the members of the local boards of education to enhance the understanding of the role of each member in assuring the effective provision of educational services. The programs shall be developed in cooperation with the Alabama Association of School Boards pursuant to Section 16-1-6.\n\n(f) Any member of a local board of education who fails to satisfy the standards of boardsmanship as provided in this section, or other statutory duty or obligation, under circumstances that constitute neglect of duty or willful misconduct, may be subject to the following sanctions:\n\n(1) Formal censure or reprimand upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the local board of education on which he or she serves. No such action shall be taken unless the member, who is the subject of the proposed action, is provided at least 30 days’ advance written notice of the proposed action by the secretary of the local board of education.

On the basis of the investigation, the State Superintendent of Education may either decline to pursue formal sanctions or issue a written notice to the board members whose conduct is in question, which notice shall specify the proposed imposition of any sanctions that are contemplated as a result of the investigation. The notice shall also describe with reasonable particularity the neglect of duty, misconduct, or other breach of legal duty upon which any proposed sanction is based. The board member shall have at least 30 days to show cause in person or in writing why he or she should not be subject to the proposed sanction or to otherwise object to the proposed sanction. Upon request, the board member shall be granted a hearing before the State Superintendent of Education, or his or her designee, for the purpose of contesting any proposed sanction.\n\n(3) After the close of the investigation, review, and hearing authorized by this section, the State Superintendent of Education may recommend approval of any of the following sanctions to the State Board of Education:\n\na. A formal censure or reprimand of the board member.\n\nb. For any board member who fails to meet mandated training and attendance requirements, the member shall be subject to disqualification from eligibility for future appointment, reappointment, or election to any local board of education in the state.\n\nc. For a board member whose conduct is found by the State Superintendent of Education to constitute neglect of duty or willful misconduct, the member shall be subject to disqualification from eligibility for future appointment, reappointment, or election to any local board of education in the state.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to preclude a negotiated resolution of any action that may be proposed or initiated by the State Superintendent of Education under this section, provided that such resolution is suitably memorialized, executed, made a matter of public record, and is consistent with the purposes of this section.\n\n(5) No sanction shall be imposed on the basis of the exercise of personal, political, or other rights of a board member that are protected by the United States Constitution or by any state or federal statute.\n\n(6) No sanction by the State Superintendent of Education, other than as may be imposed by written agreement with the board member, shall be effective until it is approved by majority vote of the State Board of Education.\n\n(g) The State Board of Education shall adopt a model code of conduct for members of local boards of education by January 1, 2013. Before April 1, 2013, each local board of education shall adopt a code of conduct that includes, at a minimum, the model code of conduct adopted by the State Board of Education. The State Superintendent of Education shall develop and issue regulations to implement the requirements of this section, including any regulations deemed necessary and appropriate to ensure that procedures to be followed in connection with the imposition of sanctions authorized under this section conform to applicable legal standards.\n\n(h) This section is cumulative and in addition to any other provision of law governing the training, performance, and accountability of local boards of education and members of local boards of education in the State of Alabama.\n\n(Act 2012-221, p. 399, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 16-1-52\n\nParticipation in Athletic Events to Be Based on Biological Sex of Athletes.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:\n\n(1) Physical differences between biological males and biological females have long made separate and sex-specific sports teams important so that female athletes can have equal opportunities to compete in sports.\n\n(2) Physical advantages for biological males relevant to sports include, on average, a larger body size with more skeletal muscle mass, a lower percentage of body fat, and greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy than biological females.\n\n(3) Even at young ages, biological males typically score higher than biological females on cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and speed and agility. These differences become more pronounced during and after puberty as biological males produce higher levels of testosterone. On average, biological male athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and more physically powerful than their biological female counterparts. This results in a significant sports performance gap between the sexes.\n\n(4) Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to biological male athletes is not significantly diminished through the use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone suppression in biological males does not result in a level playing field between biological male and biological female athletes.\n\n(5) Because of the physical differences between biological males and biological females, having separate athletic teams based on the athletes’ biological sex reduces the chance of injury to biological female athletes and promotes sex equality. It provides opportunities for biological female athletes to compete against their peers rather than against biological male athletes, and allows biological female athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and other athletic accomplishments.\n\n(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), a public K-12 school may not participate in, sponsor, or provide coaching staff for interscholastic athletic events within this state that are either scheduled by or conducted under the authority of any athletic association of the state that permits or allows participation in athletic events within the state conducted exclusively for males by any individual who is not a biological male or participation in athletic events within the state conducted exclusively for females by any individual who is not a biological female.\n\n(2) A public K-12 school may not allow a biological female to participate on a male team if there is a female team in a sport. A public K-12 school may not allow a biological male to participate on a female team.\n\n(c) Subsection (b) does not apply to athletic events at which both biological males and biological females are permitted or allowed to participate.\n\n(d)(1) An intercollegiate athletic teamor sport sponsored by a public two-year or four-yearinstitution of higher education that is designated forfemales, women, or girls shall not be open to a biologicalmale.\n\n(2) An intercollegiate athletic team orsport sponsored by a public two-year or four-year institutionof higher education that is designated for males, men, or boysshall not be open to a biological female.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed torestrict the eligibility of any student to participate on anyintercollegiate or intramural athletic team or sportdesignated as coed or mixed.\n\n(e) A governmental entity, licensing or accreditingorganization, or athletic association or organization may not do either of the following:\n\n(1) File a complaint, open an investigation, or takeany other adverse action against a public K-12 school orpublic two-year or four-year institution of higher educationfor maintaining separate athletic teams or sports for studentsof the female sex or male sex.\n\n(2) Retaliate or take any adverse action against astudent who reports an alleged violation of this section toan employee or representative of the public K-12 school,public two-year or four-year institution of higher education,athletic association or organization, or to any state orfederal agency with oversight of public K-12 schools or publictwo-year or four-year institutions of higher education in thestate.\n\n(f) Any student who is directly deprived of an athleticopportunity or suffers any direct harm as a resultof a violation of this section shall have a private cause ofaction for injunctive relief, damages, attorney fees, and anyother relief available under the law. All civil actions underthis section shall be initiated within two years from the datethe harm occurred.\n\n(g) Except as provided in Section 36-1-12, no causeof action may be maintained against any employee, officer,agent, trustee, director, or board member of a public K-12school, public two-year or four-year institution of highereducation, athletic association, or organization whose actionswere in compliance with subdivisions (d)(1) and (d)(2).\n\n(h) It is the intent of the Legislature that constitutionally created boards of trustees comply with therequirements of this section.\n\n(Act 2021-285, §§1, 2; Act 2023-293, §1.)",
