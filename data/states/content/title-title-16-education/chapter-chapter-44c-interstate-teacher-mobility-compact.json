Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state, as the rules and bylaws may be amended as provided in this compact.\n\n(d) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n(1) A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n(e) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.\n\n(Act 2023-234, §11.)",
