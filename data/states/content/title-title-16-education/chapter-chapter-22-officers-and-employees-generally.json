The chief executive officer of the authority shall be responsible for conducting the election in a fair and equitable manner, ensuring the confidentiality of the secret balloting process. The chief executive officer of the authority shall also appoint the authority’s representative on the committee, subject to board approval.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, it shall be the exclusive responsibility of the sick leave bank committee to write the guidelines and administrative procedures of the sick leave bank, including the catastrophic leave provisions of this section. It shall also be the committee’s duty to develop all necessary forms for the orderly operation and administration of the sick leave bank and catastrophic leave provisions of this section.

The days deposited shall be available to be loaned to any participating member whose sick leave has been exhausted.\n\n(f) Upon the establishment of a sick leave bank, the sick leave bank committee shall establish procedures providing for the uniform administration of the sick leave bank. Guidelines shall be developed by the sick leave bank committee for the operation of the sick leave bank. The guidelines shall be approved by a secret ballot vote of the participating members of the sick leave bank. The accounting of the sick leave bank shall be the responsibility of the authority. Vacancies occurring on the committee shall be filled by the respective parties. No representative on the committee shall serve for a term longer than five years.\n\n(g) Each sick leave bank’s guidelines shall include the regulations of this section.

Upon the resignation or other termination of an employee who has an outstanding loan of sick leave days, the value of the loan shall be deducted from the final paycheck at the employee’s prevailing rate of pay.\n\n(4) A member of the sick leave bank shall not be allowed to accumulate more days than allowed in Section 16-1-18.1, including days in the sick leave bank.\n\n(5) Employee membership in the sick leave bank shall be voluntary.\n\n(6) Any alleged abuse of the use of the sick leave bank shall be investigated by the sick leave bank committee.

However, if the member later qualifies for catastrophic sick leave, donated catastrophic sick leave days may be used to repay days owed to the sick leave bank to the credit of the affected member.\n\n(9) At the beginning of the scholastic year, or upon employment of a new employee, as the case may be, the appropriate number of sick leave days shall, upon application of the employee, be credited to the employee’s account to enable the employee to join the sick leave bank if the employee does not have the minimum number of sick leave days to enable him or her to join the bank. The sick leave bank committee shall develop in its guidelines a provision whether or not to allow other employees who have previously failed or refused to join the sick leave bank the option to join upon deposit of the prerequisite number of sick leave days. Any policy developed by the sick leave bank committee shall be uniformly applied to all employees.\n\n(h) Catastrophic sick leave. Employees, at their discretion, may donate a specific number of days to the sick leave bank to be designated for a specific employee for use against a catastrophic illness as defined by this section. A donating employee shall not be required to donate a minimum number of catastrophic days to the sick leave bank. The recipient employee may use catastrophic sick leave days for himself or herself or for other covered persons as provided in Section 16-1-18.1. Before sick leave days for a catastrophic illness may be used by a recipient employee, the recipient employee shall have first exhausted all sick and personal leave. Donated days shall become available for use by the particular employee who shall not be required to repay the days. Any employee who donates sick leave days to the sick leave bank for a particular employee suffering from a catastrophic illness shall be clearly informed that the donated days are not to be recovered or returned to the donor. If a particular employee does not require all of the days donated to the credit of the employee, the days shall revert to the credit of those employees who donated the days in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the sick leave bank committee. No employee may donate more than 30 sick leave days, exclusive of the provisions of subsection (e), to the sick leave bank for the catastrophic sick leave of any one employee. A sick leave bank is authorized to donate sick leave days to another sick leave bank for use by a particular employee who is suffering a catastrophic illness. An employee must be a member of the sick leave bank to donate or receive catastrophic sick leave days.\n\n(i) Compliance required. If an authority fails to comply with this section within 30 calendar days after receiving the petition to establish a sick leave bank, the State Superintendent of Education (for the public schools), the Chancellor of Postsecondary Education (for the two-year postsecondary schools), or the president of the governing board of trustees (for four-year colleges and universities) shall investigate the situation and shall immediately take due and appropriate steps to ensure compliance with this section.\n\n(Acts 1984, No. 84-321, p. 739, §§1-4; Acts 1988, No. 88-261, p. 402, §4; Acts 1993, No. 93-753, p. 1506, §§1, 2; Acts 1995, No. 95-386, p. 786, §1; Act 99-581, p. 1314, §1.)",
