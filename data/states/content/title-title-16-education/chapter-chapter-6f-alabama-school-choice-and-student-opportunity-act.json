      "text": "Section 16-6F-5\n\nEnrollment; Credits; Student Capacity; Records.\n\n(a) Open enrollment.\n\n(1) A public charter school shall be open to any student residing in the state.\n\n(2) A school system shall not require any student enrolled in the school system to attend a start-up public charter school.\n\n(3) A public charter school shall not limit admission based on ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, income level, disability, proficiency in the English language, or academic or athletic ability.\n\n(4) A public charter school may limit admission to students within a given age group or grade level and may be organized around a special emphasis, theme, or concept as stated in the school’s charter application, but fluency or competence in the theme may not be used as a standard for enrollment.\n\n(5) A public charter school shall enroll all students who wish to attend the school, unless the number of students exceeds the capacity of the facility identified for the public charter school.\n\n(6) If facility capacity is insufficient to enroll all students who wish to attend a start-up public charter school, the school shall select students through a random selection process. The school shall first enroll students who reside within the school system in which the public charter school is located. If the number of local students wanting to enroll exceeds the facility’s capacity, then the school shall conduct a random selection process to enroll students who reside in the local school system. If the school has additional capacity after admitting students from the local school system, then the school shall admit any students without regard to their residency by a random selection process. The selection shall take place in a public meeting, called by the governing body of the public charter school, and following all posting and notice requirements prescribed by the Alabama Open Meetings Act.\n\n(7) Any non-charter public school converting partially or entirely to a public charter school shall adopt and maintain a policy giving enrollment preference to students who reside within the former attendance area of that public school.\n\nAfter all students who reside within the former attendance area of that public school are enrolled, enrollment shall first be opened to students residing within the local school system and then outside the local school system, as set forth in subdivision (6).\n\n(8) A public charter school shall give enrollment preference to students enrolled in the public charter school the previous school year and to siblings of students already enrolled in the public charter school.\n\n(9) A public charter school may give enrollment preference to children of a public charter school’s founders, governing board members, and full-time employees, so long as they constitute no more than 10 percent of the school’s total student population.\n\n(10) A public charter school may give enrollment preference to children living within a certain geographical boundary, so long as the overall enrollment of the public charter school includes a majority of at-risk students. The proposed boundary shall be approved by the authorizer.\n\n(11) This subsection does not preclude the formation of a public charter school whose mission is focused on serving special education students, students of the same gender, students who pose such severe disciplinary problems that they warrant a specific educational program, or students who are at risk of academic failure. Notwithstanding the stated mission of the public charter school, any student may attend.\n\n(12) This subsection does not preclude the formation of a public charter school, that is located on or within one mile of a military installation, whose mission is focused on serving students who are dependents of military members or Department of Defense civilian employees that are permanently assigned to that military installation. If the number of dependent students wanting to enroll exceeds the facility’s capacity, then the school shall conduct a random selection process to enroll those students. If the school has additional capacity after admitting those dependent students of parents assigned to the military installation, then the school shall admit students first from the local school system by a random selection process and then without regard to their residency by a random selection process, as capacity permits. The selection shall take place in a public meeting, called by the governing body of the public charter school, and following all posting and notice requirements prescribed by the Alabama Open Meetings Act. Once the total number of students enrolled in the school reaches 400, all additional admitted students shall be dependents of military members or Department of Defense civilian employees who are permanently assigned to that military installation.\n\n(b) Credit transferability.

Nothing in this chapter shall prevent local school systems from administering placement tests for newly enrolled students who were previously enrolled in a public charter school.\n\n(c) Determination of student capacity of public charter schools. The capacity of the public charter school shall be determined annually by the governing board of the public charter school in conjunction with the authorizer and in consideration of the public charter school’s ability to facilitate the academic success of its students, to achieve the other objectives specified in the charter contract, and to ensure that its student enrollment does not exceed the capacity of its facility or site.\n\n(d) Student information. A public charter school shall maintain records on all enrolled students utilizing the state adopted Alabama Student Information System (ASIM).\n\n(Act 2015-3, p. 18, §5; Act 2021-117, §1; Act 2023-420, §1.)",

The application review process shall include thorough evaluation of each written charter application, an in-person interview with the applicant group, and an opportunity in a public forum for local residents to learn about and provide input on each application.\n\n(2) In deciding whether to approve charter applications, authorizers shall do all of the following:\n\na. Grant charters only to applicants that have demonstrated competence in each element of the authorizer’s published approval criteria and are likely to open and operate a successful public charter school.\n\nb.

If the school requires an opening delay of more than one year, the school shall request an extension from its authorizer. The authorizer may grant or deny the extension depending on the particular school’s circumstances.\n\n(e) Charter contracts.\n\n(1) Within 60 days of approval of a charter application, the authorizer and the governing board of the approved public charter school shall execute a charter contract that clearly sets forth the academic and operational performance expectations and measures by which the public charter school will be judged and the administrative relationship between the authorizer and the public charter school, including each party’s rights and duties. The performance expectations and measures set forth in the charter contract shall include, but need not be limited to, applicable federal and state accountability requirements. The performance provisions may be refined or amended by mutual agreement after the public charter school is operating and has collected baseline achievement data for its enrolled students. A governing board shall have received 501(c)(3) tax exempt status before beginning charter contract negotiations.\n\n(2) The charter contract shall be signed by the president of the authorizer’s board and the president of the public charter school’s governing body.

Such actions or sanctions may include, if warranted, requiring a school to develop and execute a corrective action plan within a specified time frame.\n\n(c) Renewals, revocations, and nonrenewals.\n\n(1) A charter may be renewed for successive five-year terms of duration, although the authorizer may vary the term based on the performance, demonstrated capacities, and particular circumstances of each public charter school. An authorizer may grant renewal with specific conditions for necessary improvement to a public charter school.\n\n(2) No later than July 15, the authorizer shall issue a public charter school performance report and charter renewal application guidance to any public charter school whose charter is scheduled to expire the following year. The performance report shall summarize the public charter school’s performance record to date, based on the data required by this chapter and the charter contract, and shall provide notice of any weaknesses or concerns perceived by the authorizer concerning the public charter school that may jeopardize its position in seeking renewal if not timely rectified.

The protocol shall specify tasks, timelines, and responsible parties, including delineating the respective duties of the school and the authorizer.\n\n(2) In the event of a public charter school closure for any reason, the authorizer shall oversee and work with the closing school to ensure a smooth and orderly closure and transition for students and parents, as guided by the closure protocol. In the event of a public charter school closure for any reason, the assets of the school shall be distributed first to satisfy outstanding payroll obligations for employees of the school, then to creditors of the school, and then to the State Treasury to the credit of the Education Trust Fund. If the assets of the school are insufficient to pay all parties to whom the school owes compensation, the prioritization of the distribution of assets may be determined by decree of a court of law.\n\n(e) Charter transfers. Transfer of a charter contract, and of oversight of that public charter school, from one authorizer to another before the expiration of the charter term shall not be permitted except by special petition to the department by a public charter school or its authorizer.

Each public charter school shall report enrollment, attendance, and other counts of students to the department in the manner required by the department.\n\n(b) Operational funding.\n\n(1) The following provisions govern operational funding:\n\na.1. In their initial year, and in subsequent years to accommodate growth as articulated in their application, start-up public charter schools shall be provided Foundation Program funding by inclusion of anticipated enrollment as provided in the approved charter application. During the fiscal year, the resulting Foundation Program allocation shall be adjusted to reconcile the variance between anticipated and actual funded enrollment.\n\n2. A conversion public charter school shall be funded at the same level as the school was funded prior to its conversion to a conversion public charter school. All federal, state, and local dollars allocated to support the conversion public charter school shall be directly appropriated by the local school board to the conversion public charter school operator. Under no circumstances may the local school board withhold funds for services without mutual agreement from the conversion public charter school operator.\n\n3. In addition to Foundation Program allocation, all start-up public charter schools shall participate in other Education Trust Fund and Public School Fund appropriations in the same manner as any other non-charter public school system. In addition to Foundation Program allocation, all conversion public charter schools shall receive from the local school board a pro rata share of other Education Trust Fund appropriations.\n\nb. For each of its students, a public charter school shall receive the same amount of state funds, including funds earmarked for the Foundation Program transportation, school nurses, technology coordinators, and other line items that may be included in the appropriation for the Foundation Program Fund which, for the then-current fiscal year, would have otherwise been allocated on behalf of each public charter school student to the local school system where the student resides. This amount shall reflect the status of each student according to grade level, economic disadvantage, limited English proficiency, and special education needs.\n\nc. For each of its students, a public charter school shall receive the same amount of local tax revenue, that, for the then-current fiscal year, would have otherwise been allocated on behalf of each public charter school student to the local non-charter public school of each student’s residence, excluding those funds already earmarked through a vote of the local school board for debt service, capital expenditures, or transportation. As necessary, the department shall adopt processes and procedures to determine the specific local revenue allocations according to the Foundation Program for each public charter school.\n\nd. The state funds described in paragraph a. shall be forwarded by the department to all start-up public charter schools on the same schedule as funds are forwarded to local school systems by the department. The state funds described in paragraph a. shall be forwarded to conversion public charter schools by the local school system on the same schedule as funds are forwarded to local school systems by the department. The local funds described in paragraph c. shall be forwarded on a quarterly basis to the public charter school by the local educational agency of the student’s residence, notwithstanding the oversight fee reductions pursuant to Section 16-6F-6. Additionally, any local revenues restricted, earmarked, or committed by statutory provision, constitutional provision, or board covenant pledged or imposed by formal action of the local board of education or other authorizing body of government, shall be excluded by the local educational agency of the student’s residence when determining the amount of funds to be forwarded by the agency to the public charter school.\n\ne. The maximum annual local tax allocation forwarded to a start-up public charter school from a local school system, for each student, shall not exceed the per student portion of the state required 10 mill ad valorem match.\n\nf. The annual local tax allocation forwarded to a conversion public charter school from a local school system, for each student, shall equal the amount that would have been received by the local education agency of the student’s residence for each student who now attends a conversion public charter school. In the event a local school system fails to honor an agreement with a conversion public charter school operator or if the local school system fails to forward the annual local tax allocation to a conversion public charter school as required by this subsection, the State Superintendent of Education shall intervene pursuant to Section 16-4-4, and allocate the local funds to the conversion public charter school accordingly.\n\ng. Annually, the department shall calculate these per-student allocations and ensure that these per-student allocations are distributed directly to start-up public charter schools and conversion public charter schools on a per-student basis.

The department shall direct the proportionate share of monies generated under federal and state categorical aid programs to all public charter schools, including start-up public charter schools and conversion public charter schools, serving students eligible for such aid. The state shall ensure that all public charter schools with rapidly expanding enrollments are treated equitably in the calculation and disbursement of all federal and state categorical aid program dollars. Each public charter school that serves students who may be eligible to receive services provided through such programs shall comply with all reporting requirements to receive the aid.\n\n(3) SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING.\n\na. The state or a local school board shall pay directly to a public charter school, including start-up public charter schools and conversion public charter schools, any federal or state aid attributable to a student with a disability attending the school.\n\nb. At either party’s request, a public charter school and its authorizer may negotiate and include in the charter contract alternate arrangements for the provision of and payment for special education services.\n\n(4) GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; INDEPENDENT AUDIT.\n\na. A public charter school shall adhere to generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nb. A public charter school shall annually engage an independent certified public accountant to do an independent audit of the school’s finances. A public charter school shall file a copy of each audit report and accompanying management letter to its authorizer by June 1. This audit shall include the same requirements as those required of local school system pursuant to Section 16-13A-7.\n\n(5) TRANSPORTATION FUNDING.\n\na. The department shall disburse state transportation funding to a public charter school on the same basis and in the same manner as it is paid to public school systems.\n\nb. A public charter school may enter into a contract with a school system or private provider to provide transportation to the school’s students.\n\nc. Public charter schools that do not provide transportation services shall not be allocated any federal, state, or local funds otherwise earmarked for transportation-related expenses.\n\n(Act 2015-3, p. 18, §10; Act 2022-371, §1(b)(3); Act 2023-420, §1.)",
