Wireless infrastructure: The first priority for the expenditure of Alabama Ahead Act funds is the establishment of a high-quality, standards-based wireless local area network (WLAN) infrastructure capable of providing all teachers and students with sufficient WiFi broadband access in all classrooms and common areas of schools, where feasible as described in WIRED.\n\nb. Standards: Local school systems shall use applicable funds to install wireless networks or upgrade existing networks to satisfy Alabama Educational Technology Association (AET) standards that include high-quality, enterprise level networking equipment.\n\nEach regular classroom shall be equipped with high-quality wireless access for 30 to 40 devices simultaneously. Each specialty classroom, that routinely serves groups of less than 20 people, may satisfy a lesser standard.\n\nEach cafeteria shall have sufficient wireless access for one-third of the then current enrollment of the school.\n\nEach library media center shall be equipped with high quality wireless access for at minimum one-third of the capacity of the library media center.\n\nEach administrative and noninstructional area of a school shall have coverage, however, high density coverage is not required in these areas.\n\nc. Upon installation and approval of the standards-based wireless infrastructure, or upgrades of existing wireless infrastructure, local school systems may use the remaining funds available to those local school systems for the purposes established pursuant to this section and Sections 16-6B-1 and 16-6B-2. To expend these funds, an application shall be submitted to the Educational Technology Department of the State Department of Education.\n\nd. Other network technology: If the wireless networks of a local school system satisfy the requirements of the Oversight Committee, funds may be spent to further enhance digital learning environments within the schools of that school system and may include technologies such as:\n\n1. Support and warranty services.\n\n2. Optional hardware and software to manage or enhance the digital learning environment.\n\ne. Network debt. Funds may be used for retiring debt for a network brought into compliance with the standards; or, for networks previously installed that satisfy the standards established by the Oversight Committee.\n\n(b) Any application for funds shall be submitted and signed by the technology coordinator, the superintendent, and the chief school financial officer of the local school system. The application shall include a component for the professional development of teachers.\n\n(c) Implementation plan: School systems shall apply for their portion of the Alabama Ahead Act funding through the State Department of Education. Applications for funding shall include all of the following:\n\n(1) Technology plan: An approved technology plan as required of all school systems as part of the Foundation Program.\n\n(2) Infrastructure readiness report: School systems shall provide an infrastructure readiness report describing each school’s WLAN as well as the systems used to manage these networks.\n\n(3) a. Accountability in the use of funds: At least every six months until the project is complete, the State Department of Education shall provide a report to the Oversight Committee detailing the progress of local school systems in meeting the 24-month goal of a statewide implementation.\n\nb. The State Department of Education shall include WLAN infrastructure functionality in its monitoring standards as part of the ongoing accountability of this investment.\n\n(Act 2016-139, §2.)",

The Authority, in the course of establishing, by resolution, a principal amount of Bonds to be authorized for sale at any given time, or to be sold in any series, may take into account the existence of any unexpended proceeds of prior issues of bonds of the Authority (and of any other issuer, if such should be deemed by the Authority to be relevant), and may structure the portions of the allocations provided for in Section 16-16B-9 to be distributed from the proceeds of a particular series (constituting less than all the Bonds authorized by this chapter) as the Authority deems necessary or prudent in order to enable the Authority to comply with any tax covenants that may be required of it, or that may be deemed by it to be prudent to be given by it, in connection with the sale of any series of the Bonds. Each series of the Bonds shall be sold competitively only at public sale, on sealed bids which may be submitted either electronically or in writing, after such advertisement as shall be prescribed by the Authority and at such time or times as the Authority may consider advantageous, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest true interest cost to the Authority computed to the respective maturities of the Bonds being sold (considering mandatory redemption as scheduled maturity); provided, that if no bid deemed acceptable by the Authority is received it may reject all bids.

The Governor’s determination in this regard shall be in writing signed by the Governor and such determination shall be final and conclusive.

Pending the application of the proceeds of Refunding Bonds issued in accordance with this Section, the proceeds, together with investment earnings therefrom, and amounts in any sinking fund, together with investment earnings thereon, may be held by the State Treasurer as treasurer of the Authority in trust, or may be deposited by the State Treasurer in trust, on such terms as the State Treasurer and the Authority shall approve, with a trustee or escrow agent, which trustee or escrow agent shall be a banking institution or trust company authorized to exercise trust powers in Alabama, for investment in Permitted Investments. Proceeds of Refunding Bonds shall be so invested and applied as to assure that the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on the Bonds being refunded shall be paid in full on the respective maturity, redemption, or interest payment dates. Refunding Bonds issued by the Authority shall not be general obligations of the Authority but shall be payable solely from the sources specified in this chapter and in the proceedings whereby the Refunding Bonds are authorized to be issued. All Refunding Bonds issued by the Authority shall be solely and exclusively obligations of the Authority and shall not create debts of the State of Alabama. The faith and credit of the State of Alabama shall never be pledged for the payment of any Refunding Bonds issued by the Authority under this chapter. The Authority may contract with respect to the safekeeping and application of the proceeds of Refunding Bonds and other funds included therewith and the income therefrom, and shall have the right and power to appoint a trustee therefor, which may be any bank or company authorized to exercise trust powers and located within and/or without the State. All other provisions of this chapter shall apply to the Refunding Bonds issued hereunder except (a) the limitation contained in Section 16-16B-3 on the amount of Bonds that may be issued under this chapter and (b) the provisions of Section 16-16B-9. All pledges made by this chapter, or by the Authority pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, for the benefit of Refunding Bonds issued under this chapter, and all such pledges for the benefit of Refunding Bonds which may be issued to refund any bonds issued under any of the 1965 Act, the 1971 Acts, the 1973 Act, the 1978 Act, the 1985 Act, the 1990 Act, the 1995 Act, the 1998 Act, the 1999 Act, the 2001 Act, the 2002 Act, the 2003 Act, the 2007 Act or this Act, shall take precedence in the order of the adoption of the resolutions authorizing the issuance of such Refunding Bonds. Bonds refunded prior to their maturity with the proceeds of Refunding Bonds shall be deemed paid and the pledges herein and by the Authority made for the payment thereof defeased if the Authority, in its proceedings regarding issuance of the Refunding Bonds shall provide for and establish a trust or escrow fund comprised of monies or Government Securities, or both, sufficient to pay, when due, the entire principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds to be refunded thereby; provided, that such Government Securities shall not be subject to redemption prior to their maturities other than at the option of the holder thereof. Upon the establishment of such a trust or escrow fund, the refunded Bonds shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, shall no longer be secured by the funds pledged therefor in Section 16-16B-6, shall no longer be obligations of the Authority and shall be secured solely by and payable from monies and Government Securities deposited in such trust or escrow fund.\n\n(Act 2012-560, p. 1645, §8.)",
