All members appointed shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified and any member may be reappointed. Immediately after each such appointment, such member of the authority shall enter upon his duties. The authority shall elect one of its members as chairman and another as vice chairman and shall appoint a secretary who need not be a member of the authority.
