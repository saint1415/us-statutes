Such meetings shall not be held on a date less than 10 days subsequent to the notice from the Governor.\n\n(b) An emergency meeting of the board may be called when circumstances exist that are deemed by the Governor or by the president pro tempore or by three members of the board to present a risk to personal health, safety, or property or to the operation of the university. The three board members must communicate their request for an emergency meeting to the Governor or to the president pro tempore by the most expedient means available to them. Notice of an emergency meeting should be given at least 72 hours prior to the time it is to commence unless the circumstances of the emergency are such that the meeting must convene sooner.\n\n(c) Members of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Alabama may participate in a meeting of the board or any committee by means of telephone conference, video conference, or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting may hear each other at the same time.

However, a majority of a quorum of the members of the board of trustees, or, in the event of a meeting of only the executive committee, a majority of a quorum of the executive committee of the board of trustees must be physically present at the location noticed and called for the meeting in order to conduct any business or deliberation. Members of the board of trustees and any committees of the board of trustees may not utilize electronic communications except as in compliance with the Alabama Open Meetings Act.
