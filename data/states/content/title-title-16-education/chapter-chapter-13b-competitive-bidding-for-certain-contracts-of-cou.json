      "text": "Section 16-13B-1\n\nApplicability; Local Preference Zone; Joint Agreement; Bid Bond.\n\n(a)(1) This chapter shall apply to county boards of education and city boards of education, or any combination of city and county boards of education as herein provided for the competitive bidding of certain contracts. With the exception of contracts for public works whose competitive bidding requirements are governed exclusively by Title 39, all expenditure of funds of whatever nature for labor, services, work, or for the purchase of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property involving forty thousand dollars ($40,000) or more, and the lease of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property where the lessee is, or becomes legally and contractually, bound under the terms of the lease, to pay a total amount of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) or more, made by or on behalf of any city or county board of education, except as hereinafter provided, shall be made under contractual agreement entered into by free and open competitive bidding, on sealed bids, to the lowest responsible bidder.\n\n(2) Beginning October 1, 2027, and every three years thereafter, all minimum dollar amounts used in this chapter shall be subject to a cost adjustment based on the following procedure: The Chief Examiner of the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts may submit to the Chair of the Legislative Council a recommendation that the amount be increased based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the immediately preceding three-year period, rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars. The recommendation shall be subject to the approval of the Legislative Council. In the event the recommendation is not disapproved by the Legislative Council by the end of April following the submission of the recommendation, the recommendation shall be deemed to be approved. Upon approval, the Chief Examiner shall notify the public of the adjusted dollar amounts by July 1 before the fiscal year in which the changes are to take effect. The increase may not exceed three percent.\n\n(b) Prior to advertising for bids for an item of personal property, where a city or county board of education, thereof is the awarding authority, the awarding authority may establish a local preference zone consisting of either the legal boundaries or jurisdiction of the awarding authority, or the boundaries of the county in which the awarding authority is located, or the boundaries of the core based statistical area (CBSA) in which the awarding authority is located. If no such action is taken by the awarding authority, the boundaries of the local preference zone shall be deemed to be the same as the legal boundaries or jurisdiction of the awarding authority. In the event a bid is received for an item of personal property to be purchased or contracted for from an individual, firm, or corporation deemed to be a responsible bidder having a place of business within the local preference zone where a city or county board of education thereof is the awarding authority, and the bid is no more than three percent greater than the bid of the lowest responsible bidder, the awarding authority may award the contract to the resident responsible bidder. In the event only one bidder responds to the invitation to bid, the awarding authority may reject the bid and negotiate the purchase or contract, provided the negotiated price is lower than the bid price.\n\n(c) The governing bodies of two or more city or county boards of education, or any combination of two or more city or county boards of education, counties, municipalities, or instrumentalities thereof, may provide, by joint agreement, for the purchase of labor, services, or work, or for the purchase or lease of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property for use by their respective agencies. The agreement shall be entered into by official actions of the contracting agencies adopted by each of the participating governing bodies which shall set forth the categories of labor, services, or work, or for the purchase or lease of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property to be purchased, the manner of advertising for bids and the awarding of contracts, the method of payment by each participating contracting agency, and other matters deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of the agreement. Each contracting agency’s share of expenditures for purchases under any agreement shall be appropriated and paid in the manner set forth in the agreement and in the same manner as for other expenses of the contracting agency. The contracting agencies entering into a joint agreement, as herein permitted, may designate a joint purchasing or bidding agent, and the agent shall comply with this chapter. Purchases, contracts, or agreements made pursuant to a joint purchasing or bidding agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this chapter. Any participation by counties and municipalities authorized in this section shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 41-16-50. In the event that utility services are no longer exempt from competitive bidding under this chapter, non-adjoining boards of education may not purchase utility services by joint agreement under authority granted by this subsection.\n\n(d) The awarding authority may require bidders to furnish a bid bond for a particular bid solicitation if the bonding requirement applies to all bidders, is included in the written bid specifications, and if bonding is available for the services, equipment, or materials.\n\n(Act 2009-760, p. 2294, §1; Act 2023-203, §1.)",

If at any time after the award has been made the lowest responsible bidder notifies the awarding authority in writing that the bidder will no longer comply with the terms of the award to provide the goods or services to the awarding authority under the terms and conditions of the original award, or the awarding authority documents that the lowest responsible bidder defaults under the terms of the original award, the awarding authority may terminate the award to the defaulting bidder and make an award to the second lowest responsible bidder for the remainder of the award period without rebidding, provided the award to the second lowest responsible bidder is in all respects made under the terms and conditions contained in the original bid specifications and is for the same or a lower price than the bid originally submitted to the awarding authority by the second lowest responsible bidder.\n\n(b) The awarding authority in the purchase of or contract for personal property or contractual services shall give preference, provided there is no sacrifice or loss in price or quality, to commodities produced in Alabama or sold by Alabama persons, firms, or corporations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no county or city board of education may specify the purchase of goods or services from a sole source, unless:\n\n(1) The board of education can document that the sole source product or service is of an indispensable nature, no other product or service can meet its needs, all other viable alternatives have been explored, and it has been determined that only this product or service will fulfill the function for which the product is needed. Frivolous features will not be considered.\n\n(2) No other vendor offers substantially equivalent goods or services that can accomplish the purpose for which the goods or services are required.\n\n(3) All information substantiating the use of a sole source specification is documented in writing and is filed into the project file.\n\n(c)(1) For purchases of personal property in instances where the awarding authority determines that the total cost of ownership over the expected life of the item or items, including acquisition costs plus sustaining costs or life cycle costs, can be reasonably ascertained from industry recognized and accepted sources, the lowest responsible bid may be determined to be the bid offering the lowest life cycle costs and otherwise meeting all of the conditions and specifications contained in the invitation to bid. To utilize this subdivision to determine the lowest responsible bidder, the awarding authority shall include a notice in the invitation to bid that the lowest responsible bid may be determined by using life cycle costs and identify the industry recognized and accepted sources that will be applicable to such an evaluation.\n\n(2) The Department of Examiners of Public Accounts shall establish procedures for the use of life cycle costs, which shall be distributed to all contracting agencies and shall be used in conducting any audits of the purchasing agency.\n\n(d) The awarding authority or requisitioning agency may reject any bid if the price is deemed excessive or quality of product inferior.\n\n(e) Each record, with the successful bid indicated thereon, and with the reasons for the award if not awarded to the lowest bidder, shall, after award of the order or contract, be open to public inspection.\n\n(f) Contracts for the purchase of personal property or contractual services shall be let for periods not greater than five years.
