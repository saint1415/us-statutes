They shall also determine and certify the sum of accumulated deferred interest, being the net difference arising from interest paid by the State Treasury to the university on the principal sum of all proceeds from sale of federal and other lands and the total interest which would have been paid at a rate equal to the highest rate paid to any public institution of higher education in Alabama upon endowments created from land sales and held by the State Treasury. The sums transferred shall be deposited in the University of Montevallo Restricted Endowment Fund, and there held inviolate, it being the purpose and intent of the State of Alabama to execute in good faith the trust reposed in it by the United States Congress when granting lands to the state for the benefit of the institution.\n\nUpon the remaining principal sum not heretofore transferred and on the accumulated deferred interest, there shall be paid interest at a rate equal to the highest rate paid to any public institution of higher education in Alabama upon endowments created from land sales and held by the State Treasury, not to exceed eight percent per annum. Interest payments on the amounts transferred under this section shall be computed and paid and shall cease upon the transfer of the amounts to the University of Montevallo Restricted Endowment Fund.\n\n(School Code 1927, §518; Code 1940, T. 52, §473; Acts 1979, No. 79-225, p. 342, §1; Acts 1980, No. 80-570, p. 882, §1; Acts 1993, No. 93-335, p. 515, §1.)",
