The report shall define the deficiency and prescribe the immediate status of the bus regarding its use; and any bus found by the inspector to be unsafe for operation shall not be used to transport pupils until appropriate repairs have been made. Any restrictions placed on a school bus by an official inspector can be lifted only:\n\n(1) When a follow-up inspection reveals that the deficiency has been removed; or\n\n(2) When the local superintendent of education certifies to the State Department of Education that the prescribed repairs or corrections have been made.\n\n(b) Records and reports relative to such inspections and corrections shall be made on forms prescribed by the State Board of Education.
