      "text": "Section 16-6D-8\n\nTax Credits; Priority Schools Income Tax Credit Account.\n\n(a) To provide educational flexibility and state accountability for students in priority schools:\n\n(1) For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2013, an Alabama income tax credit is made available to the parent of a student enrolled in or assigned to attend a priority school to help offset the cost of transferring the student to a qualifying public school or nonpublic school of the parent’s choice. The income tax credit shall be an amount equal to 80 percent of the average annual state cost of attendance for a public K-12 student during the applicable tax year or the actual cost of attending a qualifying public school or nonpublic school, whichever is less. The actual cost of attending a qualifying public school or nonpublic school shall be calculated by adding together any tuition amounts or mandatory fees charged by the school to the student as a condition of enrolling or of maintaining enrollment in the school. The average annual state cost of attendance for a public K-12 student shall be calculated by dividing the state funds appropriated to the Foundation Program pursuant to Section 16-13-231(b)(2) by the total statewide number of pupils in average daily membership during the first 20 scholastic days following Labor Day of the preceding school year. For each student who was enrolled in and attended a priority school the previous semester whose parent receives an income tax credit under this section, an amount equal to 20 percent of the average annual state cost of attendance for a public K-12 student during the applicable tax year shall be allocated, for as long as the parent receives the tax credit, to the priority school from which the student transferred if the student transfers to and remains enrolled in a nonpublic school. No such allocation shall be made in the event the student transfers to or enrolls in a qualifying public school. The Department of Education shall determine the best method of ensuring that the foregoing allocation provisions are properly implemented. A parent is allowed a credit against income tax for each taxable year under the terms established in this section. If income taxes owed by such a parent are less than the total credit allowed under this subsection, the taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund or rebate, as the case may be, equal to the balance of the unused credit with respect to that taxable year.\n\n(2) Any income tax credit due a parent under this section shall be granted or issued to the parent only upon his or her making application therefor, at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the Department of Revenue. The application process shall include, but not be limited to, certification by the parent that the student was enrolled in or was assigned to attend a priority school, certification by the parent that the student was subsequently transferred to, and was enrolled and attended, a qualifying public school or nonpublic school of the parent’s choice, and proof, satisfactory to the Department of Revenue, of the actual cost of attendance for the student at the qualifying public school or nonpublic school. For purposes of the tax credit authorized by this section, costs of attendance does not include any such costs incurred for an academic year prior to the 2013-2014 academic year. The Department of Revenue shall also prescribe the various methods by which income tax credits are to be issued to taxpayers. Income tax credits authorized by this section shall be paid out of sales tax collections made to the Education Trust Fund, and set aside by the Comptroller in the Priority Schools Income Tax Credit Account created in subsection (i), in the same manner as refunds of income tax otherwise provided by law, and there is hereby appropriated therefrom, for such purpose, so much as may be necessary to annually pay the income tax credits provided by this section.\n\n(3) An application for an income tax credit authorized by this section shall be filed with the Department of Revenue within the time prescribed for filing petitions for refund under Section 40-2A-7.\n\n(4) The Department of Revenue shall adopt reasonable rules to effectuate the intent of this subsection.\n\n(b)(1) The parent of a public school student may request and receive an income tax credit pursuant to this section to reimburse the parent for costs associated with transferring the student from a priority school to a qualifying public school or nonpublic school of the parent’s choice, in any of the following circumstances:\n\na. By assigned school attendance area, if the student spent the prior school year in attendance at a priority school and the attendance of the student occurred during a school year in which the designation was in effect.\n\nb. The student was in attendance elsewhere in the Alabama public school system and was assigned to a priority school for the next school year.\n\nc. The student was notified that he or she was assigned to a priority school for the next school year.\n\n(2) This section does not apply to a student who is enrolled in the Department of Youth Services School District.\n\n(3) For the purposes of continuity of educational choice, the tax credit shall be available to parents for those grade levels of the priority school from which the student transferred. The parent of a student who transfers from a priority school may receive income tax credits for those grade levels enrolled in and attended in the qualifying public school or nonpublic school of the parent’s choice transferred to that were included in the priority school from which the student transferred, whether or not the priority school becomes a qualifying school during those years. The parent of such a student shall no longer be eligible for the income tax credit after the student completes the highest grade level in which he or she would otherwise have been enrolled at the priority school. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as the student remains enrolled in or assigned to attend a priority school, the parent may again transfer the student to a qualifying public school or nonpublic school of the parent’s choice and request and receive an income tax credit as provided in this section.\n\n(c) A local school system, for each student enrolled in or assigned to a priority school, shall do both of the following:\n\n(1) Timely notify the parent of the student of all options available under this section as soon as the school of attendance is designated as a priority school.\n\n(2) Offer the parent of the student an opportunity to enroll the student in another public school within the local school system which is not a priority school or a priority school to which the student has been assigned.\n\n(d) The parent of a student enrolled in or assigned to a school that has been designated as a priority school, who decides to transfer the student to a qualifying public school, shall first attempt to enroll the student in a qualifying public school within the same local system in which the student is already enrolled or assigned to attend before attempting to enroll the student in a qualifying public school that has available space in any other local school system in the state. A local school system may accept the student on whatever terms and conditions the system establishes and report the student for purposes of the local school system’s funding pursuant to the Foundation Program.\n\n(e) For students in a local school system who are participating in the program, the local school system shall provide locations and times to take all statewide assessments required by law.\n\n(f) Eligible students with unique needs who are eligible to receive services from the local school system under federal or state law, and who participate in the tax credit program, remain eligible to receive services from the local school system as provided by federal or state law. The local school system shall be reimbursed by the scholarship granting organization for all contracted services provided to an eligible student and an eligible student with unique needs.\n\n(g) If a parent enrolls a student in a qualifying public school within the same local school system and that system provides transportation services for other enrolled students, transportation costs to the qualifying public school shall be the responsibility of the local school system. Local school systems may negotiate transportation options with a parent to minimize system costs. If a parent enrolls a student in a nonpublic school or in a qualifying public school within another local school system, regardless of whether that system provides transportation services for other enrolled students, transportation of the student shall be the responsibility of the parent.\n\n(h) The State Department of Education shall adopt reasonable rules to effectuate the intent of this section. Rules shall include penalties for noncompliance.\n\n(i) There is created within the Education Trust Fund a separate account named the Priority Schools Income Tax Credit Account. The Commissioner of Revenue shall certify to the Comptroller the amount of income tax credits due to parents under this section and the Comptroller shall transfer into the Priority Schools Income Tax Credit Account only the amount from sales tax revenues within the Education Trust Fund that is sufficient for the Department of Revenue to use to cover the income tax credits for the applicable tax year. The Commissioner of Revenue shall distribute the funds in the Priority Schools Income Tax Credit Account to parents pursuant to this section.\n\n(j)(1) Nothing in this section or chapter shall be construed to force any public school, school system, or school district or any nonpublic school, school system, or school district to enroll any student.\n\n(2) A public school, school system, or school district or any nonpublic school, school system, or school district may develop the terms and conditions under which it will allow a student whose parent receives an income tax credit pursuant to this section to be enrolled, but such terms and conditions may not discriminate on the basis of the race, gender, religion, color, disability status, or ethnicity of the student or of the student’s parent.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the violation of or supersede the authority of any court ruling that applies to the public school, school system, or school district, specifically any federal court order related to the desegregation of the local school system’s student population.\n\n(Act 2013-64, p. 112, §8; Act 2013-265, p. 894, §1; Act 2023-418, §1.)",

For purposes of this section, an individual taxpayer includes an individual who is a shareholder of an Alabama S corporation or a partner or member of a Subchapter K entity that made a contribution to a scholarship granting organization.\n\n(3) The tax credit may be claimed by a taxpayer subject to the Alabama corporate income tax in an amount equal to 100 percent of the total contributions the taxpayer made to a scholarship granting organization for educational scholarships during the taxable year for which the credit is claimed, up to 100 percent of the tax liability of the taxpayer.\n\n(4) A taxpayer subject to the Alabama corporate income tax, an individual taxpayer, or a married couple filing jointly may carry forward a tax credit earned under the tax credit scholarship program for up to three taxable years.\n\n(5) The cumulative amount of tax credits issued pursuant to subdivision (2) and subdivision (3) shall not exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000) annually, based on the calendar year. If the cumulative amount of tax credits issued exceeds 90 percent of the set cap for three out of four consecutive years, there shall be an automatic increase of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) until the cumulative amount of tax credits issued reaches sixty million dollars ($60,000,000). A taxpayer making one or more otherwise tax-creditable contributions before the due date, with extensions, of a timely filed 2014 tax return may elect to treat all or a portion of such contributions as applying to and creditable against its 2014 Alabama income tax liability, if the taxpayer properly reserves the credit on the website of the Department of Revenue or another method provided by the Department of Revenue. The amount creditable against the taxpayer’s 2014 income tax liability shall be limited to the lesser of the amount so designated or the remaining balance, if any, of the cumulative amount of the twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) of tax credits available for the 2014 calendar year. No such contribution and election by a taxpayer to reserve tax credits against the remaining balance of the cumulative amount of tax credits available for 2014 shall preclude the taxpayer from making additional contributions in 2015 and reserving those amounts against the cumulative amount of tax credits available for 2015. The Department of Revenue shall develop a procedure to ensure that this cap is not exceeded and shall also prescribe the various methods by which these credits are to be issued.\n\n(6) No credit may be claimed for a contribution made to a scholarship granting organization if the contribution is restricted or conditioned in any way by the donor, including, but not limited to, requiring the scholarship granting organization to direct all or part of the contribution to a particular qualifying school or to grant an educational scholarship to a particular eligible student.\n\n(b)(1) ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS. All scholarship granting organizations shall do all of the following:\n\na. Notify the Department of Revenue of their intent to provide educational scholarships to eligible students.\n\nb. Demonstrate to the Department of Revenue that they have been granted exemption from the federal income tax as an organization described in 26 U.S.C.§501(c)(3).\n\nc.

A scholarship granting organization may expend up to five percent of its revenue from donations on administrative and operating expenses in the calendar year of the donation or in any subsequent calendar year.\n\nh. Ensure that scholarship funds on hand at the beginning of a calendar year are expended on educational scholarships within three calendar years. Any scholarship funds on hand at the beginning of a calendar year that are not expended on educational scholarships within three calendar years shall be turned over to and deposited with the State Department of Education for the benefit of its At-Risk Student Program to be distributed to local boards of education on the basis determined by the State Department of Education in furtherance of support to underperforming schools.\n\ni. Ensure that at least 75 percent of first-time recipients of educational scholarships were not continuously enrolled in a private school during the previous academic year. To ensure compliance with this paragraph, the local board of education of the local school system in which an eligible student applying for an educational scholarship resides, upon written request by a parent, shall provide written verification that a particular address is in the attendance zone of a specified public school. The State Department of Education shall provide written verification of enrollment in a priority school under this chapter. With respect to first time educational scholarship recipients, scholarship granting organizations shall give priority to eligible students who are zoned to attend a priority school over eligible students who are not zoned to attend a priority school.\n\nj.

Ensure that educational scholarships are not provided for eligible students to attend a school with paid staff or board members, or relatives thereof, in common with the scholarship granting organization.\n\np. Ensure that educational scholarships are provided in a manner that does not discriminate based on the gender, race, or disability status of the scholarship applicant or his or her parent.\n\nq. Any scholarship funds unaccounted for on June 30 of each calendar year may be made available to eligible students to defray the costs of attending a qualifying school, whether or not the student is zoned to attend a priority school. Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, once an eligible student receives an educational scholarship under this program, scholarship funds may be made available to the student for educational scholarships until the student graduates from high school or reaches 19 years of age, regardless of whether the student is zoned to attend a priority school, subject to the income eligibility requirements of paragraph (5)b. of Section 16-6D-4.\n\nr. An eligible student who enrolls in a public school or public school program is considered to have terminated his or her participation in the program.
