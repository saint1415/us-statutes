      "text": "Section 16-6B-1\n\nStudent Achievement.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds that the people of Alabama desire two basic things from their public schools:\n\n(1) High achievement for students.\n\n(2) A safe and orderly environment in which to learn.\n\n(b) The Legislature encourages the State Board of Education to assist local boards of education in the development of a strong disciplinary policy and directs the State Board of Education to develop a program to closely monitor student achievement.\n\n(1) The State Board of Education shall require implementation of an assessment program for the public schools of Alabama. The assessment program may include nationally normed tests or criterion referenced tests, or both. These tests may be used to assist in the assessment of student achievement. The State Board of Education may also require the use of other tests and assessments as the board may deem necessary.\n\n(2) In grades 11 and 12, the State Board of Education shall implement an assessment and remediation program to monitor and promote the academic achievement of students in those grades and prepare them for successfully completing the graduation examination.\n\n(c) There is no legislative intent to interfere with the provisions of Section 16-3-18.3, and it is the intent of the Legislature that the development of the total assessment program for student performance, exclusive of the requirements of student performance herein, shall be the function of the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education is instructed to develop courses of study to provide Alabama students with the content and information to enter the workforce, to compete nationally and internationally with other students, and to successfully compete at the postsecondary level. This shall include the content necessary to successfully achieve on nationally normed tests and any other tests that may be required by the State Board of Education.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, §1; Act 2000-753, p. 1705, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 16-6B-2\n\nCore Curriculum.\n\nEvery Alabama student shall be given instruction in grades kindergarten through twelve to prepare him or her to enter the world of work and/or to complete course work at the postsecondary level. In addition to a comprehensive core curriculum of academics, each local board of education shall offer a program of vocational/technical education.\n\n(a) The following words and phrases used in this section shall, in the absence of a clear implication otherwise, be given the following respective interpretations:\n\n(1) REQUIRED COURSES. Courses which are required to be taken by every student enrolled in public schools in the State of Alabama.\n\n(2) ELECTIVE COURSES. Courses which are neither mandatory nor required to be taken by any student enrolled in public schools in the State of Alabama.\n\n(b) The Legislature finds that students must become more literate in the basic skills needed to earn a living or to continue their education. The Legislature further finds that the English language is a common bond that holds our society together. It is necessary that the State Board of Education adopt curriculum policies to ensure that Alabama students have a command of the spoken and written English language. The Legislature further finds that in Alabama schools, students earning a standard high school diploma are only required to earn two credits of mathematics after they enter the ninth grade prior to graduation. The Legislature further finds that special attention must be given to the Alabama courses of study. The State Board of Education shall establish a rigorous and meaningful core curriculum including, but not limited to, all of the following courses for grades nine through twelve in public schools to be phased in beginning with students entering ninth grade in the 1996-97 scholastic year:\n\n(1) Four years (equivalent of four credit units) of English.\n\n(2) Four years (equivalent of four credit units) of mathematics, including but not limited to material designed to ensure that no high school student fails to learn basic mathematical skills and computer literacy.\n\n(3) Four years (equivalent of four credit units) of science.\n\n(4) Four years (equivalent of four credit units) of social studies with an emphasis on history, music history, fine arts history, geography, economics, and political science. History courses shall include material on the history of the United States and the Constitution of the United States. The Legislature further requires that the curriculum content of American history shall include the teaching of important historical documents including the Constitution of the United States, The Declaration of Independence, The Emancipation Proclamation, The Federalist Papers, and other such documents important to the history and heritage of the United States.\n\n(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that credit for required basic core academic courses may be earned in conjunction with vocational courses and/or programs. It is the intent of the Legislature that local boards of education offer and schedule students into vocational programs.\n\n(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that, in addition to the required courses, elective courses including, but not limited to, foreign languages, fine arts, physical education, wellness education, and vocational and technical preparation be available to all students as determined by the local board of education. For purposes of this section, American Sign Language is a foreign language; a public school may offer such a course; and a student who successfully completes the course is entitled to receive credit for the course toward satisfaction of a foreign language requirement, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Alabama State Board of Education. Beginning with the 2005-2006 school year, the preceding sentence shall apply to hearing-impaired students; and beginning with the 2006-2007 school year, and each school year thereafter, the preceding sentence shall apply to all students. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to diminish the current requirements of the State Board of Education with respect to health and physical education instruction in grades K-12 or to reduce the effect of Section 16-40-1 regarding health and physical education.\n\n(e) The State Board of Education shall adopt necessary policies, procedures, rules, regulations, and standards to require that:\n\n(1) The required courses set forth in this section shall be taken by every student enrolled in grades nine through twelve of public schools to be phased in beginning with students entering the ninth grade in the 1996-97 scholastic year. The State Superintendent of Education after a hearing in which he or she determines there exists just cause may grant a one-time delay of one year for a school system from implementation of any one of the required courses.\n\n(2) The required courses set forth in this section shall be successfully passed by a student enrolled in grades nine through twelve of public schools prior to such student’s graduation or receipt of a diploma, phased in beginning with students entering the ninth grade in the 1996-97 scholastic year. Students identified as eligible for special education services as provided by federal and state law shall be required to meet the provisions set forth in the individual education plan prescribed to meet their individual needs as required by law. The State Board of Education shall continue to set graduation requirements; however, such graduation requirements shall not provide less in the way of requirements in the areas of English, math, science, and social studies as provided in this chapter.\n\n(3) In addition to the required courses, a number of elective courses shall be successfully passed by a student enrolled in grades nine through twelve of public schools prior to such student’s graduation or receipt of a diploma, phased in beginning with students entering the ninth grade in the 1996-97 scholastic year. The State Board of Education shall determine the number and classification of units of credit required for high school graduation.\n\n(f) The State Board of Education, on the recommendation of the State Superintendent of Education, shall prescribe the minimum contents of courses of study for all public elementary and high schools in the state. In every elementary school there shall be taught at least reading including phonics, spelling, handwriting, arithmetic, oral and written English, geography, history of the United States and Alabama, elementary science, hygiene and sanitation, physical education, the arts, including musical and visual arts, environmental protection, and such other studies as may be prescribed by the local board of education. Instruction in handwriting shall include cursive writing so that students are able to create readable documents through legible cursive handwriting by the end of the third grade. Moreover, the State Board of Education shall require the following courses for grades one through eight in all public schools to be phased in beginning with students entering grades one through eight in the 1995-96 scholastic year: English, social studies, mathematics, and science shall be taught each year in grades one through eight. English shall include, but not be limited to, material designed to develop language arts, such as reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. Social studies shall emphasize geography and history of the United States and Alabama.\n\n(g) The State Board of Education shall adopt necessary policies, procedures, rules, regulations, and/or standards to require college and university departments of education to review their existing educational programs for all prospective teachers in order to ensure that they are properly prepared to teach the courses required by law.\n\n(h) The State Board of Education and all local boards shall develop and implement within ninety (90) days of July 7, 1995, a comprehensive character education program for all grades to consist of not less than ten minutes instruction per day focusing upon the students’ development of the following character traits: Courage, patriotism, citizenship, honesty, fairness, respect for others, kindness, cooperation, self-respect, self-control, courtesy, compassion, tolerance, diligence, generosity, punctuality, cleanliness, cheerfulness, school pride, respect for the environment, patience, creativity, sportsmanship, loyalty, and perseverance. Each plan of instruction shall include the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag.\n\n(i) The State Board of Education shall adopt necessary policies, procedures, rules, regulations, and/or standards to ensure quality vocational/technical education programs.\n\n(j) Each local board of education shall certify on an annual basis to the State Board of Education that the applicable schools in the school district are meeting the cursive writing requirements under subsection (f). The State Board of Education may adopt rules to implement this subsection.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, §2; Act 2005-312, 1st Sp. Sess., p. 639, §1; Act 2016-352, §1.)",

The curriculum may include a listing of required credits, courses, competencies, and experiences necessary to earn a diploma though the workforce pathway.\n\n(3) All K-12 students in this state shall earn the same high school diploma, regardless of which diploma pathway they follow; however, students enrolled in the Workforce Pathways diploma pathway shall only be required to complete two math credits and two science credits to earn their high school diploma instead of the four math credits and four science credits required of other students. The State Department of Education shall develop an identifying seal that is to be placed on any high school diploma earned by a student following the workforce pathway.\n\n(4) In lieu of the math and science credits, students enrolled in the Workforce Pathways diploma pathway may earn credits that apply toward graduation by completing career and technical education courses, which help prepare those students to go directly into employment in their chosen field following high school graduation.\n\n(d) The State Department of Education shall work with local boards of education throughout the state to implement the Workforce Pathways diploma pathway at the local level.\n\n(e) Students who earn a diploma through the Workforce Pathway shall be eligible for admission to any postsecondary institution or public university in the state; provided, however, each institution and university shall maintain the ability to set its own admission requirements.\n\n(f) When an alternative assessment is developed for students in the Workforce Pathways diploma pathway, that assessment may be considered in assigning an academic achievement grade to a school or school system.\n\n(g) The State Board of Education may seek additional funding from the Legislature to construct, retrofit, or upgrade career and technical education centers throughout the state so that a career and technical education center is located within a reasonable distance from every high school in the state. While school systems with a larger population of students may need their own career and technical education center, school systems with smaller populations of students may share career and technical education centers.\n\n(h) The Legislature may provide additional funding for the Alabama Short-Term Credential Program that provides scholarships to facilitate the participation of individuals in for-credit and non-credit courses provided through the Alabama Community College System offering training for in-demand careers in the region where the course is taught.\n\n(Act 2024-126, §§1-4.)",

      "text": "Section 16-6B-3\n\nAssistance Programs.\n\n(a) Student strategy. The superintendent of the local board of education along with the staff of each school shall develop an assistance program at each school for at-risk students performing below the standards set by the State Board of Education. The standards shall include the results of the required assessment program adopted by the State Board of Education with emphasis on students who are found to be at one or more grade levels below the prescribed norm. The local board of education shall budget at least one hundred dollars ($100) per student so identified to be expended on tutorial assistance programs including, but not limited to, after-school, Saturday school, or summer school, or any combination of these programs. These funds may be budgeted from state or federal funds. However, federal funds already budgeted for at-risk students may not be counted toward the minimum one hundred dollars ($100) requirement set aside to be expended for at-risk students as defined in this chapter. In addition, these funds may be expended for any of the following purposes:\n\n(1) Programs to encourage at-risk five-year olds to attend an approved preschool program.\n\n(2) Programs to identify at-risk students in the first grade.\n\n(3) Programs to ensure strict enforcement of truancy laws.\n\n(4) Programs to create alternative or disciplinary schools in which children who consistently exhibit behaviors or patterns of behaviors that interfere with the learning environment of other students would be placed and would be provided counseling and instruction in basic skills.\n\n(5) Programs to encourage parental involvement of parents of at-risk children.\n\n(6) Programs to encourage literacy of parents of at-risk children.\n\n(b) School strategy. The State Board of Education shall develop an assistance program for a school in need of assistance. A school in need of assistance shall mean any school which has a majority of its students scoring one or more grade levels below the prescribed norm on the state adopted student assessments. Local superintendents and local boards of education will be expected to make the effort and commit the resources necessary to improve the instructional program for a school in need of assistance and shall be required to budget all funds earned by that school in the cost calculations of the Foundation Program. Local superintendents and local boards of education are encouraged to use assistance from the State Department of Education, colleges of education, accrediting agencies and other sources.\n\nThe State Board of Education’s plan for an assistance program shall consist of the following components:\n\n(1) The faculty and staff of each school in need of assistance shall engage in a self-study to examine the problem of low achievement within that school and shall develop steps which may be taken to improve student achievement. Parents of students in the schools shall be consulted as part of this self-study.\n\n(2) If, after two years, student achievement has not improved, the State Superintendent of Education shall designate a team of practicing professionals to visit the school, conduct a study, consult with parents of students in the school, analyze causes of poor student achievement, and make specific recommendations which shall become a part of a school improvement plan for the succeeding year.\n\n(3) As a final step, when insufficient or no improvement as determined by the State Board of Education is evident from the implementation of steps one and two above, the State Superintendent of Education is required to intervene and to appoint a person or persons to run the day-to-day operation of the school. In considering intervention, the State Board of Education shall consider factors which may have affected the prescribed norm test score. Factors shall include drop-out rates, attendance rates, special education enrollment, and any other data necessary to properly interpret student achievement in each school.\n\n(c) School system strategy. The State Board of Education shall develop an assistance program for a local board of education identified as being in need of assistance. A local board of education in need of assistance shall mean any local board of education which has a majority of its schools, or a majority of the students in a system, in which the students are scoring one or more grade levels below the prescribed norm.\n\nThe State Board of Education shall require a local board of education in need of assistance to do the following:\n\n(1) The local board of education and the local superintendent with input from other administrators, teachers, staff, parents of students in the school, and the local community shall engage in a self-study to examine the problem of low achievement within the system and to develop steps which may be taken to improve student achievement.\n\n(2) If, after two years, student achievement has not improved, the state superintendent shall develop a system-wide school improvement plan in consultation with teachers, parents of students in the school, and the local community. This school improvement plan shall become a part of the local board of education’s program and financial operations for the succeeding year.\n\n(3) If, after the implementation of the school improvement plan, student achievement has not sufficiently improved, relative to the previous year’s performance, the State Board of Education shall require the State Superintendent of Education to intervene and assume the direct management and day-to-day operation of the local board of education for such period of time as may be necessary for student achievement to improve. In considering intervention, the State Board of Education shall consider factors which may have affected the prescribed norm test score. Factors shall include drop-out rates, attendance rates, special education enrollment, and any other data necessary to properly interpret student achievement in each system.\n\n(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that intervention is not to occur when a school or school system scores below the prescribed average. Intervention by the State Board of Education is to occur only after the three-year period provided in this chapter during which a school or school system fails to show improvement. So long as improvement is being shown, the State Board of Education shall not intervene but shall continue to encourage the school to improve.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, §3; Act 2000-753, p. 1705, §1.)",

If during the assistance the State Superintendent of Education determines that the local board of education is in an unsound fiscal position, a person or persons shall be appointed by the State Superintendent of Education to advise the day-to-day financial operations of the local board of education. If after a reasonable period of time the State Superintendent of Education determines that the local board of education is still in an unsound fiscal condition, a request shall be made to the State Board of Education for the direct control of the fiscal operation of the local board of education. If the request is granted, the State Superintendent of Education shall present to the State Board of Education a proposal for the implementation of management controls necessary to restore the local school system to a sound financial condition. Upon approval by the State Board of Education, the State Superintendent of Education shall appoint an individual to be chief financial officer to manage the fiscal operation of the local board of education , until such time as the fiscal condition of the system is restored. The chief financial officer shall perform his or her duties in accordance with rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education in concert with applicable Alabama law. Any person appointed by the State Superintendent of Education to serve as chief financial officer to manage the fiscal operation of a local board of education shall be required to give bond with a surety company authorized to do business in Alabama and shall not be required to receive approval of the local superintendent to expend monies. The chief financial officer shall serve at the pleasure and under the direction of the State Superintendent of Education. The State Superintendent of Education, directly or indirectly through the chief financial officer, may direct or approve such actions as may in his or her judgment be necessary to: (1) Prevent further deterioration in the financial condition of the local board; (2) restore the local board of education to financial stability; and (3) enforce compliance with statutory, regulatory, or other binding legal standards or requirements relating to the fiscal operation of the local board of education.

Finally, as a result of hold harmless and federal requirements of maintenance of effort, no local board shall be permitted to spend fewer state dollars for vocational/technical education than it did during the 1994-95 school year.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, §8; Act 2000-757, p. 1724, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 16-6B-10\n\nBudget Requirements for Foundation and Vocational/Technical Education Program.\n\n(a) Foundation Program. It is the intent of the Legislature to see that funds allocated for classroom instructional support actually reach the classroom. To that end, the State Department of Education shall monitor the flow of funds appropriated for various instructional purposes. Classroom instructional support shall be defined as those funds appropriated for instructional supplies, library enhancement, textbooks, technology and professional development. The Legislature believes that the classroom instructional support funds have a direct impact upon the ability of classroom teachers to have the resources and assistance necessary to assist them in the performance of their responsibilities. School budgets for instructional supplies shall be developed within each school as is required by Section 16-1-30 relating to the adoption of school board policies. It is the intent of the Legislature that teachers shall have direct input in the development of their school’s budget for classroom instructional support and in the expenditure of these funds. The Legislature realizes that teachers and principals cannot be held accountable unless they have the authority to use resources provided them by legislative appropriations. As each school’s budget is developed, local boards of education shall ensure principals and classroom teachers are given the opportunity to participate in decisions concerning the appropriate use and expenditure of classroom instructional support funds. Where the principal or the teachers have not been granted the right to have direct input in the development of their school’s budget or are restrained in the expenditure of instructional supply funds, they may petition the State Superintendent of Education for relief pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the State Department of Education. Because the Legislature believes classroom instructional support funds to be critically important, the following conditions will apply to the budgeting process of each local board of education:\n\n(1) Classroom instructional materials and supplies must be budgeted for all teachers at the rate appropriated per teacher unit by the Legislature in the Foundation Program.\n\n(2) Textbook funds must be budgeted for all students based on the rate appropriated per student by the Legislature in the Foundation Program.\n\n(3) Technology funds must be budgeted for all teachers based on their rate appropriated per teacher unit by the Legislature in the Foundation Program.\n\n(4) Professional development funds must be budgeted for all teachers based on the rate appropriated per teacher unit by the Legislature in the Foundation Program.\n\n(5) Library enhancement funds must be budgeted for all teachers based on the rate appropriated per teacher unit by the Legislature in the Foundation Program. The library enhancement appropriation shall be for K-12 Public School Library/Media Centers and is an absolute appropriation. Expenditures may include books, book binding, repair, CD Roms, computer software, computer equipment, cataloging, audiovisual materials, newspapers, magazines, recordings, and video tapes.\n\n(6) In addition to classroom instructional support, leave (sick and personal) must be budgeted for all teachers based on the number of days and the rate per day used by the Legislature in calculating the cost in the Foundation Program.\n\n(7) The principal of a local school in consultation with the teacher(s) so affected may request a waiver from subdivisions (2) through (5). The waiver shall be presented to the local superintendent of education. Upon concurrence, the local superintendent of education shall request a waiver from the State Superintendent of Education, which application shall be deemed to be granted unless affirmatively rejected in writing by the state superintendent within 30 days of its receipt.\n\n(b) Vocational/Technical Education Program.

The Legislature also finds that excessive and time-consuming reporting requirements levied on school systems requires automation in order to for timely reporting to occur. The Legislature further finds that the excessive paperwork required of teachers has become so burdensome that teachers do not have adequate time to prepare lesson plans or to devote individual attention to those students who require special assistance. The Legislature further finds that, for teachers to have time to teach, it is imperative that all unnecessary paperwork be eliminated from our public schools and necessary paperwork be automated to the maximum practical extent.\n\n(b) The Paperwork Reduction Committee is created. The membership of the committee shall consist of twenty persons as follows:\n\n(1) Ten members appointed by the Governor, including the chair of the committee and at least five members who are administrators or supervisors in a public school system. The chair of the committee shall call a meeting of the committee within 15 calendar days after June 11, 2001, and the committee shall determine rules and begin deliberations.\n\n(2) Ten persons appointed by the Executive Secretary of the Alabama Education Association.\n\n(c) The terms of office of the members of the committee shall commence on July 1, 2001, and continue through January 31, 2002. Thereafter, a new committee shall be appointed at the beginning of any new gubernatorial administration to serve from July 1 through March 31 of the year following appointment.\n\n(d)(1) The committee shall study the paperwork required of public school employees and prepare a report on how to reduce and automate that paperwork.\n\n(2) The State Department of Education shall provide all necessary assistance, including clerical support, to the committee in order for the committee to perform its work.\n\n(3) The State Superintendent of Education shall timely provide any information, reports, and documents to the committee from the State Department of Education and any local board of education, as requested by the committee.\n\n(4) The report or reports of the committee and any recommendations of the committee shall be delivered to the State Superintendent of Education and the Legislative Council not later than the first day of the applicable regular session of the Legislature.\n\n(5) Any action or inaction by the State Superintendent of Education, any local board of education, or any local superintendent of education in implementing the prior recommendations of the committee shall be reported in writing by the committee to the Legislative Council.\n\n(6) Upon the recommendation of the committee, the Legislative Council may require that further paperwork reduction and automation be implemented by the State Superintendent of Education and local education officials, if not in conflict with this code or the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.\n\n(7) The State Superintendent of Education shall expeditiously implement the recommendations of the Legislative Council.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-313, p. 620, p. 629, §11, Act 2001-475, p. 636, §1.)",
