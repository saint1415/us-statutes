Failure by the tag agent to disburse within such 20 day period shall result in a forfeiture of such administrative fee plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Code Section48-2-40.(3)Beginning July 1, 2019, the portion of the title ad valorem tax fee proceeds to be retained by the county pursuant to division (b)(1)(B)(iii) of this Code section shall be distributed as follows:(A)The tag agent of the county shall within 20 days following the end of each calendar month allocate and distribute to the water and sewerage authority for which the county has levied an ad valorem tax in accordance with a local constitutional amendment, and in a county in which a sales and use tax is levied for purposes of a metropolitan area system of public transportation, as authorized by the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, the governing body of the transportation authority created by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965, Ga. L. 1965, p. 2243, as amended, and the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, an amount of those proceeds necessary to offset any reduction in:(i)Ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles collected under Chapter 5 of this title on behalf of such water and sewerage authority during calendar year 2012; and(ii)With respect to the transportation authority, the monthly average portion of the sales and use tax levied for purposes of a metropolitan area system of public transportation applicable to any motor vehicle titled in a county which levied such tax in 2012.Such amount of tax under division (ii) of this subparagraph may be determined by the commissioner for counties which levied such tax in 2012, and in any counties which subsequently levy a tax pursuant to a metropolitan area system of public transportation, as authorized by the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, the governing body of the transportation authority created by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965, Ga. L. 1965, p. 2243, as amended, and the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, the commissioner may determine what amount of sales and use tax would have been collected in calendar year 2012, had such tax been levied. The amount of the reduction to be offset under this subparagraph with respect to division (i) of this subparagraph shall be calculated by the county governing authority by subtracting the amount of title ad valorem tax on motor vehicles collected under Chapter 5 of this title on behalf of such water and sewerage authority in the current calendar month from one-twelfth of the amount of such ad valorem tax on motor vehicles collected on behalf of such water and sewerage authority in calendar year 2012. The amount of the reduction to be offset under this subparagraph with respect to division (ii) of this subparagraph shall be calculated by the county governing authority by subtracting the amount of sales tax collected or determined to have been collected on such motor vehicles by the state revenue commissioner in the current calendar month in any such county from one-twelfth of the amount of sales and use tax collected, or determined to have been collected, on such motor vehicles, by the state revenue commissioner in calendar year 2012 in such county. In the event that the local title ad valorem tax proceeds are insufficient to offset fully such reduction in ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles or the portion of the sales and use tax described in division (ii) of this subparagraph, the tag agent shall allocate a proportionate amount of the proceeds to such water and sewerage authority and the transportation authority, as appropriate, and any remaining shortfall shall be paid from the following month's local title ad valorem tax fee proceeds. In the event that a shortfall remains, the tag agent shall continue to first allocate local title ad valorem tax fee proceeds to offset such shortfalls until the shortfall has been fully repaid;(B)As to the proceeds remaining after the distribution provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, with regard to the proceeds associated with and collected on motor vehicle titles for motor vehicles registered in the unincorporated areas of the county, the tag agent of the county shall within 20 days following the end of each calendar month allocate and distribute 51 percent of such proceeds to the county governing authority and distribute 49 percent of such proceeds to the board of education of the county school district; and(C)As to the proceeds remaining after the distribution provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, with regard to the proceeds associated with and collected on motor vehicle titles for motor vehicles registered in the incorporated areas of the county, the tag agent of the county shall within 20 days following the end of each calendar month allocate such proceeds by the municipality from which the proceeds were derived and then, for each such municipality, distribute 23 percent of such proceeds to the county governing authority and 28 percent of such proceeds to the governing authority of such municipality, and the remaining 49 percent of such proceeds shall be distributed to the board of education of the county school district; provided, however, that, if there is an independent school district in such municipality, then 23 percent of such proceeds shall be distributed to the county governing authority and 34 percent of such proceeds shall be distributed to the governing authority of such municipality and the remaining 43 percent of such proceeds shall be distributed to the board of education of the independent school district.(d)(1)(A)Upon the death of an owner of a motor vehicle which has not become subject to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section, the immediate family member or immediate family members of such owner who receive such motor vehicle pursuant to a will or under the rules of inheritance shall, subsequent to the transfer of title of such motor vehicle, continue to be subject to ad valorem tax under Chapter 5 of this title and shall not be subject to the state and local title ad valorem tax fees provided for in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section unless the immediate family member or immediate family members make an affirmative written election to become subject to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section.

Laws 716, § 4-1.\n\nSuch amount of tax under division (ii) of this subparagraph may be determined by the commissioner for counties which levied such tax in 2012, and in any counties which subsequently levy a tax pursuant to a metropolitan area system of public transportation, as authorized by the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, the governing body of the transportation authority created by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965, Ga. L. 1965, p. 2243, as amended, and the amendment to the Constitution set out at Ga. L. 1964, p. 1008, the commissioner may determine what amount of sales and use tax would have been collected in calendar year 2012, had such tax been levied. The amount of the reduction to be offset under this subparagraph with respect to division (i) of this subparagraph shall be calculated by the county governing authority by subtracting the amount of title ad valorem tax on motor vehicles collected under Chapter 5 of this title on behalf of such water and sewerage authority in the current calendar month from one-twelfth of the amount of such ad valorem tax on motor vehicles collected on behalf of such water and sewerage authority in calendar year 2012. The amount of the reduction to be offset under this subparagraph with respect to division (ii) of this subparagraph shall be calculated by the county governing authority by subtracting the amount of sales tax collected or determined to have been collected on such motor vehicles by the state revenue commissioner in the current calendar month in any such county from one-twelfth of the amount of sales and use tax collected, or determined to have been collected, on such motor vehicles, by the state revenue commissioner in calendar year 2012 in such county. In the event that the local title ad valorem tax proceeds are insufficient to offset fully such reduction in ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles or the portion of the sales and use tax described in division (ii) of this subparagraph, the tag agent shall allocate a proportionate amount of the proceeds to such water and sewerage authority and the transportation authority, as appropriate, and any remaining shortfall shall be paid from the following month's local title ad valorem tax fee proceeds. In the event that a shortfall remains, the tag agent shall continue to first allocate local title ad valorem tax fee proceeds to offset such shortfalls until the shortfall has been fully repaid;\n\nshall be required to pay state and local title ad valorem tax fees in an amount equal to 3 percent of the fair market value of the motor vehicle.\n\nUpon certification by the tag agent of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph, such motor vehicle shall not be subject to ad valorem tax as otherwise required under Chapter 5 of this title in the same manner as otherwise provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Code section.\n\nAmended by 2024 Ga.
