In the event a county expending less than the amount distributed to it certifies at the time of the submission of its audit or within a reasonable time thereafter that it is accumulating the unexpended funds for a specified allowable purpose and submits proof of the deposit or investment of the funds, the county shall be deemed to have complied with this subsection, except that the amount of the unexpended funds shall be added to the amount of funds distributed to the county in the next succeeding year or years for the purpose of making the comparison and determination provided in this Code section. Upon the request of the Governor or the commissioner of transportation, the state auditor may audit the books and records of each county to verify the accuracy of the audits filed with him and to ensure that the expenditure of the funds has been made for the purposes intended.(2)The procedure provided in this subsection shall apply to any grants to counties under any provision of law from motor fuel tax funds.(3)The Secretary of State shall mail a copy of this subsection to the chairman and the clerk of the governing authority of each county.(c)The Office of the State Treasurer shall pay to each county the amount provided in this Code section in 12 equal monthly installments. The amount necessary to make each monthly payment to the proper officials of the various counties is appropriated for the purpose and made a special and continuing appropriation.(d)If the Office of Planning and Budget fails to make available for any quarter of a fiscal year a sum sufficient to pay in full the appropriation provided in subsection (c) of this Code section, the distribution of funds to the counties for that quarter shall be on the basis existing prior to January 1, 1979.
