      "text": "Section 41-22-2\n\nLegislative Intent and Purpose; Effect on Substantive Rights; Applicability; Rulemaking Authority.\n\n(a) This chapter is intended to provide a minimum procedural code for the operation of all state agencies when they take action affecting the rights and duties of the public. Nothing in this chapter is meant to discourage agencies from adopting procedures conferring additional rights upon the public; and, save for express provisions of this act to the contrary, nothing in this chapter is meant to abrogate in whole or in part any statute prescribing procedural duties for an agency which are in addition to those provided herein.\n\n(b)(1) The purposes of the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act are to accomplish all of the following:\n\na. Provide legislative oversight of powers and duties delegated to administrative agencies.\n\nb. Increase public accountability of administrative agencies.\n\nc. Simplify government by assuring a uniform minimum procedure to which all agencies will be held in the conduct of their most important functions.\n\nd. Increase public access to governmental information.\n\ne. Increase public participation in the formulation of administrative rules.\n\nf. Increase the fairness of agencies in their conduct of contested case proceedings.\n\ng. Simplify the process of judicial review of agency action as well as increase its ease and availability.\n\n(2) In accomplishing its objectives, the intention of this chapter is to strike a fair balance between these purposes and the need for efficient, economical, and effective government administration.\n\n(c) This chapter is not meant to alter the substantive rights of any person or agency. Its impact is limited to procedural rights with the expectation that better substantive results will be achieved in the everyday conduct of state government by improving the process by which those results are attained.\n\n(d) Every state agency having express statutory authority to adopt rules shall be governed by this chapter and any additional provisions required by statute, and shall also have the authority to amend or repeal rules, and to prescribe methods and procedures required in connection therewith. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as granting to any agency the authority to adopt rules.\n\n(e) All agencies whose rules or administrative decisions are subject to approval by the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Department of Insurance of the State of Alabama are exempted from this chapter.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-855, p. 1534, §2; Act 2019-498, §1.)",

Date of publication in the Alabama Administrative Monthly shall constitute the date of notice. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, the notice shall state whether the proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of the rule relates to or affects in any manner any litigation which the agency is a party to concerning the subject matter of the proposed rule. The notice shall include a statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects and issues involved, shall specify a notice period ending not less than 35 days or more than 90 days from the date of the notice, during which period interested persons may present their views, and shall specify the place where, and the manner in which, interested persons may present their views. The notice shall be given to the chair of the committee, as provided in Section 41-22-23, and mailed to all persons who pay the cost of the mailing and who have made timely request of the agency for advance notice of its rulemaking proceedings and shall be published, prior to any action, in the Alabama Administrative Monthly. A complete copy of the proposed rule shall be filed with the secretary of the agency and the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division.\n\n(2) Afford all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in writing. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule. Upon adoption of a rule, the agency, if conflicting views are submitted on the proposed rule, shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption, incorporating therein its reasons for overruling any considerations urged against its adoption.\n\n(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, if an agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires adoption of a rule upon fewer than 35 days’ notice or that action is required by or to comply with a federal statute or regulation which requires adoption of a rule upon fewer than 35 days’ notice and states in writing its reasons for that finding to the committee, the agency may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable, to adopt an emergency rule. The rule shall become effective immediately, unless otherwise stated in the rule, upon the filing of the rule and a copy of the written statement of the reasons therefor with the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division, and the secretary of the agency. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days and shall not be renewable.\n\n(2) An agency shall not adopt the same or a substantially similar emergency rule within one calendar year from its first adoption unless the agency clearly establishes it could not reasonably be foreseen during the initial 120-day period that such emergency would continue or would likely reoccur during the next nine months. The adoption of the same or a substantially similar rule by normal rulemaking procedures is not precluded. In any subsequent action contesting the effective date of a rule adopted pursuant to this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the agency to justify its finding.\n\n(3) Prior to indexing and publication, the agency shall make reasonable efforts to apprise the persons who may be affected by its rules of the adoption of the emergency rule. An emergency rule shall be strictly construed and shall not be valid except to the extent necessary to prevent, mitigate, or resolve immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.\n\n(c) It is the intent of this section to establish basic minimum procedural requirements for the adoption, amendment, or repeal of administrative rules. Except for emergency rules which are provided for in subsection (b), this section is applicable to the exercise of any rulemaking authority conferred by any statute, but nothing in this section repeals or diminishes additional requirements imposed by law or diminishes or repeals any summary power granted by law to the state or any agency thereof.\n\n(d) No rule adopted after October 1, 1982, is valid unless adopted in substantial compliance with this section. A proceeding to contest any rule on the ground of noncompliance with the procedural requirements of this section must be commenced within two years from the effective date of the rule; provided, however, that a proceeding to contest a rule based on failure to provide notice as required in this section may be commenced at any time.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-855, p. 1534, §5; Acts 1993, No. 93-627, p. 1051, §1; Act 2015-291, p. 896, §1; Act 2018-139, §1; Act 2019-498, §1.)",

At a minimum, when the agency files the notice of intent, the agency shall post the text of the rule the agency proposes to adopt, amend, or repeal on its website or, if the agency has no website, on a website operated or maintained by the executive branch. Additionally, when the agency files a notice of intent to adopt, amend, or repeal a rule, the agency shall electronically notify any person who has registered with the agency his or her desire to receive notification of any proposal by the agency to adopt, amend, or repeal a rule.\n\n(c) If, prior to the end of the notice period, a business notifies an agency that it will be negatively impacted by an action proposed under subsection (b), the agency shall prepare and submit to the committee the information provided by the affected business as well as a business impact analysis of the proposed action. The analysis shall estimate the number of businesses subject to the agency’s proposal as well as the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other administrative costs required for compliance with the proposal. An agency shall prepare the business impact analysis using information available to the agency in the normal course of business and utilizing the expertise and experience of existing agency employees.\n\n(d) After receiving a business impact analysis from an agency, the committee may require the agency to analyze and report to the committee the feasibility of some or all of the following methods of reducing the impact of the rule on businesses:\n\n(1) The establishment of less stringent compliance or reporting requirements for businesses.\n\n(2) The establishment of less stringent schedules or deadlines for compliance or reporting requirements for businesses.\n\n(3) The consolidation or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements for businesses.\n\n(4) The establishment of performance standards for businesses to replace design or operational standards required in the rule.\n\n(e) The agency shall state in the business impact analysis whether the proposed rule is proposed as a result of a requirement issued by a federal agency. If so, the agency shall submit information identifying the specific requirement issued by the federal agency.\n\n(f) A business impact analysis required to be filed pursuant to this section shall be filed with the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division, at the same time as the certified rule is filed and shall be available for public inspection.\n\n(g) Each agency that files a business impact analysis, at the time it is filed, shall place that statement on its website in a location that is easily accessible by the general public, or, if the agency does not have a website, on a website operated or maintained by the executive branch.\n\n(h) If the committee determines that an agency or a division of an agency exists primarily to perform certification or licensing-related functions, the agency is not required to comply with this section unless the committee determines in writing that an agency’s proposal has such a negative impact on businesses that the filing of a business impact analysis is warranted. Notwithstanding subsection (c) of Section 41-22-6, which provides that a rule is effective 45 days after notice that the agency filed the certified rule with the Legislative Services Agency, Legal Division, is published in the Alabama Administrative Monthly, in any case in which the committee determines that the filing of a business impact analysis is warranted as provided in this section, the effective date of the rule shall be 45 additional days after the effective date specified in subsection (c) of Section 41-22-6. In all other respects, the remainder of this chapter shall continue to apply to the proposed rule.\n\n(i) An agency or department shall fulfill any request for license or permit within 28 calendar days after receiving the application or notify the applicant of the reason for failure to issue the license or permit.\n\n(j) An agency is not required to comply with this section if the proposed rule is being adopted in order for the agency to comply with membership requirements in a multi-state or national membership organization.\n\n(k) This section shall not apply to the adoption of an emergency rule adopted pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 41-22-5.\n\n(Act 2013-88, p. 188, §§1, 2; Act 2015-291, p. 896, §1; Act 2019-498, §1.)",

When necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible of proof under those rules, evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted (except where precluded by statute) if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Agencies shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Except as hereinafter provided, objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Whenever any evidence is excluded as inadmissible, all such evidence existing in written form shall remain a part of the record as an offer of proof. The party seeking the admission of oral testimony may make an offer of proof by means of a brief statement on the record describing the testimony excluded. All rulings on the admissibility of evidence shall be final and shall appear in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a hearing will be expedited and interests of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be received or may be required to be submitted in verified form; provided, the adversary party shall not be denied the right of cross-examination of the witness. The testimony of parties and witnesses shall be made under oath. Provided, however, in the hearing of a contested case where judicial review of the case is by trial de novo, the agency may announce that it shall not be necessary that objections be made during the hearing and upon such announcement, it shall not be required or necessary that objection to be made to any testimony or evidence which may be offered by either party, and on the consideration of such cases the agency shall consider only such testimony and evidence as is relevant, material, competent and legal, and shall not consider any testimony or evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, incompetent or illegal, whether objection shall have been made thereto or not, and whether such testimony be brought out on direct, cross or re-direct examination, or is hearsay. The agency shall not be required to point out what testimony or evidence should be excluded or not considered. Either party, on submission, shall have the privilege of calling attention to any testimony or evidence which is deemed objectionable. If specific objection be made to any evidence and a ruling made thereon by the agency, this exception shall not apply to such evidence.\n\n(2) Documentary evidence otherwise admissible may be received in the form of copies or excerpts, or by incorporation by reference to material already on file with the agency. Upon request, parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original.\n\n(3) A party may conduct cross-examination required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, except as may otherwise be limited by law.\n\n(4) Official notice may be taken of all facts of which judicial notice may be taken and of other scientific and technical facts within the specialized knowledge of the agency. Parties shall be notified at the earliest practicable time, either before or during the hearing, or by reference in preliminary reports, preliminary decisions or otherwise, of the facts proposed to be noticed and their source, including any staff memoranda or data, and the parties shall be afforded an opportunity to contest such facts before the decision is announced unless the agency determines as part of the record or decision that fairness to the parties does not require an opportunity to contest such facts.\n\n(5) The experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-855, p. 1534, §13; Acts 1986, No. 86-472, p. 880, §1.)",

A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy.\n\n(b) All proceedings for review may be instituted by filing of notice of appeal or review and a cost bond with the agency to cover the reasonable costs of preparing the transcript of the proceeding under review, unless waived by the agency or the court on a showing of substantial hardship. A petition shall be filed either in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County or in the circuit court of the county in which the agency maintains its headquarters, or unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, in the circuit court of the county where a party other than an intervenor, resides or if a party, other than an intervenor, is a corporation, domestic or foreign, having a registered office or business office in this state, then in the county of the registered office or principal place of business within this state.\n\n(c) The filing of the notice of appeal or the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the agency decision.

In all other cases, the agency may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms, but, in any event, the order shall specify the conditions upon which the stay or supersedeas is granted; provided, however, if the appeal or proceedings for review to any reviewing court is from an order of the agency increasing or reducing or refusing to increase rates, fares, or charges, or any of them, or any schedule or parts of any schedule of rates, fares, or charges, the reviewing court shall not direct or order a supersedeas or stay of the action or order to be reviewed without requiring, as a condition precedent to the granting of such supersedeas, that the party applying for supersedeas or stay shall execute and file with the clerk of the court a bond as provided for and required by statute or law. If the circuit court shall fail or refuse to grant supersedeas or stay, the party seeking such relief may petition the appropriate court to which the appeal or review lies to order a supersedeas or stay of the action or order of the agency from which review is sought. After the required bond shall have been filed and approved by the clerk, such agency order shall be stayed and superseded, and it shall be lawful to charge the rates, fares, or charges which have been reduced, refused, or denied by the agency order, until the final disposition of the cause. The provisions of this subsection shall apply when applicable, anything in Rule 60 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure restricting the provisions of this subsection to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n(d) The notice of appeal or review shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt of the notice of or other service of the final decision of the agency upon the petitioner or, if a rehearing is requested under Section 41-22-17, within 30 days after the receipt of the notice of or other service of the decision of the agency thereon. The petition for judicial review in the circuit court shall be filed within 30 days after the filing of the notice of appeal or review. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record. Any person aggrieved who is not a party may petition to become a party by filing a motion to intervene as provided in Section 41-22-14. Failure to file such petition within the time stated shall operate as a waiver of the right of such person to review under this chapter, except that for good cause shown, the judge of the reviewing court may extend the time for filing, not to exceed an additional 30 days, or, within four months after the issuance of the agency order, issue an order permitting a review of the agency decision under this chapter notwithstanding such waiver.

This section shall apply to judicial review from the final order or action of all agencies, and amends the judicial review statutes relating to all agencies to provide a period of 30 days within which to appeal or to institute judicial review.\n\n(e) If there has been no hearing prior to agency action and the reviewing court finds that the validity of the action depends upon disputed facts, the court shall order the agency to conduct a prompt fact-finding proceeding under this chapter after having a reasonable opportunity to reconsider its determination on the record of the proceedings.\n\n(f) Unreasonable delay on the part of an agency in reaching a final decision shall be justification for any person whose rights, duties, or privileges are adversely affected by such delay to seek a court order compelling action by the agency.\n\n(g) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of appeal or within such additional time as the court may allow, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record and transcript of the proceedings under review. With the permission of the court, the record of the proceedings under review may be shortened by stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings. Any party found by the reviewing court to have unreasonably refused to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for such additional costs as may be occasioned by the refusal. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable.\n\n(h) The petition for review shall name the agency as respondent and shall contain a concise statement of:\n\n(1) The nature of the agency action which is the subject of the petition;\n\n(2) The particular agency action appealed from;\n\n(3) The facts and law on which jurisdiction and venue are based;\n\n(4) The grounds on which relief is sought; and\n\n(5) The relief sought.\n\n(i) In proceedings for judicial review of agency action in a contested case, except where appeal or judicial review is by a trial de novo, a reviewing court shall not itself hear or accept any further evidence with respect to those issues of fact whose determination was entrusted by law to the agency in that contested case proceeding; provided, however, that evidence may be introduced in the reviewing court as to fraud or misconduct of some person engaged in the administration of the agency or procedural irregularities before the agency not shown in the record and the affecting order, ruling, or award from which review is sought, and proof thereon may be taken in the reviewing court. If, before the date set for hearing a petition for judicial review of agency action in a contested case, it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the contested case proceeding before the agency, the court may remand to the agency and order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision in the case by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modification, new findings, or decision with the reviewing court and mail copies of the new findings, or decision to all parties.\n\n(j) The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and, except as herein provided, shall in the review of contested cases be confined to the record and the additions thereto as may be made under subsection (i) of this section. Judicial review shall be by trial de novo in the circuit court where review is sought from tax assessments, tax determinations or tax redeterminations, rulings of the Revenue Department granting, denying, or revoking licenses, or rulings on petitions for tax refunds, or, unless a subsequent agency statute provides otherwise, where an agency statute existing on the effective date of Act No. 81-855, 1981 Acts of Alabama, or thereafter enacted provides for a trial de novo on appeal to or review by the courts; provided, however, in the review of tax assessments, tax determinations, or tax redeterminations, rulings of the Revenue Department granting, denying, or revoking licenses, or rulings on petitions for tax refunds, the administrative record and transcript shall be transmitted to the reviewing court as provided in subsection (g) of this section, and, on motion of either party, shall be admitted into evidence in the trial de novo, subject to the rights of either party to assign errors, objections, or motions to exclude calling attention to any testimony or evidence in the administrative record or transcript which is deemed objectionable or inadmissible. Provided further that, with the consent of all parties, judicial review may be on the administrative record and transcript. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.\n\n(k) Except where judicial review is by trial de novo, the agency order shall be taken as prima facie just and reasonable and the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, except where otherwise authorized by statute. The court may affirm the agency action or remand the case to the agency for taking additional testimony and evidence or for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision or grant other appropriate relief from the agency action, equitable or legal, including declaratory relief, if the court finds that the agency action is due to be set aside or modified under standards set forth in appeal or review statutes applicable to that agency or if substantial rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the agency action is any one or more of the following:\n\n(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\n\n(2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\n\n(3) In violation of any pertinent agency rule;\n\n(4) Made upon unlawful procedure;\n\n(5) Affected by other error of law;\n\n(6) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\n\n(7) Unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion or a clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(l) Unless the court affirms the decision of the agency, the court shall set out in writing, which writing shall become a part of the record, the reasons for its decision.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-855, p. 1534, §20; Acts 1986, No. 86-472, p. 880, §1; Acts 1993, No. 93-627, p. 1051, §1.)",

The form of the proposed rule presented to the committee shall be as follows: New language shall be underlined and language to be deleted shall be typed and lined through.\n\n(b)(1) Within the 45-day period between the date of publication in the Alabama Administrative Monthly that a rule has been certified and the date it becomes effective, and subject to subsection (h) of Section 41-22-5.1, the committee shall study all proposed rules and may hold public hearings. The committee may adopt a policy providing when a public hearing will be held on a rule meeting specified criteria.

The rule shall be reinstated on adjournment of that regular session unless the Legislature, by joint resolution, sustains the disapproval.\n\n(c) The committee may propose an amendment to any proposed rule and return it to the agency with the suggested amendment. In the event the agency accepts the rule as amended, the agency may resubmit the rule as amended to the committee and the rule shall become effective on the date specified in the rule, or on the date the amended rule is submitted, whichever is later. In the event the agency does not accept the amendment, the proposed amended rule shall be deemed disapproved, as provided in subsection (b).\n\n(d) An agency may withdraw a proposed or certified rule.

A state agency shall cooperate and provide information to the committee. At a minimum, the fiscal note submitted with a proposed rule shall include the following:\n\n(1) A determination of the need for the rule and the expected benefit of the rule.\n\n(2) A determination of the costs and benefits associated with the rule and an explanation of why the rule is considered to be the most cost effective, efficient, and feasible means for allocating public and private resources and for achieving the stated purpose.\n\n(3) The effect of the rule on competition.\n\n(4) The effect of the rule on the cost of living and doing business in the geographical area in which the rule would be implemented.\n\n(5) The effect of the rule on employment in the geographical area in which the rule would be implemented.\n\n(6) The source of revenue to be used for implementing and enforcing the rule.\n\n(7) A conclusion on the short-term and long-term economic impact upon all persons substantially affected by the rule, including an analysis containing a description of which persons will bear the costs of the rule and which persons will benefit directly and indirectly from the rule.\n\n(8) The uncertainties associated with the estimation of particular benefits and burdens and the difficulties involved in the comparison of qualitatively and quantitatively dissimilar benefits and burdens. A determination of the need for the rule shall consider qualitative and quantitative benefits and burdens.\n\n(9) The effect of the rule on the environment and public health.\n\n(10) The detrimental effect on the environment and public health if the rule is not implemented.\n\n(g) In determining whether to approve or disapprove proposed rules, the committee shall consider the following criteria:\n\n(1) Is there a statutory authority for the proposed rule?\n\n(2) Would the absence of the rule or rules significantly harm or endanger the public health, safety, or welfare?\n\n(3) Is there a reasonable relationship between the state’s police power and the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare?\n\n(4) Is there another, less restrictive method of regulation available that could adequately protect the public?\n\n(5) Does the rule or do the rules have the effect of directly or indirectly increasing the costs of any goods or services involved and, if so, to what degree?\n\n(6) Is the increase in cost, if any, more harmful to the public than the harm that might result from the absence of the rule or rules?\n\n(7) Are all facets of the rulemaking process designed solely for the purpose of, and so they have, as their primary effect, the protection of the public?\n\n(8) Any other criteria the committee may deem appropriate.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-855, p. 1534, §23; Acts 1986, No. 86-472, p. 880, §1; Acts 1993, No. 93-627, p. 1051, §1; Act 2001-306, p. 376, §1; Act 2001-309, p. 385, §1; Act 2014-457, p. 1757, §1; Act 2015-291, p. 898, §2; Act 2015-527, 1st Sp.
