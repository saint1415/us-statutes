      "text": "Section 41-6A-2\n\nLegislative Intent.\n\nThe Legislature finds that the development, management and efficient use of energy resources and the conservation of energy is of prime importance in an era of rising costs, foreign dependence and uncertain supplies. At the same time it is also important to protect the economic, social and environmental values of the citizens of the state. Such responsibilities require a comprehensive, coordinated capacity on the part of the state to respond to the needs and demands of her citizens. It is therefore the intent of the Legislature:\n\n(1) To ensure the wise development and efficient use of traditional energy sources;\n\n(2) To encourage and assist the development, the use of renewable energy resources, demonstration, and placement in the marketplace of viable, alternative energy sources, more efficient uses of energy sources and other appropriate technology;\n\n(3) To encourage the conservation and efficient use of all energy resources and to provide a governmental environment which will encourage and promote private investment and initiative in the development of new energy resources and more efficient use of all energy resources;\n\n(4) To provide information to the public relating to energy saving uses, designs and construction methods and techniques for all new and existing buildings;\n\n(5) To increase the ability of state government to respond in an efficient, comprehensive and coordinated manner to energy problems which may arise;\n\n(6) To assure, as far as practicable, an energy supply adequate to protect the economic, social and environmental values the state’s citizens now enjoy;\n\n(7) To promote the identification of specifically designed energy management technologies;\n\n(8) To disseminate information about such technologies;\n\n(9) To promote the acceptance and adoption of such technologies by all energy-consuming sectors of the state’s economy; and\n\n(10) That the state shall not enter into the production or distribution of energy in any form.\n\n(Acts 1980, No. 80-449, p. 696, §2.)",
