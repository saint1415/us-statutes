The State Treasurer may impose increased collateral-pledging requirements under this subsection pursuant to generally applicable rules and guidelines adopted by the board of directors or by entering orders applicable to individual qualified public depositories in accordance with criteria and conditions approved by the board of directors, or both. In the event the State Treasurer issues an order establishing an increased collateral-pledging level applicable to a particular qualified public depository, the State Treasurer shall promptly notify the affected qualified public depository in writing.\n\n(d) The State Treasurer may impose higher collateral-pledging requirements on a qualified public depository to the extent that the public deposits maintained by the qualified public depository exceed a specified percentage (the “designated concentration level”) established by the board of directors by rule or regulation of the total public deposits held in all qualified public depositories, in which event each affected qualified public depository shall maintain a collateral-pledging level as follows:\n\n(1) With respect to the qualified public depository’s net average daily balance of public deposits that do not exceed the designated concentration level, the collateral-pledging requirement shall be determined under subsections (b) or (c) above, as applicable.\n\n(2) With respect to the qualified public depository’s net average daily balance of public deposits that exceed the designated concentration level, the collateral-pledging requirement shall be the percentage of net average daily balances of public deposits designated by the board.\n\nDetermination of whether any qualified public depository maintains collateral in excess of the designated concentration level shall be made by the State Treasurer on the basis of the net average monthly balance of public deposits during the immediately preceding 12-month period.\n\n(e) Deposits of eligible collateral shall be made with a custodian in accordance with procedures established by the State Treasurer, including procedures relating to the execution of documentation to assure that the State Treasurer, on behalf of the Loss Payment Fund, will be able to liquidate collateral deposited by each qualified public depository in the event of a loss to public depositors. Each custodian shall be approved by the State Treasurer in accordance with rules, regulations, or guidelines adopted by the board of directors and the laws of this state.\n\nA qualified public depository may not accept or retain any public deposits which are required to be secured unless it has first deposited eligible collateral equal to or exceeding its required collateral pursuant to this chapter. During any month, a qualified public depository may not accept any public deposit that would increase its net average daily balance of public deposits for that month by 25 percent over the net average daily balance of public deposits for the previously reported month unless it deposits or has on deposit additional required collateral to secure such increase and reports such additional collateral to the State Treasurer prior to the acceptance of such deposit.\n\n(f) Collateral shall be valued in such manner as shall be established in rules or regulations adopted by the board of directors, provided that valuations may not be required more frequently than monthly for any qualified public depositories other than in the case of depositories which are then subject to any suspension, disqualification, or cease and desist order under this chapter. Withdrawals and substitutions of collateral pledged by qualified public depositories shall not be permitted without the approval of the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall adopt rules, regulations, or guidelines to permit qualified public depositories to withdraw collateral pledged under this chapter by substituting other eligible collateral of at least equal market value. Any qualified public depository that withdraws or substitutes collateral or custodian that permits withdrawal or substitution of collateral in violation of this chapter shall be subject to the penalties provided in subdivision (3) of subsection (e) of Section 41-14A-7.\n\n(g) A custodian holding collateral under this chapter shall hold such collateral for the benefit of the Loss Payment Fund. The security interest of the Loss Payment Fund in collateral placed with a custodian shall be deemed automatically perfected under the provisions of Articles 8 and 9 of Title 7, as of the date of the acceptance of the deposit of the collateral with the custodian or any subagent of the custodian without the necessity of further action on the part of the Loss Payment Fund. Prior to a default by a qualified public depository and the institution of action by the State Treasurer to enforce the security interest of the Loss Payment Fund under this chapter, the qualified public depository shall not be deemed to have transferred ownership of any pledged collateral to the State Treasurer or the Loss Payment Fund but the qualified public depository’s ownership of the pledged collateral shall be subject to a valid and enforceable lien and security interest in favor of the Loss Payment Fund. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this chapter by the State Treasurer of any collateral pledged to the Loss Payment Fund shall, when the sale is made and the purchase price paid, have the effect of transferring to and vesting in the purchaser of such sale title to the said bonds or other securities comprising such collateral and as authorizing the said purchaser to have the bonds or other securities so purchased registered in the name of the purchaser or its nominee.\n\n(Act 2000-748, p. 1669, §1.)",

The State Treasurer shall have the authority to require that qualified public depositories violating this chapter or any of the board’s standards, rules, regulations, and orders make restitution, with interest at the legal rate, for losses of public depositors or to the Loss Payment Fund, and to issue cease and desist orders against any qualified public depository violating or believed to be violating any provisions of this chapter or any of the board of directors’ or the State Treasurer’s standards, rules, regulations, and orders pursuant to this chapter and to impose administrative penalties against any qualified public depository violating any cease and desist order issued by the State Treasurer.\n\n(b) The suspension or disqualification of a financial institution as a qualified public depository shall be by order of the State Treasurer, and such order shall be mailed to the qualified public depository by registered or certified mail. Within the time and in the manner specified in the order of suspension or disqualification, the financial institution shall provide to the State Treasurer a report listing the names and addresses of each public depositor having public deposits with the financial institution and such other relevant information as the State Treasurer may request, and the State Treasurer shall provide for the prompt notification to each public depositor having public deposits with a suspended or disqualified financial institution of any such suspension or disqualification.\n\n(c) The procedures for suspension or disqualification shall be as set forth in Chapter 22 of this title, and in the rules of the board of directors adopted pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(d) Whenever the State Treasurer determines that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare exists, the board may take any appropriate action that may be available under the provisions of Chapter 22 of this title.\n\n(e) If the State Treasurer finds that one or more grounds exist for the suspension or disqualification of a qualified public depository, the State Treasurer, in lieu of such suspension or disqualification, may impose an administrative penalty upon the qualified public depository as follows:\n\n(1) With respect to any nonwillful violation, such penalty, exclusive of any restitution found to be due, may not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250) for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate penalty for any continuing violation under this subdivision shall be five thousand dollars ($5,000) irrespective of the number of days the violation continues prior to the assessment of the penalty.\n\n(2) With respect to any knowing and willful violation of a lawful order or rule, including, without limitation, the failure to make restitution in accordance with a lawful order of the State Treasurer following notification to the qualified public depository, the State Treasurer may impose a penalty upon the qualified public depository in an amount not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate penalty for any single continuing violation under this subdivision shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) irrespective of the number of days the violation continues prior to the assessment of the penalty.\n\n(3) A qualified public depository or custodian that violates subsection (f) of Section 41-14A-5 is subject to an administrative penalty in an amount not exceeding the greater of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or 10 percent of the amount of withdrawal, not exceeding twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in the aggregate.\n\n(4) If any qualified public depository or other financial institution violates a cease and desist order, the State Treasurer may, in addition to suspending or disqualifying the qualified public depository, impose an administrative penalty in an amount not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate penalty for any single continuing violation under this subdivision shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) irrespective of the number of days the violation continues prior to the assessment of the penalty.\n\n(f) Any suspension shall be for the period established by the board in the order of suspension, not to exceed a period of six months. During the period of suspension of any qualified public depository, the contingent liability, required collateral, and reporting requirements of the suspended public depository remain in force under the same conditions as if the suspended depository had remained qualified. Upon expiration of the suspension period, the suspended qualified public depository may, by order of the State Treasurer, be reinstated as a qualified public depository if the State Treasurer finds that the financial institution has corrected the conditions that resulted in suspension and otherwise is in compliance with all provisions of this chapter and of the board’s standards, rules, regulations, and orders.\n\n(g) Except as may otherwise be provided by the board of directors by rule or regulation, any qualified public depository which has been disqualified may not reapply for qualification until after the expiration of one year from the date of the final order of disqualification or the final disposition of any appeal taken therefrom. During the period of disqualification, the contingent liability, required collateral, and reporting requirements of the disqualified public depository remain in force under the same conditions as if the disqualified depository had remained qualified. A qualified public depository that has been disqualified shall not receive or retain public deposits after the effective date of disqualification. The State Treasurer shall, upon request, return to the disqualified public depository that portion of the collateral pledged that is in excess of the required collateral applicable to the disqualified public depository.\n\n(Act 2000-748, p. 1669, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 41-14A-9\n\nProcedures for Payment of Losses.\n\n(a) When the State Treasurer becomes aware that a default or insolvency has occurred, the State Treasurer shall provide notice as required in subsection (b) and implement the following procedures:\n\n(1) The State Treasurer shall obtain information from the Superintendent of Banks of the State Banking Department or the receiver of the qualified public depository in default in order to ascertain the amount of funds of each public depositor on deposit at such depository and the amount of deposit insurance applicable to such deposits.\n\n(2) The potential loss to public depositors shall be calculated by compiling claims received from public depositors. The State Treasurer shall validate claims of public depositors who filed claims under subsection (b) and which have been confirmed under subdivision (1).\n\n(3) The loss to public depositors shall be satisfied, insofar as possible, first through any applicable deposit insurance and then through the sale of securities pledged by the defaulting depository. If the loss to public depositors is not covered by insurance or the proceeds of the sale, coverage of the remaining loss shall be provided by assessment against the other qualified public depositories following the expiration of the 120-day period for the filing of claims by public depositors. However, if the sale of securities cannot be accomplished within seven days following the expiration of the 120-day period for the filing of claims by public depositors, the State Treasurer may proceed with the assessment for qualified public depositories. The assessment for each qualified public depository shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of any remaining loss to all public depositors by a percentage which represents the average monthly balance of public deposits held by each qualified public depository during the previous 12 months or, in the event a qualified public depository shall have participated in the program for less than 12 months, the qualified public depository’s average monthly balance for the month or months during which the qualified public depository shall have held any public deposits, divided by the total average monthly balances of public deposits held by all qualified public depositories, excluding those of the defaulting or insolvent depository, during the same period.\n\n(4) Each qualified public depository shall pay its assessment to the State Treasurer for deposit to the Loss Payment Fund within seven business days after it receives notice of the assessment. If a depository fails to pay its assessment when due, the State Treasurer shall satisfy the assessment by selling securities pledged by that depository.\n\n(5) The State Treasurer shall distribute the funds to the public depositors of the qualified public depository in default according to their validated claims. At the discretion of the State Treasurer, the State Treasurer may make partial payments to public depositors that have experienced a loss of public funds which is critical to the immediate operations of the public entity.\n\n(6) Public depositors receiving payment under the provisions of this section shall assign to the Loss Payment Fund any interest they may have in funds that may subsequently be made available to the qualified public depository in default. If the qualified public depository in default or its receiver provides the funds to the State Treasurer for the account of the Loss Payment Fund, the State Treasurer shall distribute the funds, plus all accrued interest which has accumulated from the investment of the funds, if any, to the depositories which paid assessments on the same pro rata basis as the assessments were paid. If the board of directors deems it prudent to do so, the board of directors may authorize the State Treasurer to enforce any or all claims, or take any other action, against a defaulting or insolvent qualified public depository or third party to recover all or part of any losses to any public depositor or assessments against any other qualified public depositories. Action or inaction by the board of directors or the State Treasurer will not impair the rights that any public depositor or qualified public depository may have against a defaulting or insolvent qualified public depository or any third party.\n\n(7) Expenses incurred by the board of directors, the State Treasurer, or their agents in connection with a default or insolvency that is not normally incurred in the administration of the SAFE Program shall be paid out of the proceeds from the sale of the pledged collateral.\n\n(b) Upon determining the default or insolvency of a qualified public depository, the State Treasurer shall provide notice of such default or insolvency to all public depositors of such qualified public depository the identity of which is reflected in the board’s or the qualified public depository’s records, “known public depositors,” which notice, the “first notice,” shall be provided by certified or registered mail to the last address for each such public depositor reflected in the qualified public depository’s records and shall specify that public depositors having claims or demands against the funds occasioned by the default or insolvency must file their claims with the State Treasurer within 120 days after the date of the notice. In the case of any known public depositor which has not filed a claim with the State Treasurer within 45 days after the date of the first notice, the State Treasurer shall mail a second notice, the “second notice,” by certified or registered mail to the last address for such known public depositor reflected in the qualified public depository’s records, which second notice shall specify the date by which claims must be filed with the State Treasurer. The second notice shall be mailed by the State Treasurer not more than 55 days after the date of the first notice. Contemporaneously with the mailing of the first notice and the second notice, the State Treasurer shall provide to the judge of probate of each county of the state and publish in a newspaper of general circulation a notice, which notice shall identify the defaulted or insolvent qualified public depository, the date before which public depositors must file claims with the State Treasurer under this chapter, and requesting that the judge of probate provide copies of such notice to each covered public entity within the judge of probate’s county. The judge of probate of the various counties of this state shall promptly endeavor to provide copies of said notices to each covered public entity in the judge of probate’s county which is known to the judge of probate, but in no event shall the judge of probate be liable for the failure of any covered public entity to receive copies of said notices.\n\n(c) No claim against the Loss Payment Fund is binding on the State Treasurer or the Loss Payment Fund unless presented within 120 days after the date of the first notice.\n\n(d) Nothing contained in this chapter shall affect any proceeding to:\n\n(1) Enforce any real property mortgage, chattel mortgage, security interest, or other lien on property of a qualified public depository that is in default or insolvency.\n\n(2) Establish liability of a qualified public depository that is in default or insolvency to the limits of any federal or other casualty insurance protection.\n\n(Act 2000-748, p. 1669, §1.)",

The term “losses,” for purposes of this chapter, shall also include losses of interest or other accumulations to the public depositor as a result of penalties for early withdrawal required by applicable federal laws or regulations because of suspension or disqualification of a qualified public depository by the State Treasurer under the authority granted in this chapter or because of withdrawal from the SAFE Program in accordance with rules or regulations adopted by the board of directors pursuant to this chapter. In that event, the State Treasurer is authorized to assess against the suspended, disqualified, or withdrawing public depository, in addition to any amount authorized by any other provisions of this chapter, an administrative penalty equal to the amount of the early withdrawal penalty and to pay that amount over to the public depositor as reimbursement for such loss. Any money in the Loss Payment Fund estimated not to be needed for immediate cash requirements shall be invested in any securities or other investments selected by the State Treasurer that are permitted under Section 41-14-30.
