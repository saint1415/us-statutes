This inventory shall include the following specific information:\n\n(1) Number of vehicles classified by the model year, make, model, engine size, vehicle identification number (VIN), drivetrain type of 2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, and the rated vehicle weight and classification as either light-duty, medium-duty, or heavy-duty.\n\n(2) Miles per gallon or gallon equivalent, per vehicle.\n\n(3) Average fuel economy of all light-duty vehicles in the fleet.\n\n(4) Average fuel economy of all medium-duty vehicles in the fleet.\n\n(5) Average fuel economy of all heavy-duty vehicles in the fleet.\n\n(6) Type of fuel or power source including, but not limited to, electricity used.\n\n(7) Average cost per gallon, or gallon equivalent of fuel.\n\n(8) Average fuel cost per mile.\n\n(9) Annual miles driven per vehicle.\n\n(10) Total fuel or power consumption per vehicle.\n\n(11) Vehicle function, such as the tasks associated with the vehicle’s use.\n\n(b) Fleet managers from state departments and agencies shall be responsible for providing baseline data in a reliable and verifiable manner. The data shall be submitted to the Green Fleets Review Committee established in Section 41-17A-6 for use in measuring progress toward the goals outlined in Section 41-17A-4.\n\n(Act 2009-650, p. 1999, §3.)",

Whenever a fleet is taking into consideration a new fuel, the fuel provider shall submit U.S. Department of Energy statistics showing the life cycle emissions per gallon gasoline equivalent for the green fleet manager to submit to the committee.\n\n(Act 2009-650, p. 1999, §4.)",

The Permanent Joint Legislative Committee on Energy will appoint the members of the Green Fleets Review Committee. The membership of the committee shall reflect the racial, gender, geographic, urban/rural and economic diversity of the state. The Chair of the Green Fleets Review Committee may create advisory subcommittees and appoint members thereto, which may include members of the Green Fleets Review Committee, representatives from governmental agencies, and members of the public with interest and expertise in the objectives of the committee. The Green Fleets Review Committee shall create no more than two active advisory subcommittees at any given time unless the committee votes unanimously for additional subcommittees.\n\n(b) The committee shall thereafter meet at the call of the chair or any majority of the members thereof; provided, that the committee shall meet at least once each four months. The committee shall have a continuing existence and may meet, act, and conduct its business at any place within this state during the sessions of the Legislature or any recess thereof, and in the interim period between sessions.\n\n(c) Each legislative member of the committee or any subcommittee, if created, shall be entitled to his or her regular legislative compensation, his or her per diem, and travel expenses for each day he or she attends a meeting of the committee. Upon requisitions signed by the chair of the committee or subcommittees, these payments shall be paid out of any funds appropriated to the use of the Legislature by means of warrants drawn by the Comptroller on the State Treasury. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member shall receive additional legislative compensation or per diem when the Legislature is in session or if a member is being paid any other payments on the same dates for attendance on other state business. The total legislative expenditures of the committee shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) per fiscal year.\n\n(d) On an annual basis, all state department and agency fleet managers shall submit a draft of their green fleets plan to the Department of Transportation Office of Fleet Management, and the Green Fleets Review Committee detailing how vehicle procurement, fleet operations, and employee travel activity are intended to conform to the green fleet policies and strategies outlined in Section 41-17A-5. Each green fleets plan submitted shall also include, as an appendix or addendum, an updated fleet vehicle inventory list in the same format as the fleet vehicle inventory required by Section 41-17A-3.\n\n(e) Each green fleets plan shall be reviewed by the Department of Transportation Office of Fleet Management, and the committee for overall conformity with the policies and for completeness in addressing the green fleets strategies. Inadequate plans shall be returned to the submitting department or agency for revision and discussion with the committee.\n\n(f) Any appeal of the committee’s decisions must be made in writing to the committee accompanied by appropriate documentation. Valid reasons for an appeal include unavailability of appropriate fleet vehicles, incremental costs in excess of the full life-cycle savings that would accrue from the acquisition of a given vehicle, and the primacy of a given vehicle’s mission to public safety or a similar area judged to be applicable by the committee.\n\n(g) Approval of vehicle procurement requests for each department or agency is contingent upon a satisfactory recommendation from the State Fleet Manager as to the merit of the department’s or agency’s green fleets plan.\n\n(h) The most innovative green fleets plan implemented shall receive recognition in an annual award to the department or agency submitting the most innovative plan. The committee shall determine the recipient of the award during the annual green fleets review meeting.\n\n(Act 2009-650, p. 1999, §6; Act 2013-282, p. 933, §1.)",
