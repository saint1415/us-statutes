BCL Properties v. Boyle, 314 Neb. 607, 992 N.W.2d 440 (2023).This section authorizes attorney fees in circumstances involving the wrongful deprivation of benefits or bad faith, but it does not authorize such fees in every action involving foreclosure of a construction lien. Echo Group v. Tradesmen Internat., 312 Neb. 729, 980 N.W.2d 869 (2022).To act with bad faith, one must know his or her lien is invalid or overstated or act with reckless disregard as to such facts. Chicago Lumber Co. of Omaha v. Selvera, 282 Neb. 12, 809 N.W.2d 469 (2011).While this section states that damages awarded may include reasonable attorney fees, it does not mandate the award of such fees. Model Interiors v. 2566 Leavenworth, LLC, 19 Neb. App. 56, 809 N.W.2d 775 (2011).",
