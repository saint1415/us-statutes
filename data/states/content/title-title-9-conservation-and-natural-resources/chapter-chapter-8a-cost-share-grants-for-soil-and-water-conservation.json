It is further declared that at the present time, due to cutbacks in federal soil conservation and reforestation programs there exists an inadequate supply of funds in the state to enable the financing of much needed soil conservation, agricultural water quality and forestry improvement programs; that the inability to finance such programs impedes the economic and physical development of the state, adversely affects the welfare and prosperity of all of the people of the state and accordingly creates and fosters conditions adverse to the general health and welfare of the citizens of the state; and that the making available in the manner provided in this chapter of appropriated moneys to assist the financing of much needed soil conservation, agricultural water and forestry improvement programs will result in the alleviation or reduction of the adverse consequences which have resulted.\n\n(Acts 1985, 1st Ex.

Each voting member of the commission, except the two citizens appointed by the Governor, may appoint a designee to represent him or her at all commission meetings. The members of the commission may request that a member replace his or her designee if the designee has been absent from three or more consecutive meetings without good cause. The Chair of the Senate Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee, the Chair of the House Agriculture and Forestry Committee, two members of the House, and two members of the Senate appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Lieutenant Governor, respectively, shall also serve as nonvoting ex officio members of the commission and as an oversight committee to review and report to the Legislature respecting the programs and activities of the commission. The members of the commission appointed by the Governor shall be appointed at the beginning of each organizational session of the Legislature to serve until the next organizational session of the Legislature; provided, however, that the initial appointed members will be appointed promptly following ratification by the qualified electors of the state of the amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 that was proposed by House Bill 10 introduced at that special session of the Legislature that convened on January 23, 1985. Each member shall hold office for the term of his or her appointment, if he or she is appointed, or as long as he or she serves in one of the positions listed above, and until his or her successor shall have been appointed and qualified.\n\n(b) The Governor shall serve as chair of the commission and the commission shall elect from among its members a vice-chair, a secretary, and such other officers as it may determine.

The appointment shall be made not earlier than 30 days prior to the date on which the member of the commission is to take office. Each appointed member of the commission shall hold office from the effective date of his or her appointment until the expiration of the term, or portion thereof, for which he or she was appointed, and if the term of any member of the commission expires prior to the reappointment of the member of the commission or prior to the appointment of his or her successor, the member of the commission shall continue to serve until his or her successor is appointed, and if the member of the commission is reappointed for a new term after the expiration of the immediately preceding term which he or she has been serving, his or her new term of office shall be deemed to have commenced at noon on the date on which the immediately preceding term shall have expired.

The notice to each member of the commission may be waived by the member of the commission, either before or after the meeting with respect to which notice would otherwise be required. A majority of the voting members of the commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and decisions shall be made and resolutions adopted on the basis of a majority of the quorum then present and voting, with each voting member of the commission having a single vote. No vacancy in the membership of the commission or the voluntary disqualification or abstention of any member of the commission shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all of the powers and duties of the commission. No member or officer of the commission shall receive any salary therefor, but may be reimbursed for necessary travel and the reasonable expenses of performing the duties of office. All proceedings of the commission shall be reduced to writing by the secretary, signed by the chair and at least three members of the commission, recorded in a substantially bound book, and filed in the office of the commission. All proceedings of the commission shall be open to the public, except that executive or secret sessions may be held when the character or good name of a person is involved, and all records of the commission shall be subject to public inspection during business hours.

Agreement to maintain practices for which allocated funds are being paid shall be accomplished by completing and signing a maintenance agreement. Specific conditions of the maintenance agreement shall be detailed on a form specified by the commission, and may include provisions for repayment of cost-share grants. Completion of the form and signature of the eligible person is required prior to transfer of the payment from the district to the recipient.\n\nAgreements to perform soil and water conservation practices for which allocated funds are being paid shall be by completing and signing a performance agreement. Specific conditions of the performance agreement shall be detailed on a form specified by the commission. Completion of the form and signature of the eligible person is required prior to transfer of the payment from the district to the recipient(s).\n\nThe soil and water conservation district shall establish and maintain in the case file the maintenance agreement and any amendments to the maintenance agreement.

In the event that additional funds are not available, the project may be redesigned, if possible, to a level commensurate with available allocated funds, provided the redesign still meets standards established by the commission, or the applicant can agree to assume full financial responsibility for the portion of the project cost in excess of the amount obligated.\n\nThe successful applicant shall be responsible for securing any contractor(s) needed and for all contractual or other agreements necessary to construct or perform the approved practice(s). The designated technician will determine if the completed practice is in compliance with applicable standards and specifications. The designated technician shall attest to completion and compliance to the standards by completing and signing a certification of practice quantities and cost. The completed certification will be retained in the district case file for the appropriate landowner.\n\nA seller of agricultural or timber land with respect to which a maintenance agreement is in effect may request the soil and water conservation district to inspect the practices. If the practices have not been removed, altered, or modified, the district shall issue a written statement that the seller has satisfactorily maintained the permanent practice as of the date of the statement.\n\nThe buyer of lands covered by a maintenance agreement may also request that the district inspect the lands to determine whether any practice has been removed, altered, or modified as of the date of the inspection. If so, the district will provide the buyer with a statement specifying the extent of noncompliance as of the date of the statement. The seller and the buyer, if known, shall be given notice of the time of inspection so that they may be present during the inspection to express their views as to compliance.\n\n(Acts 1985, 1st Ex.
