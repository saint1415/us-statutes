It is the intent of the Legislature that the management of aquatic plants in the waters of the Tennessee River be carried out under the general supervision and stewardship of a board, as preventing the spread of and managing the infestation of invasive aquatic plants in public waters of the Tennessee River and its tributaries is best accomplished through coordinated educational and management activities.\n\n(Act 2013-384, p. 1442, §2.)",
