Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, a licensee’s failure to pay the fees set forth in Chapter 7 of this title or meet the education requirements established by the Commissioner shall result in the lapse by operation of law of the license issued to such licensee, without any notice required to be sent by the Department of Insurance to the licensee.(g) An individual licensee who fails to timely renew and, as a result, allows said individual licensee's license to lapse may, within 12 months from the due date of the renewal fee or due date for the completion of the education requirements, as applicable, reapply for the same license without the necessity of passing a written examination. However, a penalty in the amount of double the unpaid renewal fee shall be required for any renewal fee received after the due date and within the first grace period of 6 months from the due date of the renewal fee; and may be subject to a civil fine of not less than $200 and not more than $1,000 within the second grace period of 6 months after the due date of the first grace period.

The licensee may also request a waiver of any examination requirement or any other fine or sanction imposed for failure to comply with renewal procedures.(i) The license shall contain the licensee’s name, address, and personal identification number, and the date of issuance, the lines of authority, the expiration date and any other information the Insurance Commissioner deems necessary.(j) Licensees shall inform the Insurance Commissioner by any means acceptable to the Insurance Commissioner of a legal name change or a change of physical mailing address or electronic mail address within 30 days of the change.

In order to assist in the performance of the Insurance Commissioner’s duties, the Insurance Commissioner may contract with nongovernmental entities, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or any affiliates or subsidiaries that the NAIC oversees, to perform any ministerial functions, including the collection of fees, related to producer, adjuster and appraiser licensing that the Insurance Commissioner and the nongovernmental entity may deem appropriate.(l) The Commissioner may participate, in whole or in part, with the NAIC, or any affiliates or subsidiaries the NAIC oversees, in a centralized license registry where insurance producer licenses, adjuster licenses, appraiser licenses and appointments may be centrally or simultaneously effected for all states that require an insurance producer license, adjuster license or appraiser license and participate in such centralized license registry. If the Commissioner finds that participation in such a centralized license registry is in the public interest, the Commissioner may adopt by rule any uniform standards and procedures as necessary to participate in the registry. This includes the central collection of all fees for licenses or appointments that are processed through the registry.(m)Records. —(1) The licensee shall maintain at such licensee's principal place of business the license issued by the Commissioner, together with such records as may be reasonably required by the Commissioner.
