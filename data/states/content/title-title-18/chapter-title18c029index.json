Such a contract which includes extra benefits of kinds set forth in §§ 902 (“life insurance” defined) and 903 (“health insurance” defined) of this title shall nevertheless be deemed to be an annuity if such extra benefits constitute a subsidiary or incidental part of the entire contract.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2902;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;64 Del. Laws, c. 155,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2903. “Industrial life insurance” defined.For the purposes of this title “industrial life insurance” is that form of life insurance written under policies of face amount of $1,000 or less bearing the words “industrial policy” imprinted on the face thereof as part of the descriptive matter and under which premiums are payable monthly or more often.18 Del.

Standard provisions required.(a) No policy of life insurance, other than pure endowments with or without return of premiums or of premiums and interest, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless it contains in substance all of the applicable provisions required by §§ 2905-2916, inclusive, of this title. This section shall not apply to annuity contracts nor to any provision of a life insurance policy, or contract supplemental thereto, relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means.(b) Any of such provisions or portions thereof not applicable to single premium or nonparticipating or term policies or insurance granted in exchange for lapsed or surrendered policies shall to that extent not be incorporated therein.18 Del.

Grace period.There shall be a provision that a grace period of 30 days or, at the option of the insurer, of 1 month of not less than 30 days, or of 4 weeks in the case of industrial life insurance policies the premiums for which are payable more frequently than monthly shall be allowed within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in full force. The insurer may impose an interest charge not in excess of 6% per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment of the premium, and, whether or not such interest charge is imposed, if a claim arises under the policy during such period of grace, the amount of any premium due or overdue, together with interest and any deferred installment of the annual premium, may be deducted from the policy proceeds. Grace shall date from the premium due date specified in the policy.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2906;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2907. Entire contract.There shall be a provision that except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the policy and the application therefor, if a copy of such application is endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties and that all statements contained in the application shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2907;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2908.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2909;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2910. Dividends.(a) There shall be a provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy, provided the policy is in force and all premiums to that date are paid. Except as hereinafter provided, any dividends becoming payable shall at the option of the party entitled to elect such option be either:(1) Payable in cash; or(2) Applied to any one of such other dividend options as may be provided by the policy. If any such other dividend options are provided, the policy shall further state which option shall be automatically effective if such party shall not have elected some other option. If the policy specifies a period within which such other dividend option may be elected, such period shall be not less than 30 days following the date on which such dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend shall be deemed to be payable in cash within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section above even though the policy provides that payment of such dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, provided such period does not exceed 6 years from the date of apportionment and that interest will be added to such dividend at a specified rate.(b) Renewable term policies of 10 years or less may provide that the surplus accrued to such policies shall be determined and apportioned each year after the second policy year and accumulated during each renewal period and that at the end of the renewal period, on renewal of the policy by the insured, the insurer shall apply the accumulated surplus as an annuity for the next succeeding renewal term in the reduction of premiums.(c) In participating industrial life insurance policies, in lieu of the provision required in subsection (a) of this section above, there shall be a provision that, beginning not later than the end of the fifth policy year, the policy shall participate annually in the divisible surplus, if any, in the manner set forth in the policy.(d) This section does not apply to insurance issued under nonforfeiture provisions of lapsed or surrendered policies.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2910;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2911. Policy loan.(a) There shall be a provision that after 3 full years’ premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security thereof, at a rate of interest not exceeding 8% per annum (if payable in advance such interest shall not exceed the rate of 7.4% per annum for policies issued prior to January 1, 1983) an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled thereto, less than the loan value of the policy. Before approving any policy provision providing for a rate of interest in excess of 6%, the Commissioner may require assurances by the insurer that the holders of such policies will benefit from the increased earning of the insurer resulting from the use of such higher rates, through the use of higher dividends or lower premiums, or both. The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, and the insurer may deduct, either from such loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining such cash surrender value, including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value thereof, then the policy shall terminate and become void, but not until at least 30 days’ notice has been mailed by the insurer to the last address on record with the insurer of the insured or other policy owner and of any assignee of record at the insurer’s home office. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for 6 months after application therefor. Such provision shall also contain a table showing in figures the loan values each year during the first 20 years of the policy or during the term of the policy whichever is shorter. The policy, at the insurer’s option, may provide for an automatic premium loan.(b) (1) Policies issued on or after January 1, 1983, shall provide for policy loan interest rates as follows:a. A provision permitting a maximum interest rate of not more than 8% per annum; orb. A provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established from time to time by the life insurer as permitted by law.(2) The rate of interest charged on a policy loan made under paragraph (b)(1)b. of this section shall not exceed the higher of the following:a. The published monthly average for the calendar month ending 2 months before the date on which the rate is determined; orb. The rate used to compute the cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus 1% per annum.(3) The term “published monthly average” means:a. Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average — Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or any successor thereto; orb. In the event that the Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average — Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published, a substantially similar average, established by regulation issued by the Commissioner.(4) If the maximum rate of interest is determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)b. of this section, the policy shall contain a provision setting forth the frequency at which the rate is to be determined for that policy.(5) The maximum rate for each policy must be determined at regular intervals at least once every 12 months, but not more frequently than once in any 3-month period. At the intervals specified in the policy:a. The rate being charged may be increased whenever such increase as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section would increase that rate by1/2% or more per annum;b. The rate being charged must be reduced whenever such reduction as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section would decrease that rate by1/2% or more per annum.(6) The life insurer shall:a. Notify the policyholder at the time a cash loan is made of the initial rate of interest on the loan;b. Notify the policyholder with respect to premium loans of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so after making the initial loan. Notice need not be given to the policyholder when a further premium loan is added, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)c. of this section below;c. Send to policyholders with loans reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate; andd. Include in the notices required above the substance of the pertinent provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (4) of this section.(7) The loan value of the policy shall be determined in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, but no policy shall terminate in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year, and the life insurer shall maintain coverage during that policy year until the time at which it would otherwise have terminated if there had been no change during that policy year.(8) The substance of the pertinent provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (4) of this section shall be set forth in the policies to which they apply.(9) For purposes of this section:a. The rate of interest on policy loans permitted under this subsection includes the interest rate charged on reinstatement of policy loans for the period during and after any lapse of a policy.b. The term “policy loan” includes any premium loan made under a policy to pay 1 or more premiums that were not paid to the life insurer as they fell due.c. The term “policyholder” includes the owner of the policy or the person designated to pay premiums as shown on the records of the life insurer.d. The term “policy” includes certificates issued by a fraternal benefit society and annuity contracts which provide for policy loans.(10) No other provision of law shall apply to policy loan interest rates unless made specifically applicable to such rates.(11) This subsection shall not apply to any insurance contract issued before January 1, 1983, unless the policyholder agrees in writing to the applicability of such provisions.(c) This section shall not apply to term policies or to term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions or to industrial life insurance policies.18 Del.

Reinstatement.There shall be a provision that unless:(1) The policy has been surrendered for its cash surrender value;(2) Its cash surrender value has been exhausted; or(3) The paid-up term insurance, if any, has expired;the policy will be reinstated at any time within 3 years (or 2 years in the case of industrial life insurance policies) from the date of premium default upon written application therefor, the production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer, the payment of all premiums in arrears with interest at a rate not exceeding 6% per annum compounded annually, and the payment or reinstatement of any indebtedness to the insurer upon the policy with interest as provided in § 2911 of this title.18 Del.

Payment of claims.(a) There shall be a provision that when the benefits under the policy become payable by reason of the death of the insured, settlement must be made upon receipt of due proof of death, which may consist of a certified copy of the insured’s death certificate or other lawful evidence providing equivalent information, and, at the insurer’s option, surrender of the policy or proof of the interest of the claimant. If an insurer specifies a particular period before the expiration of which settlement must be made, the period may not exceed 30 days from the receipt of such proofs.(b) There shall be a provision for the payment of interest on the death benefit under the policy as follows:(1) Interest accrues and is payable from the date of the initial filing of the death benefits claim, which includes due proof of death.(2) Interest accrues at the rate applicable to the policy for funds left on deposit or, if the insurer has not established a rate for funds left on deposit, at the 2 year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate as published by the Federal Reserve. In determining the effective annual rate, the insurer shall use the rate in effect on the date of the filing of the initial death benefits claim.(c) Interest accrues at the effective annual rate determined in subsection (b) of this section, plus additional interest at a rate of 10% annually beginning with the date that is 31 calendar days from the latest of paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to the date the claim is paid, where it is all of the following:(1) The date that due proof of death is received by the insurer.(2) The date the insurer receives sufficient information to determine its liability, the extent of the liability, and the appropriate payee legally entitled to the proceeds.(3) The date that legal impediments to payments of proceeds that depend on the action of parties other than the insurer are resolved and sufficient evidence of the same is provided to the insurer.

Beneficiary, industrial policies.An industrial life insurance policy shall have the name of the beneficiary designated thereon or in the application or other form if attached to the policy, with a reservation of the right to designate or change the beneficiary after the issuance of the policy, unless such beneficiary be irrevocably designated. The policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until endorsed on the policy by the insurer and that the insurer may refuse to endorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which shall not be less than 30 days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make any payment thereunder to the executor or administrator of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention or burial of the insured.

In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.(2) That, upon surrender of the policy within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least 3 full years in the case of ordinary insurance or 5 full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.(3) That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default.(4) That if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.(5) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.(6) A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of 6 months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.(b) Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:(1) The then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary; and(2) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (g) of this section as defined therein, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in the first paragraph of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (g) of this section as defined therein, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse’s age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in the first paragraph of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this section, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.(c) Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.(d) This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (g) of this section as defined therein. Except as provided in the third paragraph of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (1) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (2) 2% of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy; (3) 40% of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; (4) 25% of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less. In applying the percentages specified in (3) and (4) above, no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4% of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of this subsection shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, provided, however, that in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age 10 were the amount provided by such policy at age 10.The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (1) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (2) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (1) and (2) being calculated separately and as specified in the first 2 paragraphs of this subsection except that, for the purposes of (2), (3) and (4) of the first such paragraph, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (2) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (1).Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 3 years younger than the actual age of the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 31/2% per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may not be more than 130% of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.(e) This subsection shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (g) of this section as defined therein. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed 31/2% per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4% per annum may be used for policies issued on or after June 21, 1973, and prior to July 8, 1980, and a rate of interest not exceeding 51/2% per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 8, 1980, and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than 6 years younger than the actual age of the insured. Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.After May 21, 1959, any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such insurer), this subsection shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1966.(f) This subsection shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (g) of this section as defined therein. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection, as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed 31/2% per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4% per annum may be used for policies issued on or after June 21, 1973, and prior to July 8, 1980, and a rate of interest not exceeding 51/2% per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 8, 1980, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding 61/2% per annum may be used. Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.After July 7, 1964, any insurer may file with the Commissioner, a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, then upon such date (which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such insurer), this subsection shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1968.(g) (1) This subsection shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined herein. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:a. The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;b. 1% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; andc. 125% of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined.Provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in paragraph (g)(1)c. of this section above no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed 4% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(2) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of 1 per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.(3) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (A) the sum of (i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over (B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.(5) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:a. 1% of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; andb. 125% of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.(6) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where (A) equals the sum of (i) the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of 1 per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, and (ii) the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, and (B) equals the present value of an annuity of 1 per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality costs as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.(8) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies or ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (i) the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality table or (ii) at the election of the insurer for any 1 or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with 10-Year Select Mortality Factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in that calendar year. Provided, however, that:a. At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.b. Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.c. An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.d. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance.e. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables.f. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without 10-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without 10-year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.g. For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.(9) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125% of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the standard valuation law, rounded to the nearer1/4of 1%; provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than 4%. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.(10) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.(11) After June 21, 1983, any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.(h) In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) herein, then:(1) The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) herein;(2) The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;(3) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance, as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(i) Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, additional benefits payable:(1) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;(2) In the event of total and permanent disability;(3) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;(4) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;(5) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child’s age is 26, is uniform in amount after the child’s age is 1, and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child;(6) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits,shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.(j) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this law, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1987. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than2/10of 1% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of:(1) The greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified; and(2) The present value of any existing paid up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary. Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (b) or (d) of this section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (b) or (d) of this section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (d) or (g) of this section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:(1) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least2/10of 1% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and(2) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the 2 policy anniversaries specified in the preceding item may apply to fewer than 5 consecutive policy years.Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (d) or (g) of this section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy’s compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (a), (b), (c), (g) and (i) of this section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as paragraphs (i)(1)-(6) of this section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.(k) This section shall not apply to any of the following:(1) Reinsurance;(2) Group insurance;(3) Pure endowment;(4) Annuity or reversionary annuity contract;(5) Term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;(6) Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section, is less than the adjusted premium so calculated, on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;(7) Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section, exceeds 21/2% of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year; nor(8) Policy which shall be delivered outside this State through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy.For purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.(l) After March 30, 1943, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1948. After the filing of such notice, upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this section for such insurer), this section shall become operative with respect to the policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election the operative date of this section for such insurer shall be January 1, 1948.(m) For purposes of this section, the term “operative date of the valuation manual” means January 1 of the first calendar year that the valuation manual as defined in § 1111(b)(11) of this title is effective.18 Del.

Laws, c. 105, § 2].(a) This section shall be known as the standard nonforfeiture law for individual deferred annuities.(b) This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under § 408 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. § 408], as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract which shall be delivered outside this State through an agent or other representative of the company issuing the contract.(c) In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this chapter as defined in subsection (d) of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection (b) of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are at least as favorable to the contractholder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:(1) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, upon the written request of the contract owner the company shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections (e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) of this section;(2) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company shall pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit not to exceed such amount as is specified in subsections (e), (f), (h) and (j) of this section. The company may reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of 6 months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract, after making written request and receiving written approval of the commissioner. The request must address the necessity and equitability of the deferral to all policyholders;(3) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits;(4) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the State in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of 2 full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract.(d) The minimum values as specified in subsections (e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this subsection:(1) With respect to contracts providing for flexible considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at a rate of interest of 3% per annum of percentages of the net considerations (as hereinafter defined) paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of:a. Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of 3% per annum; andb. The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued; and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount not less than $0.00 and shall be equal to the corresponding gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of $30 and less a collection charge of $1.25 per consideration credited to the contract during that contract year. The percentages of net considerations shall be 65% of the net consideration for the first contract year and 871/2% of the net considerations for the second and later contract years. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the percentage shall be 65% of the portion of the total net consideration for any renewal contract year which exceeds by not more than 2 times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was 65%. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the minimum interest rate at which net considerations, prior withdrawals and partial surrenders shall be accumulated, for the purpose of determining nonforfeiture amounts, shall be 1.5% per annum.(2) With respect to contracts providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations which are paid annually with 2 exceptions:a. The portion of the net consideration for the first contract year to be accumulated shall be the sum of 65% of the net consideration for the first contract year plus 221/2% of the excess of the net consideration for the first contract year over the lesser of the net considerations for the second and third contract years.b. The annual contract charge shall be the lesser of:1. Thirty dollars; or2. Ten percent of the gross annual consideration.(3) With respect to contracts providing for a single consideration, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations except that the percentage of net consideration used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to 90 percent and the net consideration shall be the gross consideration less a contract charge of $75.(4) Prior to July 1, 2006, a company may elect to comply with the provisions of either paragraph (d)(1)-(3) or (d)(5) of this section. On and after July 1, 2006, all companies shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section.(5) The minimum values as specified in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this paragraph.a. 1 The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments is equal to an accumulation up to such time, at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph (d)(5)b. of this section of the net considerations, as defined in paragraph (d)(5)a.2. of this section, paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of paragraphs (d)(5)a.1.A. through (d)(5)a.1.D. of this section as follows:A. Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph (d)(5)b. of this section;B. An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph (d)(5)b. of this section;C. Any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in paragraph (d)(5)b. of this section; andD. The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.2. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to 87.5% of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.b. 1. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of 3% per annum and paragraphs (d)(5)b.1.A. through C. of this section as follows, which must be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:A. The 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or as an average over a period, rounded to the nearest1/20th of 1%, specified in the contract no longer than 15 months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under paragraph (d)(5)b.2. of this section;B. Reduced by 125 basis points;C. Where the resulting interest rate is not less than 0.15%.2. The above interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the rate on a date or the rate averaged over a specified period that produces the value of the 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date.c. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in paragraph (d)(5)b.1.B. of this section by up to an additional 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity indexed benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction may not exceed the market value of the benefit. The Commissioner may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may disallow or limit the additional reduction.d. The Commissioner may adopt rules to implement paragraph (d)(5)c. of this section and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit and for other contracts that the Commissioner determines adjustments are justified.(e) Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. Such present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.(f) For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, such cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than 1% higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.(g) For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.(h) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections (f) and (g) of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant’s seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.(i) Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.(j) Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.(k) For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provisions, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding subsections (e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) of this section, additional benefits payable (i) in the event of total and permanent disability, (ii) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (iii) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.(l)After the effective date of this section, any company may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this section after a specified date before July 8, 1982. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this section for such company, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be the second anniversary of the effective date of this section.62 Del. Laws, c. 348,\n\n§\n\n 17;73 Del. Laws, c. 410,\n\n§\n\n 1;74 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§§\n\n 1-6;83 Del. Laws, c. 105,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n2930. Incontestability; limitation of liability after reinstatement.(a) A reinstated policy of life insurance or annuity contract may be contested on account of fraud or misrepresentation of facts material to the reinstatement only for the same period following reinstatement and with the same conditions and exceptions as the policy provides with respect to contestability after original issuance.(b) When any life insurance policy or annuity contract is reinstated, such reinstated policy or contract may exclude or restrict liability to the same extent that such liability could have been or was excluded or restricted when the policy or contract was originally issued and such exclusion or restriction shall be effective from the date of reinstatement.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2931;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2931. Participating, nonparticipating policies; right to issue.A life insurer may issue policies on either the participating basis or the nonparticipating basis, or on both bases, if the right or absence of right of participation is reasonably related to the premium charged and the insurer is otherwise not in violation of Chapter 23 of this title.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2932;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2932. Variable annuity contracts and life insurance policies; grace, reinstatement, nonforfeiture and reserve liability provisions.(a) A domestic life insurer, including for the purposes of this section all domestic fraternal beneficiary associations, societies or companies which operate on a legal reserve basis, may establish 1 or more separate accounts, and may allocate thereto amounts (including without limitation proceeds applied under optional modes of settlement or under dividend options) to provide for life insurance or annuities (and benefits incidental thereto), payable in fixed or variable amounts or both, subject to the following:(1) The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to a separate account shall be credited to or charged against the account, without regard to other income, gains or losses of the insurer.(2) Except as may be provided with respect to reserves for guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,a. Amounts allocated to any separate account and accumulations thereon may be invested and reinvested without regard to any requirements or limitations prescribed by this title governing the investments of life insurers; andb. The investments in such separate account or accounts shall not be taken into account in applying the investment limitations otherwise applicable to the investments of the insurer.(3) Except with the approval of the Commissioner and under such conditions as to investments and other matters as he or she may prescribe, which shall recognize the guaranteed nature of the benefits provided, reserves for:a. Benefits guaranteed as to dollar amount and duration; andb. Funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest shall not be maintained in a separate account.(4) Unless otherwise approved by the Commissioner, assets allocated to a separate account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then as provided under the terms of the contract or the rules or other written agreement applicable to such separate account, provided, that unless otherwise approved by the Commissioner, the portion, if any, of the assets of such separate account equal to the insurer’s reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the insurer’s assets.(5) Amounts allocated to a separate account in the exercise of the power granted by this section shall be owned by the insurer and the insurer shall not be, nor hold itself out to be, a trustee with respect to such amounts. If and to the extent so provided under the applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of any such separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to such account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer may conduct.(6) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets may be made by an insurer between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and 1 or more of its separate accounts unless, in case of a transfer into a separate account, such transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the contracts with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made, and unless such transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made:a. By a transfer of cash; orb. By a transfer of securities having a readily determinable market value, provided that such transfer of securities is approved by the Commissioner.The Commissioner may approve other transfers among such accounts if, in his or her opinion, such transfers would not be inequitable.(7) To the extent such insurer deems it necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, such insurer, with respect to any separate account, including without limitation any separate account which is a management investment company or a unit investment trust, may provide for persons having an interest therein appropriate voting and other rights and special procedures for the conduct of the business of such account, including without limitation special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of independent public accountants and the selection of a committee, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with such insurer, to manage the business of such account.(b) Any contract providing benefits payable in variable amounts delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedures to be followed by the insurer in determining the dollar amount of such variable benefits. Any such contract under which the benefits vary to reflect investment experience, including a group contract and any certificate in evidence of variable benefits issued thereunder shall state that such dollar amount will so vary and shall contain on its first page a statement to the effect that the benefits thereunder are on a variable basis.(c) No insurer shall deliver or issue for delivery within this State variable contracts unless it is licensed or organized to do a life insurance or annuity business in this State and the Commissioner is satisfied that its condition or method of operation in connection with the issuance of such contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or its policyholders in this State. In this connection, the Commissioner shall consider among other things:(1) The history and financial condition of the insurer;(2) The character, responsibility and fitness of the officers and directors of the insurer; and(3) The law and regulation under which the insurer is authorized in the state of domicile to issue variable contracts. If the insurer is a subsidiary of an admitted life insurer or affiliated with such insurer through common management or ownership, it may be deemed by the Commissioner to have met the provisions of this subsection if either it or the parent or the affiliated insurer meets the requirements hereof.(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commissioner shall have sole authority to regulate the issuance and sale of variable contracts, and to issue such reasonable rules and regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section.(e) Except for §§ 2919, 2924, 2925 and 2929A of this title, in the case of a variable annuity contract, and §§ 2906, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2929 and 3113 of this title, in the case of a variable life insurance policy, and except as otherwise provided in this section, all pertinent provisions of this title shall apply to separate accounts and contracts relating thereto. Any individual variable life insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall contain grace, reinstatement and nonforfeiture provisions appropriate to such a contract. Any individual variable annuity contract delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall contain grace and reinstatement provisions appropriate to such a contract. Any group variable life insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this State shall contain a grace provision appropriate to such a contract. The reserve liability for variable contracts shall be established in accordance with actuarial procedures that recognize the variable nature of the benefits provided and any mortality guarantees.18 Del.

Prohibited policy plans.(a) No life insurer shall hereafter deliver or issue for delivery in this State:(1) As part of or in combination with any life insurance, endowment or annuity contract, any agreement or plan, additional to the rights, dividends and benefits arising out of any such contract which provides for the accumulation of profits over a period of years and for payment of all or any part of such accumulated profits only to members or policyholders of a designated group or class who continue as members or policyholders until the end of a specified or ascertainable period of years;(2) Any “registered” policy, that is, any policy (other than one “registered” as a security under applicable state or federal law) purporting to be “registered” or otherwise specially recorded, with any agency of the State, or of any other state, or with any bank, trust company, escrow company or other institution other than the insurer, or purporting that any reserves, assets or deposits are held, or will be so held, for the special benefit or protection of the holder of such policy, by or through any such agency or institution;(3) Any policy or contract under which any part of the premium or of funds or values arising from the policy or contract or from investment of reserves, or from mortality savings, lapses or surrenders, in excess of the normal reserves or amounts required to pay death, endowment and nonforfeiture benefits in respective amounts as specified in or pursuant to the policy or contract, are on a basis not involving insurance or life contingency features, (i) to be placed in special funds or segregated accounts or specially designated places or, (ii) to be invested in specially designated investments or types thereof, and the funds or earnings thereon be divided among the holders of such policies or contracts, or their beneficiaries or assignees. This provision does not apply as to any contract authorized under § 2932 of this title;(4) Any policy providing for the segregation of policyholders into mathematical groups and providing benefits for a surviving policyholder arising out of the death of another policyholder of such group, or under any other similar plan;(5) Any policy providing benefits or values for surviving or continuing policyholders contingent upon the lapse or termination of the policies of other policyholders, whether by death or otherwise;(6) Any policy containing or referring to 1 or more of the following provisions or statements:a. Investment returns or profit-sharing, other than as a participation in the divisible surplus of the insurer under a regular participation provision as provided for in § 2910 of this title;b. Special treatment in the determination of any dividend that may be paid as to such policy;c. Reference to premiums as “deposits;”d. Relating policyholder interest or returns to those of stockholders;e. That the policyholder as a member of a select group will be entitled to extra benefits or extra dividends not available to policyholders generally.(b) This section shall not be deemed to prohibit the provision, payment, allowance or apportionment of regular annual dividends or “savings” under regular participating forms of policies or contracts.18 Del.

Registered policies, bonds — Records of Commissioner; valuation.(a) The Commissioner shall prepare and keep such records of all “registered” policies and bonds as will enable him or her to ascertain the reserve required thereon at any time according to the method and basis of valuation prescribed in §§ 1111-1113 of this title. Upon sufficient proof, attested by the president or vice-president and secretary of an insurer which has issued such “registered” policies or bonds, that any of them have been commuted or terminated, the Commissioner shall commute or cancel them upon his or her records.(b) On December 31 in every year, or within 60 days thereafter, the Commissioner shall cause the registered policies and bonds in force in each insurer to be carefully valued and the net reserve thereon ascertained according to the method and basis of valuation prescribed in §§ 1111-1113 of this title, and he or she shall thereupon furnish a certificate of the aggregate amount of such reserve to the respective insurers. The Commissioner may employ a competent actuary to make such computation, who shall be paid by the insurer for which the services are rendered, or the Commissioner may accept the computations of any of the insurers upon such proof as he or she may determine.18 Del.

Registered policies, bonds — Additional deposits.Each insurer which shall have registered policies or bonds outstanding shall make additional deposits from time to time, as the Commissioner may prescribe, in amounts of not less than $5,000, and of such securities as domestic life insurers are authorized by law to invest in, so that the market or amortized value of the securities on deposit shall always at least equal the net reserve required by the method and basis of valuation prescribed in §§ 1111-1113 of this title, on all the registered policies and bonds in force in the insurer.18 Del.

If at any time it appears from such certificates or otherwise that the value of securities held on deposit is less than the reserve required by the method and basis of valuation prescribed in §§ 1111-1113 of this title on all the registered policies and bonds in force in such insurer, the insurer shall have made good the deficit. If the insurer fails to make good such deficit for 60 days it shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against in the manner provided by Chapter 59 (Rehabilitation and Liquidation) of this title.18 Del.
