C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5717;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5718. Subscribers’ liability generally.(a) The liability of each subscriber, other than as to a nonassessable policy, for the obligations of the reciprocal insurer shall be an individual, several and proportionate liability, and not joint.(b) Except as to a nonassessable policy, each subscriber shall have a contingent assessment liability, in the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers’ agreement, for payment of actual losses and expenses incurred while the subscriber’s policy was in force.

Assessments.(a) Assessments may from time to time be levied upon subscribers of a domestic reciprocal insurer liable therefor under the terms of their policies by the attorney upon approval in advance by the subscribers’ advisory committee and the Commissioner or by the Commissioner in liquidation of the insurer.(b) Each subscriber’s share of a deficiency for which an assessment is made which shall not exceed in any event the subscriber’s aggregate contingent liability as computed in accordance with § 5722 of this title, shall be computed by applying to the premium earned on the subscriber’s policy or policies during the period to be covered by the assessment, the ratio of the total deficiency to the total premiums earned during such period upon all policies subject to the assessment.(c) In computing the earned premiums for the purposes of this section, the gross premium received by the insurer for the policy shall be used as a base, deducting therefrom solely charges not recurring upon the renewal or extension of the policy.(d) No subscriber shall have an offset against any assessment for which such subscriber is liable on account of any claim for unearned premium or losses payable.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5720;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5721.

C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5721;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5722. Aggregate or contingent liability.No 1 policy or subscriber as to such policy shall be assessed or charged with an aggregate or contingent liability as to obligations incurred by a domestic reciprocal insurer in any 1 calendar year in excess of the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers’ agreement, computed solely upon premium earned on such policy during that year.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5722;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5723. Nonassessable policies.(a) If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital stock and surplus required to be maintained by a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney and as approved by the subscribers’ advisory committee, the Commissioner shall issue his or her certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this State and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this State for so long as all such surplus remains unimpaired.(b) Upon impairment of such surplus, the Commissioner shall forthwith revoke the certificate. Such revocation shall not render subject to contingent liability any policy then in force and for the remainder of the period for which the premium has theretofore been paid, but, after such revocation, no policy shall be issued or renewed without providing for contingent assessment liability of the subscriber.(c) The Commissioner shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer so to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued unless it qualified to and does extinguish such liability of all its subscribers and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it. Except, that if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of such of its subscribers as may acquire such policies in such state and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in such state.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5723;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5724. Subscribers’ share in assets.Upon the liquidation of a domestic reciprocal insurer, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness and policy obligations, the return of any contributions of the attorney or other persons to its surplus and the return of any unused premium, savings or credits then standing on subscribers’ accounts shall be distributed to its subscribers who were such within the 12 months prior to the last termination of its certificate of authority, according to such reasonable formula as the Commissioner may approve.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5724;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5725. Merger or conversion.(a) A domestic reciprocal insurer upon affirmative vote of not less than2/3of its subscribers who vote on such merger, pursuant to due notice and the approval of the Commissioner of the terms therefor, may merge with another reciprocal insurer or be converted to a stock or mutual insurer.(b) Such a stock or mutual insurer shall be subject to the same capital or surplus requirements and shall have the same rights as a like domestic insurer transacting like kinds of insurance.(c) The Commissioner shall not approve any plan for such merger or conversion which is inequitable to subscribers, or which, if for conversion to a stock insurer, does not give each subscriber preferential right to acquire stock of the proposed insurer proportionate to each subscriber’s interest in the reciprocal insurer as determined in accordance with § 5724 of this title and a reasonable length of time within which to exercise such right.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5725;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5726. Impaired reciprocals.(a) If the assets of a domestic reciprocal insurer are at any time insufficient to discharge its liabilities, other than any liability on account of funds contributed by the attorney or others, and to maintain the required surplus, its attorney shall forthwith make up the deficiency or levy an assessment upon the subscribers for the amount needed to make up the deficiency but subject to the limitation set forth in the power of attorney or policy.(b) If the attorney fails to make up such deficiency or to make the assessment within 30 days after the Commissioner orders such attorney to do so or if the deficiency is not fully made up within 60 days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this title.(c) If liquidation of such an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscribers for such an amount, subject to limits as provided by this chapter, as the Commissioner determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney or other persons but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 5726;56 Del. Laws, c. 380,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
