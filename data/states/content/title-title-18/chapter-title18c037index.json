Thereafter, the debtor may cancel the policy at any time during the term of the loan and receive a refund of any of the unearned premium. However, only in those instances where insurance is a requirement for the extension of credit, the debtor may be required to offer evidence of alternative insurance acceptable to the creditor at the time of cancellation; and(5) A brief description of the coverage.(b) The disclosure required in subsection (a) of this section shall be provided in the following manner:(1) In connection with consumer credit insurance offered contemporaneously with the extension of credit or offered through direct mail advertisements, disclosure shall be made in writing and presented to the consumer in a clear or conspicuous manner;(2) In conjunction with the offer of credit insurance subsequent to the extension of credit by other than direct mail advertisements, disclosure may be provided orally so long as written disclosures are provided to the debtor no later than the earlier of:a.

The copy of the application for or notice of proposed insurance shall also refer exclusively to insurance coverage and shall be separate and apart from the loan, sale or other credit statement of account, instrument or agreement, unless the information required by this subsection is prominently set forth therein. Upon acceptance of the insurance by the insurer and within 30 days of the date upon which the debt is incurred or the election to purchase coverage is made, the insurer shall cause the individual policy or group certificate of insurance to be delivered to the debtor. The application or notice of proposed insurance shall state that upon acceptance by the insurer, the insurance shall become effective as provided in § 3705 of this title.(f) The application, notice of proposed insurance or certificate may be used to fulfill all of the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section if it contains all of the information required by those subsections.(g) The debtor has 30 days from the date that he or she receives either the individual policy or the group certificate to review the coverage purchased. At any time within the 30-day period, the debtor may contact the creditor or insurer issuing the policy or certificate and request that the coverage be canceled. The individual policy or group certificate may require the request to be in writing or that the policy or certificate be returned to the insurer or both. The debtor shall, within 30 days of the request, receive a full refund or credit of all premiums or insurance charges paid by the debtor, provided no loss has occurred and no claim has been made.(h) If the named insurer does not accept the risk, the debtor shall receive a policy or certificate of insurance setting forth the name and home office address of the substituted insurer and the amount of the premium to be charged, and, if the amount of premium is less than that set forth in the notice or proposed insurance, an appropriate refund shall be made within 30 days. If no insurer accepts the risk, then all premiums paid shall be refunded or credited within 30 days of application to the person entitled thereto.(i) For the purpose of subsection (e) of this section, an individual policy or group certificate delivered in conjunction with an open-end consumer credit agreement or any consumer credit insurance requested by the debtor after that date of the debt shall be deemed to be delivered at the time the debt is incurred or election to purchase coverage is made if the delivery occurs within 30 days of the date the insurance is effective.(j) An individual policy or group certificate delivered in conjunction with an open-end credit agreement shall continue from its effective date through the term of the agreement unless the individual policy or group certificate is terminated in accordance with its terms at an earlier date.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3707.

If the Commissioner does not disapprove a filing within 30 days, it may be deemed approved.(c) If the Commissioner disapproves the form in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall promptly notify the insurer in writing of the disapproval, and it is unlawful for the insurer to issue or use the form. In the notice, the Commissioner shall specify the reasons for disapproval and state that a hearing will be granted upon written request by the insurer.(d) The Commissioner may withdraw approval of any approved form when the Commissioner would be required to disapprove the form if it were filed at the time of the action of withdrawal. The withdrawal shall be in writing and shall specify the reasons for the withdrawal and the effective date of the withdrawal. Any insurer adversely affected by such withdrawal may, within 30 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal, request a hearing to determine whether the withdrawal should be annulled, modified or confirmed. Unless the Commissioner, in writing, in the withdrawal or subsequent thereto grants an extension, the withdrawal shall, in the absence of a request for a hearing, become effective, prospectively and not retroactively, on the ninety-first day following the delivery of the notice of withdrawal, and, if request for hearing is filed, on the 91st day following delivery of written notice of the Commissioner’s determination.(e) Any hearing requested pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall be noticed and conducted in accordance with the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29.(f) If a group policy of consumer credit insurance:(1) Has been delivered in this State before November 20, 1996; or(2) Has been or is delivered in another state before or after November 20, 1996,then the insurer shall be required to file only the group certificate and notice of proposed insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this State as specified in § 3706(c) and (e) of this title and such forms shall be approved by the Commissioner if they conform with the requirements specified in these subsections and if the schedules of premium rates applicable to the insurance evidenced by such certificate or notice are not in excess of the insurer’s schedules of premium rates filed with the Commissioner; provided however, that the premium rate in effect on existing group policies may be continued until the first policy anniversary date following November 22, 1996, as provided in § 3713 of this title. However, all other forms specified in subsection (a) of this section shall also be filed as specified in this section unless the group policy has been or is delivered in another state which has adopted statutes, regulations or other provisions similar to this section. In that event, the forms should be filed for informational purposes. However, the insurer shall be prohibited from using any form filed for informational purposes if the Commissioner subsequently determines that the form is not in substantive compliance with the requirements of this section.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3708. Premiums and refunds.(a) Any insurer may revise its schedules of premium rates from time to time and shall file the revised schedules with the Commissioner. No insurer shall issue any consumer credit insurance policy for which the premium rate exceeds that determined by the schedules of the insurer as then on file with the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall have the authority to promulgate regulations to assure that the premium rates are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided. In determining whether the premium rates are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided, the Commissioner shall consider and provide for: actual and expected loss experience, general and administrative expenses, loss settlement and adjustment expenses, reasonable creditor compensation, investment income, the manner in which premiums are charged and other acquisition costs, reserves, taxes, regulatory license fees and fund assessments, reasonable insurer profit and other relevant data, consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards.(b) Each individual policy or group certificate shall provide for a refund in the event of termination of the insurance prior to the scheduled maturity date of the insurance and upon notice to the insurer. The refund of an amount paid by the debtor for insurance shall be paid or credited promptly to the person entitled thereto; provided however, that the Commissioner shall prescribe a minimum refund and no refund which would be less than such minimum need be made. The formula to be used in computing such refund shall be filed with and approved by the Commissioner.(c) If a creditor requires a debtor to make any payment for consumer credit insurance and an individual policy or group certificate of insurance is not issued, the creditor shall immediately give written notice to the debtor and shall promptly make an appropriate credit to the account or issue a refund.(d) The amount charged to a debtor for any consumer credit insurance shall not exceed the premiums charged by the insurer, as computed at the time the charge to the debtor is determined.(e) The insurance premium or other identifiable charge for credit life or credit accident and health insurance may be collected from the insured or included in the principal of any loan or other transaction at the time such transaction is completed.(f) The premium or cost of credit life or credit accident and health insurance when issued through any creditor shall not be deemed interest or charges, consideration or an amount in excess of permitted charges in connection with the loan or other credit transaction, and any gain or advantage to the creditor arising out of the premium or commission or dividend from the issuance of such insurance shall not be deemed a violation of any other law, general or special, civil or criminal, of the State.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3709. Issuance of policies.All policies of consumer credit insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this State only by an insurer authorized to engage in the business of insurance therein and shall be issued only through holders of licenses or authorizations issued by the Commissioner.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3710. Claims.(a) All claims shall be promptly reported to the insurer or its designated claim representative and the insurer shall maintain adequate claim files. All claims shall be settled as soon as possible and in accordance with the terms of the insurance contract.(b) All claims shall be paid either by draft drawn upon the insurer, by electronic funds transfer or by check of the insurer to the order of the claimant to whom payment of the claim is due pursuant to the policy provisions or upon direction of such claimant to one specified.(c) No plan or arrangement shall be used whereby any person, firm or corporation other than the insurer or its designated claim representative shall be authorized to settle or adjust claims. The creditor shall not be designated as claim representative for the insurer in adjusting claims; provided, that a group policyholder may, by arrangement with the group insurer, draw drafts, checks or electronic transfers in payment of claims due to the group policyholder subject to audit and review by the insurer.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3711. Existing insurance — Choice of insurer.When consumer credit insurance is required as additional security for any debt, the debtor shall, upon request to the creditor, have the option of furnishing the required amount of insurance through existing policies of insurance owned or controlled by the debtor or of procuring and furnishing the required coverage through any insurer authorized to transact any insurance business within this State.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3712. Duties of an insurer.Except as otherwise prohibited by law, duties imposed upon an insurer within this chapter may be carried out by a creditor if the creditor is acting as a common law or statutory agent on behalf of the insurer.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n3713. Enforcement; penalties.(a) The Commissioner may, after notice and hearing, issue such rules and regulations as the Commissioner deems appropriate for the supervision of this chapter.(b) Whenever the Commissioner finds that there has been a violation of this chapter or any rules or regulations issued pursuant thereto, and after written notice thereof and hearing given to the insurer or other person authorized or licensed by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may impose an administrative penalty in accordance with § 329 of this title. The Commissioner, in his or her discretion, may revoke or suspend the license or certificate of authority of the person, firm or corporation guilty of repeated wilful violations.(c) Before the Commissioner may impose or order a penalty pursuant to this section, the violator shall be given notice of the violation and an opportunity to be heard at a public hearing. The procedures for such notice and hearing, and any appeal from the Commissioner’s decision shall be the same as set forth in the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29.(d) The Commissioner may set forth by regulation prima facie reasonable premium rates, together with corresponding safe-harbor benefit provisions, which premium rates shall be conclusively presumed reasonable in relation to the benefits provided when used for policies containing such benefit provisions.70 Del. Laws, c. 576,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
