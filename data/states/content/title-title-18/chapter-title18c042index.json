This presumption may be rebutted by showing the control does not in fact exist.(6) a. “Covered claim” means an unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, submitted by a claimant, which arises out of and is within the coverage, and subject to the applicable limits, of an insurance policy to which this chapter applies, issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after July 5, 1991, and:1.

Creation of the Association.There is created a nonprofit unincorporated legal entity to be known as the Delaware Insurance Guaranty Association. All insurers, defined as member insurers in § 4205 of this title, shall be and remain members of the Association as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this State. The Association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under § 4209 of this title and shall exercise its powers through a board of directors established under § 4207 of this title.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4206;57 Del. Laws, c. 437.;§\n\n4207. Board of Directors.(a) The Board of Directors of the Association shall consist of not less than 5 nor more than 9 persons serving terms as established in the plan of operation. The members of the Board shall be selected by member insurers subject to the approval of the Commissioner. Vacancies of the Board shall be filled for the remaining period of the term in the same manner as initial appointments. If no members are selected within 60 days after July 1, 1970, the Commissioner may appoint the initial members of the Board of Directors.(b) In approving selections to the Board, the Commissioner shall consider among other things whether all member insurers are fairly represented.(c) Members of the Board may be reimbursed from the assets of the Association for expenses incurred by them as members of the Board of Directors.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4207;57 Del. Laws, c. 437.;§\n\n4208. Powers and duties of the Association.(a) The Association shall:(1) Be obligated to pay valid covered claims existing prior to the order of liquidation of the insolvency and arising within 30 days after the order of liquidation or before the policy expiration date if less than 30 days after the order of liquidation, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if it is done within 30 days of that order of liquidation. Such obligation shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows: (i) the full amount of a covered claim for benefits under a workers’ compensation insurance policy; (ii) an amount not exceeding $10,000 per policy for a covered claim for the return of an unearned premium; (iii) an amount not exceeding $500,000 per claimant for all other covered claims provided that, for the purposes of this limitation, all claims of any kind arising from or relating to bodily injury or death to any person will constitute a single claim, regardless of the number of claims made, or the number of claimants. The Association is not obligated to pay a claimant an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy or coverage from which the claim arises. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a covered claim does not include any claim filed with the Association after the earlier of: (i) 24 months after the date of the order of liquidation or (ii) final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer; provided, however, that a “covered claim” shall include any covered claim of which notice was given to the Association on or prior to June 30, 1991. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, except in the case of a claim for benefits under workers’ compensation coverage, any obligation of the Association to any and all persons shall cease when $10,000,000 shall have been paid in the aggregate by the Association and any 1 or more associations similar to the Association of any other state or states or any property/casualty security fund which obtains contributions from insurers on a pre-insolvency basis, to or on behalf of any insured and its affiliates on covered claims or allowed claims arising under the policy or policies of any 1 insolvent insurer. For purposes of this section, the term “affiliate” shall mean a person who directly, or indirectly, through 1 or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another person. If the Association determines that there may be more than 1 claimant having a covered claim or allowed claim against the Association or any association similar to the Association or any property/casualty insurance security fund in other states, under the policy or policies of any 1 insolvent insurer, the Association may establish a plan to allocate amounts payable by the Association in such manner as the Association in its discretion deems equitable.(2) Be deemed the insurer only to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and, to such extent, subject to the limitations provided in this chapter, shall have all rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.(3) Be relieved of any obligation to defend an insured on a covered claim upon any of the following:a. The Association’s payment, by settlement releasing the insured or on a judgment, of an amount equal to the lesser of the Association’s covered claim obligation limit or the applicable policy limit.b. The Association’s tender of an amount equal to the lesser of the Association’s covered claim obligation limit or the applicable policy limit.(4) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the Association, the Board of Directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each class, at such times and in such amounts as the Board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than 30 days after written notice to the member insurers.a. There shall be 3 classes of assessments as follows:1. Class A assessments shall be made for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other expenses and examinations conducted under the authority of § 4213 of this title.2. Class B assessments shall be made annually to partially subsidize the oversight activities of the Commissioner, thereby minimizing the need for class C assessments.3. Class C assessments shall be made to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the Association under this chapter with regard to an insolvent member insurer.b. The assessments shall be determined as follows:1. The class A assessments will be equal in amount as to each member and may be assessed not more often than once each year. Such assessment shall not exceed $150 annually.2. The class B assessments shall be made annually. The Commissioner shall determine the amount and shall so notify the Association on or before July 31 of each calendar year in which the assessment is to be made. Class B assessments will also be equal in amount as to each member. The said assessments shall be paid to the Insurance Commissioner’s regulatory revolving fund. Not later than October 31 of each said calendar year, the Commissioner shall issue a report to the Association detailing the expenditure of those funds. Amounts not expended will remain in the revolving fund to be used in the succeeding year.3. Class C assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the Association, does not provide in any 1 year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. The Association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which a member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.c. The amounts assessed for class B assessments shall in no event exceed1/10of 1 percent of the members’ premiums for the year on which the assessment is based. The amounts assessed for class B and class C assessments combined shall not result in members being assessed a total B and C assessment amount which exceeds 2 percent of the members’ premiums written in the applicable year.(5) Investigate claims brought against the Association and adjust, compromise, settle and pay covered claims to the extent of the Association’s obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which such settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested.(6) Notify such persons as the Commissioner directs under § 4210(b)(1) of this title.(7) Handle claims through its employees or through 1 or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the Commissioner, but such designation may be declined by a member insurer.(8) Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the Association paid by the facility and expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the Association and pay the other expenses of the Association authorized by this chapter.(9) Issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the Commissioner, for the amount so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the Commissioner may approve.(10) Exercise all powers and do all things authorized by this chapter with respect to a division of a bank or trust company established pursuant to § 767(a) of Title 5 and determined to be insolvent pursuant to § 4205(7) of this title with the same effect as if such department or division was a stock insurer.(b) The Association may:(1) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the Association.(2) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation.(3) Sue or be sued and such power to sue includes the power and right to intervene as a party before any court in this State that has jurisdiction over an insolvent insurer as defined by this chapter. All actions against the Association must be brought in this State. This State shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all actions against the Association.(4) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter.(5) [Repealed.](6) Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to the Association that amount by which the assets of the Association exceed the liabilities if at the end of any calendar year the Board of Directors finds that the assets of the Association exceed the liabilities for the coming year of the Association as estimated by the Board of Directors.(7) Establish procedures for requesting financial information from insureds on a confidential basis for the purpose of determining net worth, subject to such information being shared with any other association similar to the Association and the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer on the same confidential basis. If the insured refuses to provide the requested financial information and an auditor’s certification of the same where requested and available, the Association may deem the net worth of the insured to be in excess of the amounts specified in § 4205(6)b.4. of this title or § 4211(a)(2)a. of this title at the relevant time under the respective section under this title.(8) Bring an action against any third-party administrator, agent, attorney, or other representative of the insolvent insurer to obtain custody and control of all files, records, and electronic data information related to an insolvent company that are appropriate or necessary for the Association, or a similar association in other states, to carry out its duties under this chapter. In such a suit, the Association shall have the absolute right through emergency equitable relief to obtain custody and control of all such information in the custody or control of such third-party administrator, agent, attorney, or other representative of the insolvent insurer, regardless of where such information may be physically located. In bringing such an action, the Association is not subject to any defense, lien (possessory or otherwise), or other legal or equitable ground whatsoever for refusal to surrender such information that might be asserted against the liquidator or receiver of the insolvent insurer. To the extent that litigation is required for the Association to obtain custody of the information requested and it results in the relinquishment of information to the Association after refusal to provide the same in response to a written demand, the court shall award the Association its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney fees incurred in bringing the action. This section does not affect the rights and remedies that the custodian of such information may have against the insolvent insurers, so long as such rights and remedies do not conflict with the rights of the Association to custody and control of the files, records, and electronic data information under this title.(9) Subject to approval by the Commissioner, provide claims-handling services to any “run-off insurer” only if the Association’s expenses related to the provision of the claims-handling services are fully reimbursed. There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, the Association, or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or any person serving as a representative of any director for any action taken or any failure to act by them in the performance of the services under this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph, “run off insurer” means a property and casualty insurer that has any of the following:a. Total adjusted capital under risk based capital requirements in an amount less than the Authorized Control Level RBC as defined in § 5801 of this title as of the date specified in § 5802 of this title for filing of the annual RBC report and has indicated that it will cease writing new insurance policies, either as part of its corrective action plan or pursuant to being placed under regulatory control.b. Total adjusted capital under risk based capital requirements in an amount less than the Mandatory Control Level RBC as defined in § 5801 of this title as of the date specified in § 5802 of this title for the filing of the annual RBC report and that has not been placed into liquidation under § 5906 of this title.(10) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.18 Del.

Plan of operation.(a) (1) The Association shall submit to the Commissioner a plan of operation and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the Association. The plan of operation and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon approval in writing by the Commissioner.(2) If the Association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation by September 29, 1970, or if at any time thereafter the Association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the Commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. Such rules shall continue in force until modified by the Commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the Association and approved by the Commissioner.(b) All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation.(c) The plan of operation shall:(1) Establish the procedures whereby all the powers and duties of the Association under § 4208 of this title will be performed.(2) Establish procedures for handling assets of the Association.(3) Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the Board of Directors under § 4207 of this title.(4) Establish procedures by which claims may be filed with the Association and establish acceptable forms of proof of covered claims. Notice of claims to the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer shall be deemed notice to the Association or its agent and a list of such claims shall be periodically submitted to the Association or similar organization in another state by the receiver or liquidator.(5) Establish regular places and times for meetings of the Board of Directors.(6) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the Association, its agents, and the Board of Directors.(7) Provide that any member insurer aggrieved by any final action or decision of the Association may appeal to the Commissioner within 30 days after the action or decision.(8) Establish the procedures whereby selections for the Board of Directors will be submitted to the Commissioner.(9) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the Association.(d) The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the Association, except those under § 4208(a)(3) and (b)(2) of this title, are delegated to a corporation, association or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this Association, or its equivalent, in 2 or more states. Such a corporation, association or organization shall be reimbursed as a servicing facility would be reimbursed and shall be paid for its performance of any other functions of the Association. A delegation under this subsection shall take effect only with the approval of both the Board of Directors and the Commissioner and may be made only to a corporation, association or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4209;57 Del. Laws, c. 438.;§\n\n4210. Duties and powers of the Commissioner.(a) The Commissioner shall:(1) Notify the Association of the existence of an insolvent insurer not later than 3 days after he or she receives notice of the determination of the insolvency;(2) Upon request of the Board of Directors, provide the Association with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer.(b) The Commissioner may:(1) Require that the Association notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determination of insolvency and of their rights under this chapter. Such notification shall be by mail at their last known address, where available, but if sufficient information for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation shall be sufficient.(2) Suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this State of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation. As an alternative, the Commissioner may levy a fine on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due. Such fine shall not exceed 5% of the unpaid assessment per month, except that no fine shall be less than $100 per month.(3) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility if he or she finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily.(c) Any final action or order of the Commissioner under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4210;57 Del. Laws, c. 437;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4211. Effect of paid claims.(a) (1) Any person recovering under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under the policy to the Association to the extent of the person’s recovery from the Association. Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this chapter shall cooperate with the Association to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The Association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except such causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer and except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the Association shall not operate to reduce the liability of the insureds to the receiver, liquidator or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.(2) The Association shall have the right to recover from the following persons the amount of any covered claim paid on behalf of such person pursuant to this chapter:a. Any insured whose net worth on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer exceeds $25,000,000 and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this chapter; andb. Any person who is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer and whose liability obligations to any other person are satisfied in whole or in part by payment under this chapter. This paragraph (a)(2) shall not apply retroactively and/or retrospectively and shall apply only as to insurer insolvencies which occur on or after June 30, 1991.(b) The receiver, liquidator or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the Association or a similar organization in another state. The court having jurisdiction shall grant such claims priority equal to that to which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this chapter against the assets of the insolvent insurer.(c) The Association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the Association, and estimates of anticipated claims on the Association which shall preserve the rights of the Association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4211;57 Del. Laws, c. 437;68 Del. Laws, c. 112,\n\n§\n\n 6;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 463,\n\n§§\n\n 12-14;72 Del. Laws, c. 400,\n\n§\n\n 3;§\n\n4212. Exhaustion of other coverage.(a) Any person having a claim under an insurance policy shall first exhaust all coverage provided by any such policy, whether or not it is a policy issued by a member insurer, if the claim under such policy arises from the same facts, injury, or loss that gave rise to the covered claim against the Association. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this title shall be reduced by the full applicable limits stated in such insurance policy and the Association shall receive a full credit for such stated limits, or, where there are no applicable stated limits, the claim shall be reduced by the total recovery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person shall be required to exhaust any right under the policy of an insolvent insurer.(1) A claim under an insurance policy providing liability coverage to a person who may be jointly and severally liable or a joint tortfeasor with the person covered under the policy of the insolvent insurer that gives rise to the covered claim shall be considered to be a claim arising from the same facts, injury or loss that gave rise to the covered claim against the Association.(2) For the purposes of this section, a claim against a health maintenance organization, a hospital plan corporation, or a professional health service corporation and any amount payable by or on behalf of a self-insurer will be considered under this section as a claim requiring exhaustion of other coverage if the claim arises from the same facts, injury, or loss that gave rise to the covered claim against the Association.(3) To the extent that the Association’s obligation is reduced by the application of this section, the liability of the person insured by the insolvent insurer’s policy for the claim shall be reduced in the same amount.(b) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than 1 insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residence of the insured, except that, if it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, recovery must be sought first from the association of the location of the property; and if it is a workers’ compensation claim, recovery must be sought first from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any recovery under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.18 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 4212;57 Del. Laws, c. 437;62 Del.
