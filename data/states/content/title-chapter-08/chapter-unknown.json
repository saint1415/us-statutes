Any participating municipality that fails to timely remit its assessment when due may be assessed a penalty of an additional $2,000 by the board.(4) There is created in the office of the State Treasurer a special revenue account fund to be known as the Home Rule Board Operations Fund. The assessments required by the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be deposited into the fund, and expenditures from the fund shall be made in accordance with appropriation of the Legislature under the provisions of §12-3-1 et seq. of this code, and in compliance with the provisions of §11B-2-1 et seq. of this code: Provided, That legislative appropriation is not required during fiscal year 2019.(5) Any balance in the fund created under subdivision (4) of this subsection at the end of a fiscal year shall not revert to the General Revenue Fund but shall remain in the special revenue account for uses consistent with the provisions of this section.(6) All costs and expenses lawfully incurred by the board may be paid from the fund created under subdivision (4) of this subsection.(7) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if at the end of a fiscal year the unencumbered balance of the fund created in subdivision (4) of this subsection is $200,000 or more, then annual assessments shall be suspended until the board determines that the unencumbered balance in the fund is insufficient to meet operational expenses.

      "text": "Application of provisions of this chapter; inconsistent or conflicting special legislative charter provisions; amendment of special legislative charters; inconsistent or conflicting ordinance provisions; status and tenure of officers and members not affected; transactions already entered into not affected.In furtherance of the purpose of this chapter as set forth in section one of this article, each municipality is subject to the provisions contained in this chapter and may exercise the power and authority conferred by this chapter. In this regard, it is recognized that when the provisions of existing special legislative charters are compared with and are considered in the light of the provisions of this chapter, there are five basic possibilities as to the relationship between such charter provisions and the provisions of this chapter, namely: (1) As to any particular charter provisions, such charter provisions may be inconsistent or in conflict with the pertinent provisions of this chapter; (2) although relating to the same subject matter and although not inconsistent or in conflict with any provisions of this chapter, certain charter provisions may be sufficiently different from pertinent provisions of this chapter as to indicate, as a matter of practical construction, that either the charter provisions or the provisions of this chapter, but not both, should be applicable; (3) although varying in certain respects, certain charter provisions may be similar to and in essential harmony with corresponding provisions of this chapter; (4) as to any particular charter provisions, there may be no counterpart of such provisions in this chapter; and (5) as to any provisions of this chapter, there may be no counterpart charter provisions. In view of these possibilities, it becomes necessary for the Legislature to set forth certain rules of construction to be applied in addition to the usual and ordinary rules of statutory construction, and to set forth a substantive provision as to application in connection with possibility (2).As to possibility (1), the pertinent provisions of this chapter shall supersede such conflicting or inconsistent charter provisions and shall be deemed amendments to such charters. As to possibility (2), one year from and after the effective date of this section or the effective date of any pertinent amendment to this chapter hereafter adopted, such provisions of this chapter shall supersede such charter provisions and shall be deemed amendments to such charter, unless within such one-year period an ordinance is adopted providing that such charter provisions shall be applicable, in which event such charter provisions shall be applicable so long as said ordinance remains in full force and effect. As to possibility (3), all such charter provisions shall be construed so as to conform to and be consistent with the pertinent provisions of this chapter. As to possibility (4), the charter provisions shall remain in operation and effect until amended or repealed by general law hereafter enacted or until hereafter supplanted by a new charter or revised as a whole or amended in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. As to possibility (5), the applicable provisions of this chapter shall be deemed amendments to such charter. In determining the relationship between such charter provisions and the provisions of this chapter in any situation not included in the possibilities outlined above, the relationship shall be determined in keeping with the general concepts and principles embodied in the rules of construction set forth in this paragraph. The provisions set forth above in this paragraph shall also be applicable to the relationship between the pertinent provisions of various local or special acts of the Legislature (other than special legislative charters) pertaining to municipal matters and the provisions of this chapter.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, (1) particular provisions of this chapter shall supersede pertinent charter provisions whenever it is expressly provided in this chapter that such provisions of this chapter shall govern notwithstanding any charter provisions, that such charter provisions shall be of no force and effect, that the provisions of this chapter are the only applicable provisions, or that something may be accomplished only as provided in this chapter; and (2) charter provisions shall govern chapter provisions in those instances where this chapter expressly authorizes other or contrary charter provisions.Any ordinance provision which is inconsistent or in conflict with any provision of this chapter shall be of no force and effect.All individuals holding any office on the effective date of this chapter, and all officers and members of any commission, board, authority or other entity, by whatever name called, serving on the effective date of this chapter, and who were elected or appointed and qualified under or pursuant to the provisions of former chapter eight or chapter eight-a of this code, any act repealed by this new chapter eight or any charter provision or ordinance provision made or adopted under or pursuant to such former chapters or acts shall continue to serve, unless a vacancy sooner occurs, until their terms expire and until their successors have been elected or appointed, as the case may be, and have qualified.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions or any other provision of this chapter (even though such other provision is stated to be paramount), transactions validly entered into, causes of action which arose, and civil actions instituted, before the effective date of this chapter and the rights, duties, obligations and interest flowing therefrom remain valid, enforceable and maintainable thereafter and may be terminated, completed, consummated, prosecuted, maintained or enforced (1) as required or permitted by any statute or other law (including the provisions of former chapters eight and eight-a of this code and the acts repealed by this chapter) repealed or amended by this chapter as though such repeal or amendment had not occurred, or (2) with like effect as though this chapter had not been enacted.",

If such demand is made, the ordinance shall be read in full as demanded.(2) At least five days before the meeting at which a proposed ordinance, the principal object of which is the raising of revenue for the municipality, is to be finally adopted, the governing body shall cause notice of the proposed adoption of the proposed ordinance to be published as a Class I-0 legal advertisement in compliance with §59-3-1et seq. of this code, and the publication area for the publication shall be the municipality. The notice shall state the subject matter and general title or titles of the proposed ordinance, the date, time, and place of the proposed final vote on adoption, and the place or places within the municipality where the proposed ordinance may be inspected by the public. A reasonable number of copies of the proposed ordinance shall be kept at such place or places and be made available for public inspection.

After adoption of the ordinance, the code or codes shall be certified by the mayor and shall be filed as a permanent record in the office of the recorder, who may not be required to transcribe and record the code in the ordinance book as other ordinances are transcribed and recorded. Consistent with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, it is not necessary that any such ordinance, either as proposed or after adoption, be published in any newspaper, and it is not necessary that the code itself be so published, but before final adoption of any such proposed ordinance, notice of the proposed adoption of the ordinance and code shall be given by publication as herein provided for ordinances the principal object of which is the raising of revenue for the municipality, which notice shall also state where, within the municipality, the code or codes will be available for public inspection.(c) By a charter framed and adopted, revision of a charter as a whole, or a charter amendment or amendments, as the case may be, subsequent to the effective date of this section, a city may require any or all ordinances to be published in a newspaper prior to the adoption thereof, may expressly adopt the provisions of this section, may specify other additional requirements for the enactment of ordinances, or may prescribe a procedure for the enactment of ordinances in greater detail than prescribed in this section, but a city may not, except in an emergency as specified in subsection (d) of this section or except as otherwise provided in this code, lessen or reduce the requirements of this section.(d) The governing body of a municipality may enact an ordinance without complying with the rules prescribed in this section only: (1) In the case of a pressing public emergency making procedure in accordance with the provisions of this section dangerous to the public health, safety, or morals, and by affirmative vote of two thirds of the members elected to the governing body; or (2) when otherwise provided in this code.

      "text": "Findings.The Legislature finds that:(a) Imposing additional taxes creates an extra burden on the citizens of the state;(b) Imposing additional taxes can be detrimental to the economy of the state;(c) Imposing additional taxes is only proper under certain circumstances;(d) For many municipalities with severe unfunded liabilities of the police and fire pension funds, all available sources of local revenue have been exhausted. Property taxes are at the maximum allowed by the state Constitution and local business and occupation taxes and utility taxes are at the maximum rates allowed by state law. Other fees have reached the economic maximum and are causing relocation of business outside the municipal boundaries;(e) For many municipalities with severe unfunded police and fire pension fund liabilities, revenue from existing sources has become stagnant over the past few years with no expectation of significant future growth;(f) For many municipalities with severe unfunded police and fire pension fund liabilities, payments required under state law to fund fire and police pension funds are now close to equaling the city payrolls for police and fire protection and will rise to exceed those payrolls within a ten-year period;(g) For many municipalities with severe unfunded police and fire pension fund liabilities, payments required under state law to fund fire and police pension funds now constitute a large percentage of those municipalities' total budget and will rise to an even larger percentage of the available revenues in the next ten years. Payment and benefit levels are dictated to the municipalities by state law;(h) As the required pension payments rise, many of the municipalities with severe unfunded police and fire pension fund liabilities will find it impossible to maintain at minimum levels necessary and proper city services including, but not limited to, police and fire protection, street maintenance and repair and sanitary services;(i) For some of the municipalities with severe unfunded liabilities of the police and fire pension funds, the combination of the steeply rising pension obligations and the stagnant revenue sources raise the real possibility of municipal bankruptcy in the near and predictable future. If this happens, pensioners would either not receive the full benefits which they have been promised or pressure would be placed on the state to fund these programs;(j) For a municipality that has the most severe unfunded liability in its pension funds, paying off the unfunded liability in a timely manner would cause tremendous financial hardship and the loss of many services that would otherwise be provided to the municipality's citizens;(k) Only for a municipality that has the most severe unfunded liability in its pension funds would the imposition of the pension relief municipal occupational tax, the pension relief municipal sales and service tax, the pension relief municipal use tax or any combination of those taxes be an appropriate method of addressing the unfunded liability;(l) Only for a municipality that does not impose or ceases to impose a business and occupation or privilege tax would the imposition of an alternative municipal sales and service tax and an alternative municipal use tax be appropriate;(m) Only for a municipality that has the most severe unfunded liability in its pension funds would the closure of its existing pension and relief fund plan for policemen and firemen to those newly employed and the creation of a defined contribution plan for newly employed policemen and firemen be appropriate; and(n) Only for a municipality that has the most severe unfunded liability in its pension funds, that closes its existing pension and relief fund plan for policemen and firemen to those newly employed and that creates a defined contribution plan for newly employed police officers and firefighters, would the issuance of bonds to address the unfunded liability of its existing pension and relief fund plan for policemen and firemen be appropriate.(o) No amendment to this article enacted during the third extraordinary session of the Legislature held during calendar year 2005 may be interpreted or construed to allow a municipality to adopt by ordinance a sales or use tax, by whatever name called, that imposes either tax prior to July 1, 2008.",

The provider of water facilities is empowered and authorized hereby to discontinue water service upon demand of the municipality for this purpose; however, prior to discontinuance of any water service, the municipality shall contract with the provider of water facilities which contract shall provide that the municipality shall reimburse the provider of water facilities for all costs and expenses incurred in both the termination of water service to the delinquent user of sewer facilities and the subsequent resumption of water service to such user. The contract shall provide for reasonable methods and assurances so that the provider of water facilities will be protected and held harmless from claims and damages when water service is discontinued in error or in violation of the rights of the user through the fault of the municipality providing sewer facilities and making the demand for discontinuance of water service to the user of such sewer facilities. Any contract made for this purpose shall have the approval of the Public Service Commission prior to its execution and performance. Any disconnection of water service must comply with all rules, regulations and orders of the Public Service Commission.(b) Whenever any rates and charges for services or facilities furnished remain unpaid for a period of thirty days after the same become due and payable, the user of the services and facilities provided shall be delinquent and the user shall be held liable at law until such time as all such rates and charges are fully paid.(c) All rates and charges whenever delinquent, as provided by ordinance of the municipality, shall, when notice thereof is duly recorded in the office of the clerk of the county commission wherein the subject real property is situate, be liens of equal dignity, rank and priority with the lien on such premises of state, county, school and municipal taxes for the amount thereof upon the real property served, and the municipality shall have plenary power and authority from time to time to enforce such lien in a civil action to recover the money due for such services rendered plus court fees and costs and a reasonable attorney's fee: Provided, That an owner of real property may not be held liable for the delinquent rates or charges for services or facilities of a tenant, nor shall any lien attach to real property for the reason of delinquent rates or charges for services or facilities of a tenant of such real property, unless the owner has contracted directly with the municipality to purchase such services or facilities.(d) Municipalities are hereby granted a deferral of filing fees or other fees and costs incidental to the bringing and maintenance of an action in magistrate court for the collection of the delinquent rates and charges. If the municipality collects the delinquent account, plus fees and costs, from its customer or other responsible party, the municipality shall pay to the magistrate court the filing fees or other fees and costs which were previously deferred.(e) No municipality may foreclose upon the premises served by it for delinquent rates and charges for which a lien is authorized by this section except through the bringing and maintenance of a civil action for such purpose brought in the circuit court of the county wherein the municipality lies. In every such action, the court shall be required to make a finding based upon the evidence and facts presented that the municipality had exhausted all other remedies for the collection of debts with respect to such delinquencies prior to the bringing of such action. In no event shall foreclosure procedures be instituted by any municipality or on its behalf unless such delinquency has been in existence or continued for a period of two years from the date of the first such delinquency for which foreclosure is being instituted.",

The governing body of a municipality also has the plenary power and authority to make, enact, and enforce all necessary rules and ordinances for the care and protection of any such system for the health, comfort, and convenience of the public, to provide a clean water supply, to provide properly treated sewage insofar as it is reasonably possible to do and, if applicable, properly collecting and controlling the stormwater as is reasonably possible to do:Provided,That no municipality may make, enact, or enforce any rule, regulation, or ordinance regulating any highways, road or drainage easements, or storm water facilities constructed, owned or operated by the West Virginia Division of Highways.(2) A municipality has the plenary power and authority to charge the users for the use and service of a combined system and to establish required deposits, rates, fees, or charges for such purpose. Separate deposits, rates, fees, or charges may be fixed for the water and sewer services respectively and, if applicable, the stormwater services, or combined rates, fees or for the combined water and sewer services, and, if applicable, the storm water services. Such deposits, rates, fees or charges, whether separate or combined, shall be sufficient at all times to pay the cost of repair, maintenance, and operation of the combined system, provide an adequate reserve fund, an adequate depreciation fund and pay the principal and interest upon all revenue bonds issued under this article. Deposits, rates, fees, or charges shall be established, revised, and maintained by ordinance and become payable as the governing body may determine by ordinance. The rates, fees, or charges shall be changed, from time to time, as necessary, consistent with the provisions of this article:Provided,That the notice given by the municipality for a change in rates or charges to be charged for the services from the waterworks or electric power system, shall be provided by Class I legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in its service territory not less than one week prior to the public hearing of the governing body of the municipality required for the approval of the change in rates or charges.(3) All new applicants for service shall indicate to the municipality or governing body whether they are an owner or tenant with respect to the service location. An entity providing stormwater service shall provide a tenant a report of the stormwater fee charged for the entire property and, if appropriate, that portion of the fee to be assessed to the tenant.(4) The municipality or governing body, but only one of them, may collect from all new applicants for service a deposit of $100 or two twelfths of the average annual usage of the applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is greater, to secure the payment of water and sewage service rates, fees, and charges in the event they become delinquent as provided in this section. In any case where a deposit is forfeited to pay service rates, fees, and charges which were delinquent and the user’s service is disconnected or terminated, service may not be reconnected or reinstated by the municipality or governing body until another deposit equal to $100 or a sum equal to two twelfths of the average usage for the applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is greater, is remitted to the municipality or governing body. After 12 months of prompt payment history, the municipality or governing body shall return the deposit to the customer or credit the customer’s account with interest at a rate to be set by the Public Service Commission:Provided,That where the customer is a tenant, the municipality or governing body is not required to return the deposit until the time the tenant discontinues service with the municipality governing body. Whenever any rates, fees, rentals, or charges for services or facilities furnished remain unpaid for a period of 20 days after they become due, the user of the services and facilities provided is delinquent and the user is liable at law until all rates, fees, and charges are fully paid. The municipality or governing body may terminate water services to a delinquent user of either water or sewage facilities, or both, 10 days after the water or sewage services become delinquent regardless of whether the governing body utilizes the security deposit to satisfy any delinquent payments:Provided, however,That any termination of water service must comply with all rules and orders of the Public Service Commission:Provided further, That nothing contained within the rules of the Public Service Commission requires agents or employees of the municipality or governing body to accept payment at the customer’s premises in lieu of discontinuing service for a delinquent bill.(b) Whenever any rates, fees, or charges for services or facilities furnished remain unpaid for a period of 20 days after they become due, the user of the services and facilities provided shall be delinquent and the municipality or governing body may apply any deposit against any delinquent fee. The user is liable until such time as all rates, fees, and charges are fully paid.(c) All rates, fees, or charges for water service, sewer service and, if applicable, stormwater service, whenever delinquent, as provided by ordinance of the municipality, shall be liens of equal dignity, rank, and priority with the lien on such premises of state, county, school, and municipal taxes for the amount thereof upon the real property served. The municipality has the plenary power and authority to enforce such lien in a civil action to recover the money due for services rendered plus court fees and costs and reasonable attorney’s fees:Provided,That an owner of real property may not be held liable for the delinquent rates, fees, or charges for services or facilities of a tenant, nor shall any lien attach to real property for the reason of delinquent rates, fees, or charges for services or facilities of a tenant of the real property, unless the owner has contracted directly with the municipality to purchase such services or facilities.(d) Municipalities are hereby granted a deferral of filing fees or other fees and costs incidental to filing an action in magistrate court for collection of the delinquent rates and charges. If the municipality collects the delinquent account, plus fees and costs, from its customer or other responsible party, the municipality shall pay to the magistrate court the filing fees or other fees and costs which were previously deferred.(e) No municipality may foreclose upon the premises served by it for delinquent rates, fees, or charges for which a lien is authorized by this section except through a civil action in the circuit court of the county wherein the municipality lies. In every such action, the court shall be required to make a finding based upon the evidence and facts presented that the municipality has exhausted all other remedies for collection of debts with respect to such delinquencies prior to bringing the action. In no event shall foreclosure procedures be instituted by any municipality or on its behalf unless the delinquency has been in existence or continued for a period of two years from the date of the first delinquency for which foreclosure is being sought.(f) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this article, a municipality which has been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as an entity to serve a West Virginia Separate Storm Sewer System community, as defined in 40 C.F.R. §122.26, has the authority to enact ordinances or regulations which allow for the issuance of orders, the right to enter properties and the right to impose reasonable fines and penalties regarding correction of violations of municipal stormwater ordinances or regulations within the municipal watershed served by the municipal stormwater system, as long as such rules, regulations, fines, or acts are not contrary to any rules or orders of the Public Service Commission.(g) Notice of a violation of a municipal stormwater ordinance or regulation shall be served in person to the alleged violator or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall state the nature of the violation, the potential penalty, the action required to correct the violation and the time limit for making the correction. Should a person, after receipt of proper notice, fail to correct violation of the municipal stormwater ordinance or regulation, the municipality may correct or have the corrections of the violation made and bring the party into compliance with the applicable stormwater ordinance or regulation. The municipality may collect the costs of correcting the violation from the person by instituting a civil action, as long as such actions are not contrary to any rules or orders of the Public Service Commission.(h) A municipality which has been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as an entity to serve a West Virginia Separate Storm Sewer System community shall prepare an annual report detailing the collection and expenditure of rates, fees, or charges and make it available for public review at the place of business of the governing body and the stormwater utility main office.",

The amount deposited in a municipal policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall be irrevocably contributed, accumulated, and invested as fund assets as described in §8-22-22 and §8-22-22a of this code. The amount deposited with the trustee of an issue of pension funding revenue bonds shall be used for the purpose of paying debt service on such bonds. One 12th of each municipality’s annual contributions shall be deposited with the municipality’s pension trust funds as fund assets on at least a monthly basis and any revenues received from any source by a municipality which are specifically collected for the purpose of allocation for deposit into the policemen’s pension and relief fund or firemen’s pension and relief fund shall be so deposited within five days of receipt by the municipality. A municipality may prepay its monthly required contributions in increments greater than 1/12. Heretofore surplus reserves accumulated before the effective date of this section shall be irrevocably contributed, aggregated, and invested as fund assets described in §8-22-22 and §8-22-22a of this code. Any actuarial deficiency arising under this section and §8-22-20 of this code shall not be the obligation of the State of West Virginia.(2) The levies authorized under the provisions of this section, or any part of them, may by the governing body be laid in addition to all other municipal levies and, to that extent, beyond the limit of levy imposed by the charter of the municipality; and the levies shall supersede and if necessary exclude levies for other purposes, where other purposes have not already attained priority, and within the limitations on taxes or tax levies imposed by the constitution and laws.(b) The public corporations are authorized to take by gift, grant, devise, or bequest any money or real or personal property on such terms as to the investment and expenditures thereof as may be fixed by the grantor or determined by the trustees.(c) In addition to all other sums provided for pensions in this section, it is the duty of every municipality in which any fund or funds have been or shall be established to assess and collect from each member of the paid police department or paid fire department or both each month, the sum of seven percent of the actual salary or compensation of such member; and the amount so collected shall become a regular part of the policemen’s pension and relief fund, if collected from a policeman, and of the firemen’s pension and relief fund, if collected from a fireman:Provided,That for members of the funds who are police officers or firefighters newly hired on or after January 1, 2010, the municipality shall assess and collect nine and one-half percent of the actual salary or compensation. Only those funds for which the board of trustees has collected and paid the contributions as herein provided and meeting minimum standards for actuarial soundness shall be eligible to receive moneys from the additional fire and casualty insurance premium tax as provided in §33-3-14d of this code:Provided, however, That the board of trustees for each pension and relief fund may assess and collect from each member of the paid police department or paid fire department or both each month not more than an additional two and one-half percent of the actual salary or compensation of each member, but not to exceed nine and one-half percent total contribution:Provided further, That if any board of trustees decides to assess and collect any additional amount pursuant to this subdivision above the member contribution required by this section, then that board of trustees may not reduce the additional amount until the respective pension and relief fund no longer has any actuarial deficiency:And provided further, That if any board of trustees decides to assess and collect any additional amount, any board of trustees decision and any additional amount is not the liability of the State of West Virginia. Member contributions shall be deposited in the pension and relief fund within five days of being collected. In the event that a municipality’s building commission has issued pension funding revenue bonds, then the trustee for such bonds shall only be eligible to receive money from the additional fire and casualty insurance premium tax in §33-3-14d of this code if the board of trustees for the policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds for which such bonds have been issued has collected and paid the contributions as herein provided and is meeting minimum standards for actuarial soundness.(d)(1) For the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2010, and subject to provisions of §8-22-18b and §33-3-14d of this code and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Municipal Pensions Oversight Board shall receive and retain the moneys allocated to the Municipal Pensions Security Fund until such time as the treasurer of the municipality applies for the allocable portion and certifies in writing to Municipal Pensions Oversight Board that:(A) The municipality has irrevocably contributed the amount required under this section and §8-22-20 of this code to the pension and relief fund for the required period; and, as applicable, the trustee for the pension funding revenue bonds has filed with the governing body of the municipality and the oversight board a report showing all debt service payments have been made with previously received proceeds from the municipality and the allocable portion of the premium tax allocation received from the Municipal Pensions Security Fund for the preceding twelve months: and(B) The board of trustees of the pension and relief fund has made a report to the governing body of the municipality and to the oversight board on the condition of its fund with respect to the fiscal year.(2) When the aforementioned application and certification are made, the allocable portion of moneys from the Municipal Pensions Security Fund shall be paid to the corresponding policemen’s or firemen’s pension and relief fund or, if pension funding revenue bonds have been issued by such municipality’s building commission and remain outstanding, to the trustee for such pension funding revenue bonds. Payment to a municipal pension and relief fund or to the trustee for pension funding revenue bonds, as applicable, shall be made by electronic funds transfer.(e) The State Auditor and the oversight board have the power, and the duty as each considers necessary, to perform or review audits on the pension and relief funds or to employ an independent consulting actuary or accountant to determine the compliance of the aforementioned certification with the requirements of this section and §8-22-20 of this code. The expense of the audit or determination shall be paid from the Municipal Pensions Security Fund pursuant to provisions of §8-22-18b of this code. If the allocable portion of the Municipal Pensions Security Fund is not paid to the pension and relief fund or to the trustee for pension funding revenue bonds, as applicable, within 18 months, the portion is forfeited by the pension and relief fund and is allocable to other eligible municipal policemen’s and firemen’s pension and relief funds in accordance with §33-3-14d of this code.",

In no event are provisions of this subsection to be interpreted to permit retirement before age fifty unless the interruption of the member's service by duty with the armed forces of the United States actually occurred before July 1, 1981.

Upon retirement under the provisions of this subsection, such member shall receive retirement pension benefits payable in twelve monthly installments for each year of the remainder of the member's life in an amount equal to sixty percent of such member's average annual salary or compensation received during the three twelve-consecutive-month periods of employment with such department in which such member received the member's highest salary or compensation while a member of the department, or an amount of $500 per month, whichever is greater.

For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:(1) \"Eligible rollover distribution\" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any of the following: (A) Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or the joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (B) any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (C) any hardship distribution described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i(iv) of the Internal Revenue Code. A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, this portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred (including interest or earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution which is not includable, or to a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code.(2) \"Eligible retirement plan\" means an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into the plan from this plan, an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution, or a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code: Provided, That in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a designated beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) as the term is defined in Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible retirement plan is limited to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity which meets the conditions of Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code.(3) \"Distributee\" means an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to governmental plans, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. The term \"distributee\" also includes a designated beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) as the term is defined in Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code.(4) \"Direct rollover\" means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan.",

In the case of a report for a proposed historic district, the commission shall submit with the report a map showing boundaries of the proposed district. The West Virginia department of culture and history may prepare written comments within forty-five days on the report.In the event that any such ordinance or order establishing the commission has authorized the commission to issue certificates of appropriateness, the local governing body shall hold a public hearing on the proposed designation of the historic property or historic district, and any proposed regulations and requirements for the historic district. Notice of the hearing shall be published at least two times in the principal newspaper of general circulation within the municipality or county in which the property or properties to be designated are located; and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by certified mail with signed return receipt required by the commission to all owners and occupants of such properties. All the notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten nor more than twenty days prior to the date set for the public hearing.

Within thirty days following such designation or approval, the owners and occupants of each designated historic property shall be given written notification of such designation or approval by the local governing body, which notice shall apprise said owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in the appearance of the historic landmark designated or within an historic district.In the event any such order or ordinance establishing a commission does not authorize the commission to regulate historic properties through issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the survey report may be adopted by the commission, with any recommended amendments or changes by the state agency, and the historic landmark or historic district shall be designated as historic.Any such designated historic landmark or district designated by this article shall be shown on the official zoning map of the county or municipality or, that in the absence of an official zoning map, the designated property be shown on a map of the county or municipality and kept by the county or municipality as a public record to provide notice of such designation in addition to other such notification requirements of this section.",

The purposes for which revenue bonds may be issued may include the payment of all costs and estimated costs incidental to or connected with the accomplishment of such purpose or project including, without limitation, engineering, inspection and legal fees, the fees of fiscal agents and financial consultants and other fees, bond and other reserve funds, working capital, bond interest estimated to accrue during the construction period and for a period not to exceed two years thereafter, and expenses of all proceedings for the authorization, issuance and sale of the bonds.The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall bear interest at such rate or rates as are approved by the authority, payable semiannually, and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any banking institution or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the president of the authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority, or a facsimile thereof, shall be impressed or imprinted thereupon and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the president of the authority. All such signatures, countersignatures and seal may be printed, lithographed or mechanically reproduced, except that one of such signatures or countersignatures on the bonds shall be manually affixed, unless the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds shall otherwise provide. If any officer whose signature or countersignature or a facsimile of whose signature or countersignature appears on bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, his signature shall be as effective as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as each authority may determine and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone, and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. Notwithstanding the form or tenor thereof, and in the absence of any express recital on the face thereof that the bond is nonnegotiable, all such bonds shall be, and shall be treated as, negotiable instruments for all purposes except when registered in the name of a registered owner.The authority may exchange its bonds, in whole or in part, for any system or systems, or any parts thereof, or facilities and equipment therefor, or may sell its bonds, in whole or in part, in such manner either at public or private sale and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this article and be for the best interest of the authority: Provided, That if the bonds be issued the minimum price for which they may be exchanged or at which they may be sold shall be such that the interest cost to the authority of the proceeds of the bonds shall not exceed the interest rate per annum thereon computed to maturity according to the standard table of bond values.Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.The authority is hereby empowered and authorized to provide by resolution, from time to time, for the issuance, sale or exchange of revenue refunding bonds of such authority for the purpose of refunding any bonds then outstanding which shall have been issued under the provisions of this article, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon, and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of such bonds, and the payment of all expenses incidental thereto. The authority is further empowered and authorized to provide by resolution, from time to time, for the issuance, sale or exchange of revenue bonds of such authority for the combined purpose of refunding any bonds then outstanding, as herein provided, and paying all or any part of the cost of any additional project or projects. All provisions of this article applicable to the issuance of revenue bonds are applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds and to the sale or exchange thereof.",
