In determining whether to revoke probation or parole, the court or Parole Board shall consider the defendant’s employment status, earning ability, financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant’s failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant’s ability to pay.(h) An order of restitution may be enforced by the state or a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the court may order, in addition to or in lieu of, restitution, that a defendant be required to contribute monetarily, or through hours of service, to a local crime victim’s assistance program or juvenile mediation program which meets the following requirements:(1) The program is approved by a circuit judge presiding in the judicial circuit; and(2) The program is a nonprofit organization certified as a corporation in this state, and is governed by a board of directors.",
