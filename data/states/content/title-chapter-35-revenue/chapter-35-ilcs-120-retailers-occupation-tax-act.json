When a\nmotor vehicle is returned for a refund of the purchase price under the New\nVehicle Buyer Protection Act, the Department shall issue a credit memorandum\nor a refund for the amount of tax paid by the retailer under this Act\nattributable to the initial sale of that vehicle. Claims submitted by the\nretailer are subject to the same restrictions and procedures provided for in\nthis Act.\nIf it is determined that the Department\nshould issue a credit memorandum or refund, the Department may first apply\nthe amount thereof against any tax or penalty or interest due or to become\ndue under this Act or under the Use Tax Act, the Service Occupation Tax\nAct, the Service Use Tax Act,\nany local occupation or use tax administered by the Department,\nSection 4 of the Water Commission Act of\n1985, subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Section 5.01 of the Local Mass\nTransit District Act, or subsections (e), (f) and (g) of Section 4.03 of\nthe Regional Transportation Authority Act, from the person who made the\nerroneous payment. If no tax or penalty or interest is due and no\nproceeding is pending to determine whether such person is indebted to the\nDepartment for tax or penalty or interest, the credit memorandum or refund\nshall be issued to the claimant; or (in the case of a credit memorandum)\nthe credit memorandum may be assigned and set over by the lawful holder\nthereof, subject to reasonable rules of the Department, to any other person\nwho is subject to this Act, the Use Tax Act, the Service Occupation Tax Act,\nthe Service Use Tax Act,\nany local occupation or use tax administered by the Department,\nSection 4 of the Water Commission Act of\n1985, subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Section 5.01 of the Local Mass\nTransit District Act, or subsections (e), (f) and (g) of Section 4.03 of\nthe Regional Transportation Authority Act,\nand the amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax or\npenalty or interest due or to become due under this Act or under the Use\nTax Act, the Service Occupation Tax Act, the Service\nUse Tax Act,\nany local occupation or use tax administered by the Department,\nSection 4 of the Water Commission Act of\n1985, subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Section 5.01 of the Local Mass\nTransit District Act, or subsections (e), (f) and (g) of Section 4.03 of\nthe Regional Transportation Authority Act, from such assignee. However, as\nto any claim for credit or refund filed with the Department on and after\neach January 1 and July 1 no amount of tax or penalty or interest\nerroneously paid (either in total or partial liquidation of a tax or\npenalty or amount of interest under this Act) more than 3 years prior to\nsuch January 1 and July 1, respectively, shall be credited or refunded,\nexcept that if both the Department and the taxpayer have agreed to an\nextension of time to issue a notice of tax liability as\nprovided in Section 4 of this Act, such claim may be filed at any time\nprior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act to the contrary, for any period included in a claim for credit or refund for which the statute of limitations for issuing a notice of tax liability under this Act will expire less than 6 months after the date a taxpayer files the claim for credit or refund, the statute of limitations is automatically extended for 6 months from the date it would have otherwise expired.",
