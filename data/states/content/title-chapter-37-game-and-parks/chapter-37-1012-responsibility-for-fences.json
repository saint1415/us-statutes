The adjoining landowner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the fence. In such areas the type of fence may be (a) wire fence of at least four barbed wires, of a size not less than twelve and one-half gauge fencing wire, to be secured to posts, the posts to be at no greater distance than one rod from each other, or (b) a fence of any type that is agreed to by the commission and adjoining landowners.
