The presumption may be rebutted only by a showing with clear and convincing evidence that the certification is false or fraudulent and that the contractor knew that the certification was false or fraudulent before execution of the contract.\n\n(Acts 1961, No. 868, p. 1361, §1; Acts 1997, No. 97-225, p. 348, §1.)",
