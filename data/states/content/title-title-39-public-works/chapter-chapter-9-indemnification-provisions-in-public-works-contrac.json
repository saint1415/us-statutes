It is the intent of this chapter to promote competition and safety relating to road or bridge contracts by requiring a party to be responsible for any and all damages, losses, or injuries, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and other litigation costs, caused by the party.\n\n(Act 2021-244, §1.)",
