General referendum; creation of authority; certificate and recording; certification of information to Secretary of State.(a) (1) After a favorable majority referendum vote at a special election in the municipality or in each of the municipalities creating an authority, which referendum election shall be held on the same date in each of such municipalities, the governing body of a municipality or the governing bodies of 2 or more municipalities may by ordinances or resolutions signify their intention to create an authority to acquire, construct, reconstruct, extend, repair, improve, maintain and operate a project under an appropriate name and title, containing the word “authority,” which shall be a public body politic and corporate.(2) Notice of the holding of such referendum election shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of each municipality and published once a week for at least 3 consecutive weeks in at least 1 newspaper circulating in the municipality. Such notice shall set out in summary form the purpose, the date and place of holding the referendum election and the hours the polls will be open.(3) At said referendum election every resident and nonresident taxable of the municipality of the age of 21 years or upwards who has, by the time of voting, paid all municipal taxes theretofore assessed to the taxable resident or nonresident and/or assessed against the property the taxable resident or nonresident owns at the time of the referendum election shall be entitled to vote and shall have 1 vote for each dollar, or fractional part of a dollar, of taxes paid by the taxable resident or nonresident according to the last municipal assessment and tax payment records preceding the referendum election. The judge of the election shall note on the outside of each ballot, before the judge deposits the ballot in the ballot box, the number of votes to which each voter is entitled, in accordance with municipal assessment and tax payment records.(4) In cases of jointly owned property the votes of the owners of shares therein shall be in accordance with their respective shares or, if all owners appear at the polls and so consent, all of the votes may be cast by the owner of any share, except that the spouse first present at the polls may cast all the votes in reference to property held by a married couple as tenants by the entirety. Life tenants shall have the entire vote as to the property so held and holders of remainder interest only shall have no vote by reason thereof.(5) The clerk of each municipality shall provide sufficient ballots which shall have printed thereon “For” and “Against.” The election shall be conducted in conformity with the provisions governing general elections as provided in Chapter 49 of Title 15.(b) Each such ordinance or resolution shall include articles of incorporation which shall set forth:(1) The name of the “authority;”(2) A statement that such authority is formed under this chapter;(3) The name of the incorporating municipality or municipalities;(4) The names, addresses and terms of office of the first members of the board of said authority and, if the governing body of the municipality determines that its members shall constitute the board of said authority, a statement to that effect;(5) The purpose or purposes for which the authority is to be created or is created.(c) The articles of incorporation shall be executed by each incorporating municipality by its proper officers and shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall receive the same and endorse thereon the date and time of such receipt. If the Secretary of State finds that the articles of incorporation conform to law, the Secretary of State shall forthwith endorse the Secretary of State’s own approval thereon and issue a certificate of approval to which shall be attached a copy of the approved articles. Upon the issuance of such certificate of approval by the Secretary of State, the corporate existence of said authority shall begin and thereupon such authority shall be conclusively deemed to have been lawfully and properly created and established and authorized to exercise its powers under this chapter. Promptly thereafter the Secretary of State shall record said articles of incorporation, together with the endorsements thereon, in a book to be kept for that purpose.(d) When the authority has been organized and its officers elected, the secretary shall certify to the Secretary of State the names and addresses of its officers as well as the principal office of the authority. Any change in the location of the principal office shall likewise be certified to the Secretary of State within 10 days after such change.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1402;49 Del. Laws, c. 417;53 Del.

Amendment of articles of incorporation.Every authority of this State may, from time to time and in the manner hereinafter provided, amend its articles of incorporation and thereby accomplish any 1 or more of the following: The adoption of a new name, changes in, additions to and diminutions of its powers and purposes, provided that such amendment shall contain only such provisions as it would be lawful or proper to insert in articles of incorporation made at the time of such amendment.16 Del.

Withdrawal or joinder of municipalities; procedure.(a) Whenever an authority has been incorporated by 2 or more municipalities, any 1 or more of such municipalities may withdraw therefrom and any municipality not having joined in the original incorporation may join in the authority, but no municipality shall be permitted to withdraw from any authority after an obligation has been incurred by the authority.(b) Any municipality wishing to withdraw from or to become a member of an existing authority shall signify its desire by resolution or ordinance after an enabling referendum. If the authority shall by resolution express its consent to such withdrawal or joining, articles of withdrawal or articles of joinder, as the case may be, shall be executed by the proper officers of the withdrawing or incoming municipality and shall be joined by the proper officers of the governing body of the authority and, in the case of a municipality seeking to become a member of the authority, also by the proper officers of each of the municipalities that are then members of the authority, pursuant to resolutions or ordinances by the governing bodies of such municipalities. In the case of a certificate of joinder, the certificate shall set forth all of the information required in the case of original incorporation insofar as it applies to the incoming municipality including the name and address and term of office of the first member of the board of the authority from the incoming municipality. Articles of withdrawal and articles of joinder shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall receive the same and endorse thereon the date and time of such receipt. If the Secretary of State finds that the articles of withdrawal or articles of joinder, as the case may be, conform to law, the Secretary of State shall forthwith endorse the Secretary of State’s own approval thereon and issue a certificate of approval to which shall be attached a copy of the approved articles. Upon the issuance of such certificate of approval by the Secretary of State, said articles of withdrawal or articles of joinder, as the case may be, shall become effective and be in full force and effect, and such articles shall be conclusively deemed to have been lawfully and properly adopted.

Exercise of powers by governing body; composition; quorum; personnel; salaries; records.(a) The powers of each authority shall be exercised by a governing body (herein called the “board”) composed as follows:(1) If the authority is incorporated by 1 municipality, the board shall be composed of the members of the governing body of the municipality creating the authority or shall be composed of 5 citizens of such municipality, as the governing body of such municipality shall determine. If the governing body of the municipality creating the authority determines that the said board shall be composed of the members of said governing body, the terms of office of the members of said board shall coincide with their terms of office as members of the governing body and any member of said governing body shall automatically be a member of said board and shall cease to be a member of said board upon ceasing to be a member of said governing body. If the governing body of the municipality creating an authority shall determine that the board shall consist of 5 citizens, the governing body of such municipality shall appoint the members of the board, whose terms of office shall commence on the date of appointment and 1 of whom shall serve for 1 year, 1 for 2 years, 1 for 3 years, 1 for 4 years and 1 for 5 years from the January 1 next succeeding the date of incorporation, and thereafter the said governing body shall, at a meeting held not later than 1 month prior to January 1 in each year in which a vacancy occurs, appoint as a member of the board a citizen of the municipality for which the authority is created for a term of 5 years to succeed the member whose term expires on the January 1st next succeeding.(2) If the authority is incorporated by 2 or more municipalities, the board shall consist of a number of members at least equal to the number of municipalities incorporating the authority, but in no event less than 5. When 1 or more additional municipalities join an existing authority, each of such joining municipalities shall have 1 member on the board. The first of such members shall be appointed immediately upon the admission of the municipality into the authority for a full term of years equal to that fixed for the other members of the board. The members of the board shall be appointed, their terms staggered and vacancies filled, and where the number of municipalities joining is less than 5, shall be apportioned in such manner as the articles of incorporation shall provide. No member shall be appointed for a term longer than 5 years.(b) Members of the board who are not members of the governing body of the municipality or municipalities composing the authority shall hold office until their successors have been appointed, and may succeed themselves, and shall receive such salaries as may be determined by the governing body or bodies of the municipality or municipalities, but none of such salaries shall be increased or diminished by such governing body or bodies during the term for which the member receiving the same shall have been appointed. Members of the board who are members of the governing body of a municipality shall serve as board members without pay. If a vacancy shall occur by reason of the death, disqualification, resignation or removal of an appointed member, the governing body of the municipality shall appoint a successor to fill the member’s unexpired term. In joint authorities such vacancies shall be filled by the governing body of the municipality in the representation of which the vacancy occurs. Whenever any municipality shall withdraw from a joint authority the term of any member or members appointed from such municipality shall immediately terminate.(c) A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum of the board for the purpose of organizing the authority and conducting the business thereof and for all other purposes, and all action may be taken by vote of a majority of the members present, unless in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number. The board shall have full authority to manage the properties and business of the authority and to prescribe, amend and repeal bylaws, rules and regulations governing the manner in which the business of the authority may be conducted, and the powers granted to it may be exercised and embodied. The board shall fix and determine the number of officers, agents and employees of the authority and their respective powers, duties and compensation and may appoint to such office or offices any members of the board with such powers, duties and compensation as the board may deem proper.(d) Every such officer appointed shall be adequately bonded.(e) Each authority shall keep a complete and true record of its receipts, expenses and expenditures and shall employ a certified or licensed public accountant to audit its books and accounts. Each authority shall always keep available and open to public inspection during business hours, at its principal office, a detailed audit and financial statement of its accounts. Each authority shall file annually with the governing body or governing bodies of the municipality or municipalities composing the authority a certified copy of such detailed audit and financial statement. The governing body of the municipality composing an authority, or in the case of an authority composed of 2 or more municipalities the governing body of each such municipality, may at any time in person or by its duly authorized agent or agents audit and examine the books and records of such authority; provided, however, that such audit or examination shall be without cost to said authority.(f) Notwithstanding anything in Title 8 or anything in the certificate of incorporation of an authority to the contrary notwithstanding, a member of the Board may be removed at any time and without cause by act of the governing body of the municipality responsible for appointing that Board member.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1405;49 Del. Laws, c. 417;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;79 Del. Laws, c. 132,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n1406.

Any person questioning the reasonableness or uniformity of any rate, fee or charge fixed by an authority may bring suit against the authority;(12) To enter into contracts with the federal government, the State, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or with any municipality, private corporation, copartnership, association or individual providing for or relating to the furnishing of services and facilities of any project of the authority or in connection with the services and facilities rendered by any water system or sewerage system owned or controlled by the federal government or the State, any agency or instrumentality thereof, and any municipality, private corporation, copartnership, association or individual;(13) To contract with any municipality, county, corporation, individual or any public authority of this or any adjoining state, on such terms as the said authority shall deem proper, for the construction and operation of any project which is partly in this State and partly in such adjoining state;(14) To make and enter into all contracts or agreements, as the authority may determine, which are necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties and to the execution of the powers granted by this chapter, including contracts with any federal agency or with any municipality, on such terms and conditions as the authority may approve, relating to (i) the use by such agency or by such municipality or the inhabitants thereof of any project acquired or constructed by the authority under this subsection or the services therefrom or the facilities thereof, or (ii) the use by the authority of the services or facilities of any water system or sewerage system owned or operated other than by the authority.

Any such contract may provide for the collecting of fees, rates or charges for the services and facilities rendered to a municipality or to the inhabitants thereof by such municipality or by its agents or by the agents of the authority, and for the enforcement of delinquent charges for such services and facilities. The provisions of any such contract and of any ordinance or resolution of the governing body of a municipality enacted pursuant thereto shall be irrepealable so long as any of the revenue bonds issued under the authority of this chapter shall be outstanding and unpaid, and the provisions of any such contract and of any ordinance or resolution enacted pursuant thereto shall be and be deemed to be for the benefit of such bondholders. The aggregate of any fees, rates or charges which shall be required to be collected pursuant to any such contract or any ordinance or resolution enacted thereunder shall be sufficient to pay all obligations which may be assumed by the other contracting party;(15) To enter upon, use, occupy and dig up any street, road, highway or private or public lands necessary to be entered upon, used or occupied in connection with the acquisition, construction or improvement, maintenance or operation of a project, subject, however, to such reasonable local police regulation as may be established by the governing body of any municipality having jurisdiction in the particular respect;(16) To receive and accept from any federal agency grants for or in aid of the construction, acquisition or operation of any project, and to receive and accept aid or contributions from any source of either money, property, labor or other things of value to be held, used and applied only for the purposes for which such grants and contributions may be made;(17) To charge a reasonable tapping fee whenever the owner of any property connects such property with a water or sewer system operated by the authority, which fee shall be in addition to any rental or use charges assessed by the authority;(18) In the event of any annexation by a municipality not a member of the authority of lands, areas or territory served by the authority, to continue to do business, exercise its jurisdiction over its properties and facilities in and upon or over such lands, areas or territory as long as any bonds or indebtedness remain outstanding or unpaid, or any contracts or other obligations remain in force.16 Del.

Limits of powers.None of the powers granted by this chapter shall be exercised in the construction, improvement, maintenance, extension or operation of any project or projects which in whole or in part shall duplicate or compete with existing utilities, public or private, serving substantially the same purposes. The municipality or municipalities organizing such an authority may, in the resolution or ordinance signifying their intention so to do, or from time to time by subsequent resolution or ordinance, specify the project or projects to be undertaken by the said authority, and no other projects shall be undertaken by the said authority than those so specified. If the municipality or municipalities organizing an authority fail to specify the project or projects to be undertaken, then the authority shall be deemed to have all the powers granted by this chapter.No municipality which shall have created an authority under this chapter shall thereafter create any other authority serving the whole or any part of the same area. No municipality which shall have joined with any other municipality or municipalities in the creation of any authority under this chapter shall thereafter create or join in the creation of any other authority unless such other municipality or municipalities shall consent thereto by ordinance or resolution after a general referendum.16 Del.

The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds.(3) The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company.(4) In case any officer, whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery.(5) All revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall have and are declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments laws of the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest.(6) The issuance of such bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or conditions contained in any other law and the authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or at private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be in the best interests of the authority and the municipality to be served thereby.(b) (1) The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects on account of which such bonds are issued and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement hereafter mentioned securing the same.(2) If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose.(3) If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been issued, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the reserve account or sinking fund for such bonds.(c) (1) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery.(2) The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost.(d) Bonds may be issued under this chapter without obtaining the approval or consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the State and without any other proceeding or the happening of any other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.(e) The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds of the authority and any trust agreement securing such bonds may contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the authority may deem proper, and such additional revenue bonds shall be issued under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement.16 Del.

Issuance of revenue bonds — Faith and credit of State or political subdivisions as unaffected.Revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any political subdivision thereof. All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the effect that neither the faith and credit of the State nor the faith and credit of any county, city, town or other subdivision of the State are pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of revenue bonds under this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State or any county, city, town or other subdivision of the State to levy any taxes whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment except from the funds pledged under this chapter.16 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1409;49 Del. Laws, c. 417.;§\n\n1410. Exemption of projects from taxes.No authority shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any project acquired, constructed or operated by it under this chapter or upon the income therefrom, and the bonds issued under this chapter, their transfer and the income therefrom (including any profit made on the sale thereof) shall at all times be free from taxation by the State or any of its political subdivisions or by any town or incorporated municipality or any other public agency within the State.16 Del.
