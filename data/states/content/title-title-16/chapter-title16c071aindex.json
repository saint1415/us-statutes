Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7117. Test method and performance standard.(a) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, no cigarettes may be sold or offered for sale in this State or offered for sale or sold to persons located in this State unless such cigarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and meet the performance standard specified in this subsection; and a written certification has been filed by the manufacturer with the State Fire Marshal in accordance with § 7118 of this title, and the cigarettes have been marked in accordance with § 7119 of this title.(1) Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard E2187-04 “Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.”(2) Testing shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper.(3) No more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial in accordance with this subsection shall exhibit full-length burns. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested.(4) The performance standard required by this subsection shall only be applied to a complete test trial.(5) Written certification shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or other comparable accreditation standard required by the State Fire Marshal.(6) Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19.(7) This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with this chapter for any other purpose.(8) Testing performed or sponsored by the State Fire Marshal to determine a cigarette’s compliance with the performance standard required shall be conducted in accordance with this section.(b) Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to § 7118 of this title that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in this section shall have at least 2 nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least 1 complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design there shall be at least 2 bands fully located at last 15 millimeter from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for a nonfiltered cigarette.(c) The manufacturer or manufacturers of a cigarette that the State Fire Marshal determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in subsection (a) of this section shall propose a test method and performance standard for such cigarette to the State Fire Marshal. Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the State Fire Marshal that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer or manufacturers is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the manufacturer or manufacturers may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to § 7118 of this title. If the State Fire Marshal determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this chapter, and the State Fire Marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that state’s law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, then the State Fire Marshal shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in this State, unless the State Fire Marshal demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under this chapter. All other applicable requirements of this section shall apply to such manufacturer or manufacturers.(d) In order to ensure compliance with the performance standard specified in subsection (a) or (c) of this section, data from testing conducted by manufacturers to comply with this performance standard shall be kept on file by such manufacturers for a period of 3 years and shall be sent to the State Fire Marshal upon its request, and to the Office of the Attorney General upon its request. Any manufacturer who fails to make copies of these reports available within 60 days of receiving a written request shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day after the sixtieth day that the manufacturer does not make such copies available.(e) The State Fire Marshal may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring Ignition Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that such subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard E2187-04.(f) As of January 1, 2010, and at least every 3 years thereafter, the State Fire Marshal shall undertake a review of the effectiveness of this chapter and report its findings to the legislature. Based upon such review, the State Fire Marshal may recommend legislation to improve the effectiveness of this chapter. The report and legislative recommendations shall be submitted no later than June 30 following the conclusion of each 3-year period.(g) The requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall not prohibit:(1) Wholesale or retail dealers from selling their existing inventory of cigarettes on or after January 1, 2009, if the wholesale or retailer dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes prior to January 1, 2009, and if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was purchased prior to January 1, 2009, in comparable quantity to the inventory purchased during the same period of the prior year.(2) The sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing. For purposes of this subsection, the term “consumer testing” shall mean an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by a manufacturer (or under the control and direction of a manufacturer), for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of such cigarettes, utilizing only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for such assessment, and in a controlled setting where the cigarettes are either consumed on-site or returned to the testing administrators at the conclusion of testing.(h) This chapter shall be implemented in accordance with the implementation and substance of the New York Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes.76 Del. Laws, c. 100,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7118. Certification of compliance by manufacturers.(a) Each manufacturer shall submit to the State Fire Marshal a written certification attesting that:(1) Each cigarette listed in the certification has been tested in accordance with § 7117 of this title;(2) Each cigarette listed in the certification meets the performance standard set forth under § 7117(a)(3) of this title;(3) Each cigarette listed in the certification shall be described with the following information:a. Brand (i.e., the trade name on the package);b. Style (i.e., light, ultra light);c. Length in millimeters;d. Circumference in millimeters;e. Flavor (e.g., menthol, chocolate), if applicable;f. Filter or nonfilter;g. Package description (e.g., soft pack, box);h. Marking approved in accordance with § 7119 of this title.i.

Each cigarette certified under this section shall be recertified every 3 years.(c) For each cigarette listed in a certification a manufacturer shall pay to the State Fire Marshal a $250 fee. The State Fire Marshal shall have the power to adjust this fee to an amount sufficient only to provide for processing, testing, enforcement and oversight activities related to this chapter.(d) There is hereby established in the custody of the State Comptroller a special nonlapsing fund to be known as the “Cigarette Fire Safety and Firefighter Protection Act Enforcement Fund.” Such fund shall consist of all certification fees submitted by manufacturers, and shall, in addition to any other moneys made available for such purpose, be available to the State Fire Marshal’s Office and shall be used solely to support State processing testing, enforcement and oversight activities related to this chapter. All payments from the Cigarette Fire Safety and Firefighter Protection Act Enforcement Fund shall be made on the audit and warrant of the State Treasurer on vouchers certified and submitted by the State Fire Marshal.(e) If a manufacturer has certified a cigarette pursuant to this section, and thereafter makes any change to such cigarette that is likely to alter its compliance with the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards required by this chapter, that cigarette shall not be sold or offered for sale in this State until the manufacturer retests the cigarette in accordance with the testing standards set forth in § 7117 of this title and maintains records of that retesting as required by § 7117 of this title. Any altered cigarette which does not meet the performance standard set forth in § 7117 of this title may not be sold in this State.76 Del. Laws, c. 100,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7119.

Such mark may consist of alphanumeric or symbolic character or characters permanently stamped, engraved, embossed or printed in conjunction with the UPC code; or(2) Any visible combination of alphanumeric or symbolic character or characters permanently stamped, engraved, or embossed upon the cigarette package or cellophane wrap; or(3) Printed, stamped, engraved or embossed test that indicates that the cigarettes meet the standards of this section; or(4) The letters “FSC,” which signifies Fire Standards Compliant appearing in 8-point type or larger and permanently printed, stamped, engraved or embossed on the package at or near the UPC code.(b) A manufacturer must use only 1 marking and must apply this marking uniformly for all packages (including, but not limited to, packs, cartons and cases) and brands marketed by that manufacturer.(c) The State Fire Marshal must be notified as to the marking that is selected.(d) Prior to the certification of any cigarette, a manufacturer shall present its proposed marking to the State Fire Marshal for approval. Upon receipt of the request, the State Fire Marshal shall approve or disapprove the marking offered, except that the State Fire Marshal shall approve:(1) Any marking in use and approved for sale in New York State pursuant to New York Fire Safety Standard for Cigarettes, or(2) The letters “FSC,” which signifies Fire Standards Compliant appearing in 8 point type or larger and permanently printed, stamped, engraved or embossed on the package at or near the UPC code.(e) Proposed markings shall be deemed approved if the State Fire Marshal fails to act within 10 business days of receiving a request for approved.(f) No manufacturer shall modify its approved marking unless the modification has been approved by the State Fire Marshal in accordance with this § 7119.(g) Manufacturers certifying cigarettes in accordance with § 7118 of this title shall provide a copy of such certifications to all wholesale dealers and agents to which they sell cigarettes, and shall also provide sufficient copies of an illustration of the package markings utilized by the manufacturer pursuant to this § 7119 for each retailer to which the wholesale dealers or agents sell cigarettes. Wholesale dealers and agents shall provide a copy of these package markings received from manufacturers to all retail dealers to which they sell cigarettes. Wholesale dealers, agents and retail dealers shall permit the State Fire Marshal, the Director of the Division of Revenue, the Office of the Attorney General, or employees thereof, to inspect markings of cigarette packaging marked in accordance with this section.76 Del. Laws, c. 100,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n7120.
