However, the third prong of the test, whether the material has artistic value, is subject to de novo review because it does not depend on community standards. Tipp-It, Inc. v. Conboy, 257 Neb. 219, 596 N.W.2d 304 (1999).The definition of obscenity provided in this section is patterned upon, and coextensive with, the language of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). State v. Harrold, 256 Neb. 829, 593 N.W.2d 299 (1999).Films which have little plot and which consist of scene after scene of sexual intercourse, lesbianism, homosexuality, cunnilingus, and fellatio are obscene as that term is defined. State v. Embassy Corp., 215 Neb. 631, 340 N.W.2d 160 (1983).Subsection (10) of this statute is not unconstitutionally vague. State v. Embassy Corp., 215 Neb. 631, 340 N.W.2d 160 (1983).",
