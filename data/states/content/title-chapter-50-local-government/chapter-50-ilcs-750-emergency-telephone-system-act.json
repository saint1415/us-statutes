There currently exist thousands of different emergency\nphone numbers throughout the state, and present telephone exchange\nboundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond\nto public safety and political boundaries. Provision\nof a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency\nservices can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant\ncontribution to law enforcement and other public service efforts by making\nit less difficult to quickly notify public safety personnel. Such a\nsimplified means of procuring emergency services will result in the saving\nof life, a reduction in the destruction of property, quicker apprehension\nof criminals, and ultimately the saving of money. The General Assembly\nfurther finds and declares that the establishment\nof a uniform, statewide emergency number is a matter of statewide\nconcern and interest to all inhabitants and citizens of this State. It is the\npurpose of this Act to establish the number \"9-1-1\" as the primary emergency\ntelephone number for use in this State and to encourage units of local\ngovernment and combinations of such units to develop and improve emergency\ncommunication procedures and facilities in such a manner as to be able to quickly respond\nto any person calling the telephone number \"9-1-1\" seeking\npolice, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.",
