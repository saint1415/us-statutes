Services charges against that\nperson take effect on the date of admission or the effective date of this\nSection. The Department in its rules may establish a maximum\nrate for the cost of services. In the case of any person who has received\nresidential services from the Department, whether directly from the Department\nor through a public or\nprivate agency or entity funded by the Department, the liability shall be the\nsame regardless of the source of services. When the person is placed in a\nfacility outside the Department, the facility shall collect reimbursement from\nthe person. The Department may supplement the contribution of the person to\nprivate facilities after all other sources of income have been utilized;\nhowever the supplement shall not exceed the allowable rate under Title XVIII\nor Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act for those persons eligible for\nthose respective programs. The Department may pay the actual costs of services\nor maintenance in the facility and may collect reimbursement for the entire\namount paid from the person or an amount not to exceed the maximum. Lesser or\ngreater amounts may be accepted by the Department when conditions warrant that\naction or when offered by persons not liable under this Act. Nothing in this\nSection shall preclude the Department from applying federal benefits that are\nspecifically provided for the care and treatment of a person with a disability toward\nthe cost of care provided by a State facility or private agency. The\nDepartment\nmay investigate the financial condition of each\nperson committed under this Act, may make determinations of the ability of each\nsuch person to pay sums representing services charges, and for those purposes\nmay set a standard as a basis of judgment of ability to pay. The Department\nshall by rule make provisions for unusual and exceptional circumstances in the\napplication of that standard. The Department may issue to any person liable\nunder this Act a statement of amount due as treatment charges requiring him or\nher to\npay monthly, quarterly, or otherwise as may be arranged, an amount not\nexceeding that required under this Act, plus fees to which the Department may\nbe entitled under this Act.",
