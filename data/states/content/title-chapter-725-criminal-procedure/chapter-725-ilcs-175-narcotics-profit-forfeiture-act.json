Racketeering schemes persist\ndespite the threat of prosecution and the actual prosecution and imprisonment\nof individual participants because existing sanctions do not effectively\nreach the money and other assets generated by such schemes. It is therefore\nnecessary to supplement existing sanctions by mandating forfeiture of money\nand other assets generated by narcotics racketeering activities. Forfeiture\ndiminishes the financial incentives which encourage and sustain narcotics\nracketeering, and secures for the People of the State of Illinois assets\nto be used for enforcement of laws governing narcotics activity.",
