While forfeiture may secure for State and local units of government\nsome resources for deterring drug abuse and drug trafficking, forfeiture is\nnot intended to be an alternative means of funding the administration of\ncriminal justice. The General Assembly further finds that the federal\nnarcotics civil forfeiture statute upon which this Act is based has been\nvery successful in deterring the use and distribution of controlled\nsubstances within this State and throughout the country. It is therefore\nthe intent of the General Assembly that the forfeiture provisions of this\nAct be construed in light of the federal forfeiture provisions contained in\n21 U.S.C. 881 as interpreted by the federal courts, except to the extent\nthat the provisions of this Act expressly differ therefrom.",
