      "text": "Section 26-23E-2\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds all of the following:\n\n(1) That the percentage of abortion or reproductive health centers that have been subject to adverse licensure action vastly exceeds the percentage of facilities in any other category that have similarly been subject to adverse licensure actions. This alarming level of regulatory non-compliance among abortion and reproductive health centers in Alabama puts abortion patients at unreasonable risk.\n\n(2) At abortion or reproductive health centers, patients are often treated in a manner inconsistent with a traditional physician/patient relationship.\n\n(3) Abortion or reproductive health centers are not operated in the same manner as ambulatory surgical treatment centers or physician offices.\n\n(4) Abortion involves not only a surgical procedure with the usual risks attending surgery, but also involves the taking of human life.\n\n(5) Abortion is a highly personal and very sensitive procedure which results in stress and concern for the patient that is unique to the decision to have an abortion.\n\n(6) Abortion is a very profitable procedure most often engaged in by stand-alone clinics without many of the safeguards found in a traditional physician/patient relationship or other medical care setting.\n\n(7) Because abortion and reproductive health centers do not currently provide the level of personal contact found in many physician/patient relationships and in other medical care settings, it is necessary for the Legislature to mandate the personal presence and participation of the physician in the process.\n\n(8) Moreover, because abortion or reproductive health centers have often failed to meet acceptable standards of medical care, it is necessary for Legislature to enact reasonable and medically appropriate health and safety standards for all abortion and reproductive health centers, and to provide effective enforcement mechanisms and disincentives for centers that are unable or unwilling to meet these requirements.\n\n(Act 2013-79, p. 165, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 26-23E-3\n\nDefinitions.\n\nAs used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) ABORTION. The use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance or device with the intent to terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant with knowledge that the termination by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child. Such use or prescription is not an abortion if done with the intent to save the life or preserve the health of an unborn child, remove a dead unborn child, or to deliver the unborn child prematurely in order to preserve the health of both the mother (pregnant woman) and her unborn child. The term abortion as used in this chapter, does not include a procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman with an ectopic pregnancy, nor does it include the procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman when the unborn child has a lethal anomaly. For the purposes of this chapter, a lethal anomaly means that the child would die at birth or be still born. For the purposes of this chapter, the term, ectopic pregnancy, means any pregnancy resulting from a fertilized egg that has implanted or attached outside the uterus. The term, ectopic pregnancy, also includes a pregnancy resulting from a fertilized egg implanted inside the cornu of the uterus.\n\n(2) ABORTION INDUCING DRUG. A medicine, drug, or any other substance prescribed or dispensed with the intent of terminating the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman, with the knowledge that the termination will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child. Use of such drugs to induce abortion is also known as medical abortion. This includes off-label use of drugs known to have abortion-inducing properties, which are prescribed specifically with the intent of causing an abortion, such as misoprostol (Cytotec), and methotrexate. This definition does not apply to drugs that may be known to cause an abortion, but which are prescribed for other medical indications, such as chemotherapeutic agents and diagnostic drugs.\n\n(3) ABORTION OR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTER. A facility defined and regulated as an abortion or reproductive health center by the rules of the Alabama State Board of Health.\n\n(4) ADMINISTER. To give or apply a pharmacologic or other therapeutic agent to a patient.\n\n(5) DISPENSE. To sell, distribute, administer, leave with, give away, dispose of, deliver, or supply a drug or medicine to the ultimate user or the user’s agent.\n\n(6) PHYSICIAN. A person currently licensed by the Medical Licensure Commission, State of Alabama, to practice medicine or osteopathy pursuant to Section 34-24-50, et seq.\n\n(7) PRESCRIPTION. A physician’s order for the preparation and administration of a drug or device for a patient.\n\n(8) REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL NURSE (RN). A person currently licensed in the State of Alabama pursuant to Section 34-21-21.\n\n(Act 2013-79, p. 165, §3.)",

The discharge order must be signed by the physician.

While the minor child may refuse to provide the father’s name and age, she should be encouraged to do so by the physician or agent consistent with the physician’s legal obligation to reduce the incidence of child abuse when there is reason to suspect that it has occurred.\n\n(b) In addition to any other abuse reporting requirements that may apply to the staff of an abortion or reproductive health center, if the reported age of the father is two or more years greater than the age of the minor child, the facility shall report the names of the pregnant minor child and the father to both local law enforcement and the county department of human resources. If the pregnant minor child is less than 14 years old, the name of the minor child shall be reported to the Department of Human Resources, regardless of whether the father is two or more years older than the minor child. The receipt of reportable information by any member of a facility staff shall trigger the requirement for the facility to report such information.
