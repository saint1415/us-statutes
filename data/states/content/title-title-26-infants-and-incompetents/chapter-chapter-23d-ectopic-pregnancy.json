The term also includes a pregnancy resulting from a fertilized egg implanted inside the cornu of the uterus.\n\n(b) The term abortion, when used in the Code of Alabama 1975, or in the Alabama Administrative Code, shall not be construed to include any procedure to terminate an ectopic pregnancy, unless the statutory provision or rule expressly states that it is intended to apply to a procedure to terminate an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n(c) The requirement of Section 26-23B-4, for a physician to make a determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child prior to an abortion shall apply only to abortion procedures. The requirements of Section 22-9A-13, for reporting fetal deaths and pregnancy terminations shall be construed to require a report of the probable post-fertilization age only for abortion procedures.\n\n(Act 2012-261, p. 506, §§1-3.)",
