      "text": "Section 26-23A-2\n\nLegislative Findings; Purpose.\n\n(a) The Legislature of the State of Alabama finds that:\n\n(1) It is essential to the psychological and physical well-being of a woman considering an abortion that she receive complete and accurate information on her alternatives.\n\n(2) Most abortions are performed in clinics devoted solely to providing abortions and family planning services. Most women who seek abortions at these facilities do not have any relationship with the physician who performs the abortion, before or after the procedure. Most women do not return to the facility for post-surgical care. In most instances, the woman’s only actual contact with the physician occurs simultaneously with the abortion procedure, with little opportunity to receive counseling concerning her decision.\n\n(3) The decision to abort is an important, and often a stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences. The medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting or life threatening.\n\n(b) Based on the findings in subsection (a), it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that every woman considering an abortion receives complete information on the procedure, risks, and her alternatives and to ensure that every woman who submits to an abortion procedure does so only after giving her voluntary and informed consent to the abortion procedure.\n\n(Act 2002-419, p. 1074, §2.)",
