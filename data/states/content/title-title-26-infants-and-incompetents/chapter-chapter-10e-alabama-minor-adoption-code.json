The entry of a final judgment denying a contest terminates the status of the contestant as a party to the adoption proceedings and terminates the contestant’s right to notice of further adoption proceedings.\n\n(e) At the contested hearing, the court shall consider any motion of the petitioner or petitioners to obtain reimbursement for all reasonable medical and living expenses incidental to the care and well-being of the adoptee for the time the adoptee resided with the petitioner or petitioners. If the adoption is denied, the probate court, unless just cause is shown otherwise by the contestant, shall order such reimbursement.\n\n(f)(1) Following the entry of a final judgment denying a petition for adoption, the court shall enter a temporary custody order determining each of the following:\n\na. Whether it is in the best interests of the minor child for the petitioner or petitioners to retain custody of the minor child or for the minor child to be returned to the person or agency with legal custody of the minor child prior to the filing of the petition.\n\nb. Whether a written report should be sent to the county department of human resources pursuant to Chapter 14 of Title 26 for a further determination concerning custody.\n\n(2) The custody determination shall remain in effect only until another court of competent jurisdiction enters a custodial order regarding the minor child.\n\n(g) Upon denial of a contest, the court, unless just cause is shown otherwise by the contestant, shall issue an order for reimbursement to the petitioner or petitioners of the legal costs incurred by each petitioner incidental to the contest.\n\n(Act 2023-92, §1.)",
