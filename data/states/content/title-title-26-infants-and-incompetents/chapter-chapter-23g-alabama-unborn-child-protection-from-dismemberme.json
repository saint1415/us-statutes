      "text": "Section 26-23G-2\n\nDefinitions.\n\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) ABORTION. The same as defined in Section 26-21-2.\n\n(2) ATTEMPT TO PERFORM AN ABORTION.\n\na. To do or omit to do anything that, under the circumstances as the actor believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the actor performing an abortion. Such substantial steps include, but are not limited to, any of the following:\n\n1. Agreeing with an individual to perform an abortion on that individual or on some other individual, whether or not the term abortion is used in the agreement, and whether or not the agreement is contingent on another factor, such as receipt of payment or a determination of pregnancy.\n\n2. Scheduling or planning a time to perform an abortion on an individual, whether or not the term abortion is used, and whether or not the performance is contingent on another factor, such as receipt of payment or a determination of pregnancy.\n\nb. This definition may not be construed to require that an abortion procedure actually be initiated for an attempt to occur.\n\n(3) DISMEMBERMENT ABORTION. With the purpose of causing the death of an unborn child, purposely to dismember a living unborn child and extract him or her one piece at a time from the uterus through use of clamps, grasping forceps, tongs, scissors, or similar instruments that, through the convergence of two rigid levers, slice, crush, or grasp, or any combination of the foregoing, a portion of the unborn child’s body to cut or rip it off. This definition does not include an abortion which uses suction to dismember the body of the developing unborn child by sucking fetal parts into a collection container. This definition includes an abortion in which a dismemberment abortion is used to cause the death of an unborn child and suction is subsequently used to extract fetal parts after the death of the unborn child.\n\n(4) PHYSICIAN. An individual licensed to practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and surgery, or otherwise legally authorized to perform an abortion in the state.\n\n(5) PURPOSELY. An individual acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense when:\n\na. If the element involves the nature of his or her conduct or a result thereof, it is his or her conscious objective to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\n\nb. If the element involves the attendant circumstances, he or she is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he or she believes or hopes that they exist.\n\n(6) SERIOUS HEALTH RISK TO THE UNBORN CHILD’S MOTHER. In reasonable medical judgment, the child’s mother has a condition that so complicates her medical condition that it necessitates the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions. No such condition may be determined to exist if it is based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\n\n(7) WOMAN. A female human being, whether or not she has reached the age of majority.\n\n(Act 2016-397, §2.)",

Upon a motion of the individual accused, the court shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit the hearing to take place.\n\n(c) No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be thereby liable for performing or attempting to perform a dismemberment abortion.

The court, upon motion or sua sponte, shall make such a ruling and, upon determining that her anonymity should be preserved, shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard her identity from public disclosure. Each order shall be accompanied by specific written findings explaining why the anonymity of the woman should be preserved, why the order is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and why no reasonable less restrictive alternative exists. In the absence of written consent of the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted to be performed, anyone other than a public official who brings an action under Section 26-23G-4 or Section 26-23G-5 shall do so under a pseudonym.
