      "text": "Section 26-23B-2\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature makes all of the following findings:\n\n(1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the unborn child’s entire body by no later than 16 weeks after fertilization and nerves link these receptors to the brain’s thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks.\n\n(2) By eight weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example by recoiling.\n\n(3) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when painful stimuli is applied without such anesthesia.\n\n(4) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress response.\n\n(5) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.\n\n(6) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.\n\n(7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.\n\n(8) In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.\n\n(9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.\n\n(10) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from thrashing about in reaction to invasive surgery.\n\n(11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.\n\n(12) It is the purpose of this state to assert a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.\n\n(13) Alabama’s compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of Alabama’s compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither state interest is intended to replace the other.\n\n(14) Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating abortion, the United States Supreme Court noted that an explicit statement of legislative intent specifically made applicable to a particular statute is of greater weight than a general savings or severability clause, it is the intent of this state that if any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is found to be unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of this act shall remain effective notwithstanding such unconstitutionality. Moreover, this state declares that it would have passed this act, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words, or any of their applications, were to be declared unconstitutional.\n\n(Act 2011-672, p. 1784, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 26-23B-3\n\nDefinitions.\n\nFor purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) ABORTION. The use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance or device to terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth, to preserve the life or health of the child after live birth, or to remove a dead unborn child who died as the result of natural causes in utero, accidental trauma, or a criminal assault on the pregnant woman or her unborn child, and which causes the premature termination of the pregnancy.\n\n(2) ATTEMPT TO PERFORM OR INDUCE AN ABORTION. An act, or an omission of a statutorily required act, that, under the circumstances as the actor believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the performance or induction of an abortion in this state in violation of this chapter.\n\n(3) FERTILIZATION. The fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human ovum.\n\n(4) MEDICAL EMERGENCY. A condition which, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of the pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy without first determining postfertilization age to avert her death or for which the delay necessary to determine postfertilization age will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions. No condition shall be deemed a medical emergency if based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\n\n(5) POSTFERTILIZATION AGE. The age of the unborn child as calculated from the fertilization of the human ovum.\n\n(6) REASONABLE MEDICAL JUDGMENT. A medical judgment that would be made by a reasonable prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved.\n\n(7) PHYSICIAN. Any person licensed to practice medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and surgery in this state.\n\n(8) PROBABLE POSTFERTILIZATION AGE OF THE UNBORN CHILD. What, in reasonable medical judgment, will with reasonable probability be the postfertilization age of the unborn child at the time the abortion is planned to be performed or induced.\n\n(9) UNBORN CHILD or FETUS. An individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.\n\n(10) WOMAN. A female human being whether or not she has reached the age of majority.\n\n(Act 2011-672, p. 1784, §3.)",

In making such a determination, the physician shall make such inquiries of the woman and perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical conditions involved, would consider necessary to perform in making an accurate diagnosis with respect to postfertilization age.\n\n(b) Failure by any physician to conform to any requirement of this section constitutes unprofessional conduct.\n\n(Act 2011-672, p. 1784, §4.)",
