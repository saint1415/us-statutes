If space is available in a public building, the lease will be negotiated for placement in the public building;(4)If the Real Estate Services Section determines that adequate space is not available in public buildings, the Real Estate Services Section shall act as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this section to obtain adequate space from a privately owned facility;(5)(A)(i)The secretary shall adopt standards and criteria for the leasing and utilization of space and the allocation of space to state agencies.(ii)These standards and criteria shall be used as a basis for all planning, leasing of space, allocation of space to state agencies, or advising state agencies on leasing considerations.(iii)These standards and criteria shall include, but not be limited to, equipment, work stations, private offices, conference rooms, reception areas, general equipment, vaults, and the necessary space to ensure adequate and effective circulation within and access to all state agencies, including parking and traffic patterns.(B)In cities and towns having a population of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) according to the last federal decennial census, for those state agencies providing direct public access services, preference shall be granted to lease space located in existing buildings in the central business district, as defined by the locality's planning commission, or, in the absence thereof, by the municipality's governing body, except in cases where location within the central business district would impair or restrict the intent of the services being provided to the public or the state's proximity to other state or nongovernmental services or where rental rates justify other locations;(6)Leases as to office space, buildings, structures, parking lots, and grounds from private individuals, firms, and corporations by state agencies and component parts thereof shall be on a standard lease form approved by the secretary. The standard lease form shall contain all terms and conditions deemed necessary based on the type and purpose of the leased property.
