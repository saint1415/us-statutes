Upon the death of the surviving spouse of the grantor or decedent, the fiduciary shall pay the estate taxes attributable to the share trust(s) to which an allocation of the GST exemption is made from any other share trust created hereunder to which no GST exemption is allocated, or from one of the other share trusts created hereunder, unless the trust instrument or the will of the surviving spouse specifically provides otherwise; provided, however, that to the extent possible, estate taxes shall not be paid in the manner provided above if to do so could result in an increase in the property subject to the GST on account of such payment of estate taxes. Other terms and provisions of each such separate share trust created from the QTIP trust shall, when taken together as a whole, be substantially identical to the original QTIP trust. In general, this section contemplates that a fiduciary will divide the original QTIP trust into two or more separate share trusts when it may be desirable to allocate both the GST exemption of the grantor or decedent and the GST exemption of the surviving spouse of such grantor or decedent to the original QTIP trust or a share thereof. Moreover, this section contemplates that a fiduciary will pay the estate taxes attributable to the original QTIP trust from a share trust to which no GST exemption is allocated unless to do so could result in an increase in the amount subject to the GST of a share trust to which a GST exemption is allocated.\n\n(Acts 1988, No. 88-340, p. 516, §6.)",
