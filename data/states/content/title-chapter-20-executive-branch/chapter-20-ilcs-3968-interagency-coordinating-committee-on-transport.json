      "text": "The General Assembly finds that\nsafe, reliable, and convenient transportation to and from (i) work and\nrelated destinations such as child care and education, (ii) medical\nappointments and related destinations such as a pharmacy, and (iii)\nancillary services necessary to the health, well-being, and\nindependence of the family such as grocery shopping, adult day services,\nand pharmacy related services are extremely\nimportant in the ability to\nfind and retain employment and insure the continued independence and\nwell-being of all citizens of Illinois, particularly in the lower\nincome sectors of the economy. For many people, these transportation\nneeds are not met by existing mass transit. In a national survey by\nthe University of Illinois at Chicago of over 500 riders of 23\nfederally funded community transportation projects under the Job Access\nand Reverse Commute (JARC) program across the nation, 68% of riders\nindicated that they would not be able to reach their employment without\nthis service. Furthermore, the national evaluation of the JARC program\nby the General Accounting Office illustrates that 65% of all projects\nhave extended existing fixed routes by schedule or location as well as\ncreated connections to existing services. This creates a need for\ninnovative transportation to work strategies that fit within local\ncircumstances in Illinois. Many localities around Illinois do not\nhave the resources or the expertise to develop and support innovative\ntransportation options. Localities need access to technical\nassistance both in designing programs and in accessing various sources\nof State and federal funds. Illinois also leaves substantial federal\ntransportation funds unclaimed because of the failure to put forward\nprojects to use the funds. Thus, Illinois would benefit from an\nInteragency Coordinating Committee to set priorities for improving\naccess to transportation for the transportation disadvantaged. The\nGeneral Accounting Office has found in its evaluation that interagency\ncollaboration has informed transit agencies of how to better serve low-income\ncommunities by knowing where jobs are located and a system of\nsupports are found. Illinois would also benefit from a unified State\nprocess to apply for federal transportation assistance for innovative\ntransportation to work projects and strategies and for identifying the\nmatching funds necessary to access that federal assistance. The\npurpose of this Act is to establish the Interagency Coordinating\nCommittee on Transportation.",
