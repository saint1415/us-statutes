Renewable\nfuels\nproduced from Illinois agricultural products hold great potential for growing\nthe State's\neconomy, reducing our dependence on foreign oil supplies, and improving the\nenvironment by reducing harmful emissions from vehicles. Illinois is the\nnation's leading\nproducer of ethanol, a clean, renewable fuel with significant environmental\nbenefits. The\nGeneral Assembly finds that reliable supplies of renewable fuels will be\nintegral to\nthe long term\nenergy security of the United States.\nThe General Assembly declares that it is the public policy of the\nState of\nIllinois to promote and encourage the production and use of renewable fuels as\na means\nnot only to improve air quality in the State and the nation, but also to grow\nthe\nagricultural sector of the Illinois economy. To achieve these public\npolicy\nobjectives, the General Assembly hereby authorizes the creation and\nimplementation of\nthe Illinois Renewable Fuels Development Program within the Agency.",
