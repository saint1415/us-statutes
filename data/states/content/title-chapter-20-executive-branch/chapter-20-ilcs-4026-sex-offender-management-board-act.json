This program will standardize the evaluation, treatment, and management of sex offenders at each stage of the\ncriminal or juvenile justice systems or mental health systems so\nthat\nthose offenders will curtail\nrecidivistic behavior and the protection of victims and potential victims will\nbe enhanced. The General Assembly recognizes that some sex offenders\ncannot or will not respond to counseling and that, in creating the program\ndescribed in this Act, the General Assembly does not intend to imply that\nall sex offenders can be successful in treatment.",
