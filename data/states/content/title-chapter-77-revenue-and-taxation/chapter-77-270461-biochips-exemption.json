      "text": "Biochips; exemption.(1) Sales and use taxes shall not be imposed on the gross receipts from the sale, lease, or rental of and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of biochips used for the purposes of conducting genotyping or the analysis of gene expression, protein expression, genomic sequencing, or protein profiling of plants, animals, or nonhuman laboratory research model organisms.(2) For purposes of this section, a biochip is a solid substrate upon or into which is incorporated specific genetic or protein information or chemicals that are queried through one or more chemical interactions allowing (a) an isolation of one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms which constitute an animal or plant genotype, (b) an expression profile which measures activity of genes or the presence of proteins, or (c) a detailed genomic sequence or protein profile. The specific genetic or protein information or chemicals incorporated upon or into the biochip are consumed in the process of conducting the analysis.SourceLaws 2012, LB830, § 3.",
