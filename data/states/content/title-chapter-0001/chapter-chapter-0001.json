      "text": "(1)It is the intent of the Legislature to adopt the working definition developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) of the term “antisemitism” to assist in the monitoring and reporting of antisemitic hate crimes and discrimination and to make residents aware of and to combat such incidents in this state.(2)As adopted by the IHRA on May 26, 2016, and as used in these statutes, the term “antisemitism” means a certain perception of Jewish individuals which may be expressed as hatred toward such individuals. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish and non-Jewish individuals and their property and toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.(3)Contemporary examples of antisemitism include, but are not limited to, all of the following:(a)Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jewish individuals.(b)Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jewish individuals as such or the power of Jewish people as a collective, such as the myth of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy or of Jewish individuals controlling the media, economy, government, or other societal institutions.(c)Accusing Jewish people as a collective of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group or for acts committed by non-Jewish individuals.(d)Denying the fact, scope, and mechanisms, such as gas chambers, or the intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of Nazi Germany and its supporters and accomplices during the Holocaust.(e)Accusing Jewish people as a collective, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.(f)Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jewish individuals worldwide, than to the interests of their respective nations.(g)Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination, such as claiming that the existence of the State of Israel is a racist endeavor.(h)Applying double standards by requiring of the Jewish State of Israel a standard of behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.(i)Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism, such as blood libel, to characterize Israel or Israelis.(j)Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.(k)Holding Jewish individuals collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.(4)The term “antisemitism” does not include criticism of Israel that is similar to criticism of any other country.(5)This section may not be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or to conflict with federal or state antidiscrimination laws.History.—s. 1, ch. 2024-262.",
