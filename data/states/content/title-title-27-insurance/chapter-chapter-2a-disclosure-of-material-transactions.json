No acquisitions or dispositions of assets need be reported, pursuant to Section 27-2A-2, if the acquisitions or dispositions are not material. For purposes of this section, a material acquisition (or the aggregate of any series of related acquisitions during any 30-day period) or disposition (or the aggregate of any series of related dispositions during any 30-day period) is one that is nonrecurring and not in the ordinary course of business and involves more than five percent of the reporting insurer’s total admitted assets as reported in its most recent statutory statement filed with the insurance department of the insurer’s state of domicile.\n\n(1) Asset acquisitions subject to this chapter include every purchase, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, succession, or other acquisition, other than the construction or development of real property, by or for the reporting insurer or the acquisition of materials for that purpose.\n\n(2) Asset dispositions subject to this chapter include every sale, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, mortgage, hypothecation, assignment, whether for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, abandonment, destruction, or other disposition.\n\n(c) Information to be reported.\n\n(1) The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material acquisition or disposition of assets:\n\na.

An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement and the net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent of the insurer’s capital and surplus.\n\n(Acts 1996, No. 96-784, p. 1426, §4.)",
