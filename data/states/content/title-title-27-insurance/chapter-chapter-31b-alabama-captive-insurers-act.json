The alien insurer shall be treated as a foreign insurer under Sections 27-27-45 and 27-27-46 and other jurisdictions shall be the equivalent of a state for purposes of Sections 27-27-45 and 27-27-46.\n\n(e) A conversion or merger under this section shall have all of the effects set forth in Section 10-2B-11.06 to the extent these effects are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(Act 2006-509, p. 1153, §1.)",
