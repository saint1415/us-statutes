No such agreement shall become effective unless filed with the commissioner and approved by him in writing after a hearing thereon.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall approve such agreement within a reasonable time after filing if he finds it to be fair and equitable to each domestic insurer involved, and that such reinsurance if effectuated would not substantially reduce the protection or service to its policyholders. If the commissioner does not so approve, he shall so notify each insurer involved in writing, specifying his reasons therefor.\n\n(c) The plan and agreement for such reinsurance must be approved by vote of not less than two-thirds of each domestic mutual insurer’s members voting thereon at meetings of members called for the purpose, pursuant to such reasonable notice and procedure as the commissioner may approve. If a life insurer, right to vote may be limited to members whose policies are other than term or group policies and have been in effect for more than one year.\n\n(d) If for reinsurance of a mutual insurer in a stock insurer, the agreement must provide for payment in cash to each member of the insurer entitled thereto, as upon conversion of such insurer pursuant to Section 27-27-44, of his equity in the business reinsured as determined under a fair formula approved by the commissioner, which equity shall be based upon such member’s equity in the reserves, assets, whether or not “admitted” assets, and surplus, if any, of the mutual insurer to be taken over by the stock insurer.\n\n(Acts 1919, No. 443, p. 678; Acts 1971, No. 407, p. 707, §544.)",

The insurer may, and if a life insurer shall, make a reasonable classification of its policies so held by such members and a formula based upon such classification for determining the equitable distributive share of each such member.
