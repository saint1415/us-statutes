For the purpose of this chapter, a health benefit plan located or domiciled outside of the State of Alabama is deemed to be subject to the provisions of this chapter if it receives, processes, adjudicates, pays, or denies claims for health care services submitted by or on behalf of patients, insureds, or beneficiaries who reside in the State of Alabama or who receive health care services in the State of Alabama. The term includes, but is not limited to, entities created pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 4 of Title 10.\n\n(Acts 1997, No. 97-721, p. 1492, §1.)",
