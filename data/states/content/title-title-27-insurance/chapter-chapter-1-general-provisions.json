      "heading": "Insurance Coverage for Drugs to Treat Life-Threatening Illnesses.",
      "text": "Section 27-1-10.1\n\nInsurance Coverage for Drugs to Treat Life-Threatening Illnesses.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:\n\n(1) The citizens of this state rely upon health insurance to cover the cost of obtaining health care and it is essential that the citizens’ expectation that their health care costs will be paid by their insurance policies is not disappointed and that they obtain the coverage necessary and appropriate for their care within the terms of their insurance policies.\n\n(2) Some insurers deny payment for drugs that have been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, hereafter referred to as FDA, when the drugs are used for indications other than those stated in the labelling approved by the FDA, off-label use, while other insurers with similar coverage terms do pay for off-label use.\n\n(3) Denial of payment for off-label use can interrupt or effectively deny access to necessary and appropriate treatment for a person being treated for a life-threatening illness.\n\n(4) Equity among employers who obtain insurance coverage for their employees and fair competition among insurance companies require that insurance companies assure citizens reimbursement for drugs in the same way and in the way citizens expect.\n\n(5) Off-label use of an FDA-approved drug is legal when prescribed in a medically appropriate manner and is often necessary to provide needed care. Approximately 50% of cancer drug treatment is for off-label indications. The FDA and the Federal Department of Health and Human Services recognize the wide variety of effective uses of FDA-approved drugs for off-label indications. Information on the appropriate off-label use of FDA-approved drugs is obtained from compendia published by the United States Pharmacopoeial Convention, the American Medical Association, and the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists. In addition, scientific studies of off-label use of drugs published in recognized peer-reviewed professional journals provide information on appropriate use of drugs for off-label indications. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 recognizes these three compendia and peer-reviewed literature as appropriate sources for reimbursement and requires Medicaid agencies to pay for off-label use of drugs prescribed for Medicaid patients if the use is stated in any of such sources. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 applies the same criteria and coverage to Medicare patients.\n\n(6) Use of FDA-approved drugs for off-label indications provides efficacious drugs at a lower cost. To require that all appropriate uses of a drug undergo approval by the FDA would substantially increase the cost of drugs and delay or even deny patients’ ability to obtain medically effective treatment. FDA approval for each use would require substantial expenditure and time to undergo the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval. This is particularly the case when a drug is off-patent and in generic production, and consequently is available at a lower price. Once a drug is in generic production by multiple manufacturers, it is not economically feasible for a manufacturer to incur the cost of FDA approval.\n\n(7) Reimbursement for off-label indications of FDA-approved drugs is necessary to conform to the way in which appropriate medical treatment is provided, to make needed drugs available to patients, and to contain health care costs.\n\n(b) The following words and phrases used in this section shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1) CONTRAINDICATION. The potential for, or the occurrence of, an undesirable alteration of the therapeutic effect of a given prescription because of the presence, in the patient for whom it is prescribed, of a disease condition or the potential for, or the occurrence of, a clinically significant adverse effect of the drug on the patient’s disease condition.\n\n(2) INDICATION. Any symptom, cause, or occurrence in a disease which points out its cause, diagnosis, course of treatment, or prognosis.\n\n(3) INSURANCE POLICY. An individual, group, blanket, or franchise insurance policy, insurance agreement, or group hospital service contract providing for hospital, medical, surgical, or pharmaceutical services.\n\n(4) MEDICAL LITERATURE. Published scientific studies published in any peer-reviewed national professional journal.\n\n(5) STANDARD REFERENCE COMPENDIA. Any of the following:\n\na. The United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information.\n\nb. The American Medical Association Drug Evaluations.\n\nc. The American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information.\n\n(c)(1) Title 27, or any other provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding, it is specifically provided that:\n\na. No insurance policy which provides coverage for drugs shall exclude coverage of a drug for a particular indication on the ground that the drug has not been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration for that indication, if the drug is recognized for treatment of that indication in one of the standard reference compendia, or in the medical literature, or by the Commissioner of Insurance.\n\nb. Coverage of a drug required by this section shall also include medically necessary services associated with the administration of the drug.\n\n(2) This section shall not be construed to alter existing law with regard to provisions limiting the coverage of drugs that have not been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(3) This section shall not be construed to require coverage for any drug when the Federal Food and Drug Administration has determined its use to be contraindicated.\n\n(4) This section shall not be construed to require coverage for experimental drugs not otherwise approved for any indication by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(5) The Commissioner of Insurance may direct any person who issues an insurance policy to make payments required by this section.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed, expressly or by implication, to create, impair, alter, limit, modify, enlarge, abrogate, or prohibit reimbursement for drugs used in the treatment of any other disease or condition.\n\n(Acts 1994, 1st Ex. Sess., No. 94-805, p. 121, §§1-3.)",

If the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan is denying or pending the claim, the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan shall, within 45 calendar days for a written claim and 30 calendar days for an electronic claim, notify the health care provider or certificate holder of the reason for denying or pending the claim and what, if any, additional information is required to process the claim. Any undisputed portion of the claim shall be paid in accordance with the foregoing schedule. If the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan fails to provide the notice to the health care provider of the reason for denying or pending the claim, then any such claim, if and when determined to be payable, shall accrue interest at the rate as provided herein, from the date such notice should have been given in accordance with this provision.

In no event shall an insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan require that the health care provider submit data elements in excess of those required on the standard electronic health insurance claim format designated by Section 27-1-16 as a condition to the acceptance and processing of an initial claim as a clean claim.\n\n(2) CLEAN WRITTEN CLAIM. A claim for payment of covered health care expenses that is submitted to an insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan on the claim form of the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan which contains substantially all of the required data elements necessary for accurate adjudication, without obtaining additional information from the provider of the service or from a third party. In no event shall an insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan require that the health care provider submit information or data elements in excess of those required on the standard health insurance claim form designated by Section 27-1-16 as a condition to the acceptance and processing of an initial claim as a clean claim.\n\n(3) COORDINATION OF BENEFITS.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract to the contrary, if an insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan retroactively denies reimbursement for services as a result of coordination of benefits with another insurer, the health care provider shall have an additional six months from the date that the health care provider received the notice specified herein to submit a claim for reimbursement for the service to the insurer, health service corporation, health benefit plan, medical assistance program, government health benefit program, or other entity responsible for payment for the services provided.\n\n(g) An insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan that retroactively denies, adjusts, or seeks recoupment or refund of a paid claim submitted by a health care provider shall give the health care provider notice specifying the reason for the action taken.

Nothing in this section shall prevent or preclude an insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan from recovering in the circuit or district courts from a subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary any amounts paid to a health care provider for benefits to which the subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary was not entitled under the terms and conditions of the contract of insurance or the coverage agreement if the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan is barred from seeking a retroactive denial, adjustment, or request for recoupment or refund from the health care provider under this section.\n\n(i) The commissioner may assess an administrative fine against any insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan or may suspend or revoke the license or certificate of authority of any insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan after determining that the insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan has violated the requirements of subsections (e), (f), and (g) or has established a pattern of overdue payments and that the contemplated enforcement action would not promote the deterioration of the financial condition of an at-risk insurer, health service corporation, or health benefit plan. Such fine shall be up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation of the requirement of subsections (e), (f), and (g) or for each day that the claim or claims remained unpaid, not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per violation.
