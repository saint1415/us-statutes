      "text": "Section 27-29-2\n\nSubsidiaries and Affiliates of Domestic Insurers.\n\n(a) Authorization. A domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries or affiliates of a domestic insurer.\n\n(b) Additional investment authority. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted under all other sections of this title, a domestic insurer may also:\n\n(1) Invest, in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of such insurer’s assets or 50 percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments, the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries and health maintenance organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included both of the following:\n\na. Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such subsidiary, whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities.\n\nb. All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.\n\n(2) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer provided that each such subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in subdivision (1) or in Sections 27-41-15 through 27-41-18 and 27-41-35. For the purpose of this subdivision, “the total investment of the insurer” shall include both of the following:\n\na. Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset.\n\nb. The insurer’s proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary’s investment by the percentage of the insurer’s ownership of such subsidiary.\n\n(3) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, provided that after such investment the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.\n\n(c) Exemption from investment restrictions. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection (b) shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this title applicable to such investments of insurers.\n\n(d) Qualification of investment; when determined. Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before such investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the date they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.\n\n(e) Cessation of control. If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after such investment shall have been made such investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this title, and the insurer has notified the commissioner.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1042, p. 1636, §3; Acts 1980, No. 80-199, p. 276; Acts 1981, No. 81-314, p. 446; Acts 1994, No. 94-634, p. 1178, §2; Act 2014-324, p. 1151, §1.)",

The commissioner shall determine those instances in which the party or parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer, will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the commissioner, in his or her discretion, determines that confidential treatment will interfere with enforcement of this section. If the statement referred to in subdivision (1) is otherwise filed, this subdivision shall not apply.\n\n(3) With respect to a transaction subject to this section, the acquiring person must also file a pre-acquisition notification with the commissioner, which shall contain the information set forth in subdivision (c)(1) of Section 27-29-3.1. A failure to file the notification may be subject to penalty specified in subdivision of (e)(3) of Section 27-29-3.1.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section:\n\na.

The amount of each class of any security referred to in subsection (a) which is beneficially owned or concerning which there is a right to acquire beneficial ownership by each acquiring party.\n\ng. A full description of any contracts, arrangements, or understandings with respect to any security referred to in subsection (a) in which any acquiring party is involved, including, but not limited to, transfer of any of the securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of loans, guarantees against loss or guarantees of profits, division of losses or profits, or the giving or withholding of proxies. Such description shall identify the persons with whom such contracts, arrangements, or understandings have been entered.\n\nh. A description of the purchase of any security referred to in subsection (a) during the 12 calendar months preceding the filing of the statement by any acquiring party, including the dates of purchase, names of the purchasers, and consideration paid, or agreed to be paid, therefor.\n\ni. A description of any recommendations to purchase any security referred to in subsection (a) made during the 12 calendar months preceding the filing of the statement by any acquiring party or by anyone based upon interviews or at the suggestion of such acquiring party.\n\nj. Copies of all tender offers for, requests or invitations for tenders of, exchange offers for and agreements to acquire or exchange any securities referred to in subsection (a) and, if distributed, of additional soliciting material relating thereto.\n\nk. The terms of any agreement, contract, or understanding made with or proposed to be made with any broker-dealer as to solicitation of securities referred to in subsection (a) for tender and the amount of any fees, commissions, or other compensation to be paid to broker-dealers with regard thereto.\n\nl. An agreement by the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) that it will provide the annual report, specified in subdivision (1) of subsection (l) of Section 27-29-4, for so long as control exists.\n\nm. An acknowledgement by the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) that the person and all subsidiaries within its control in the insurance holding company system will provide information to the commissioner upon request as necessary to evaluate enterprise risk to the insurer.\n\nn. Such additional information as the commissioner may, by rule or regulation, prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders of the insurer or in the public interest.\n\n(2) If the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) is a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group, the commissioner may require that the information called for by paragraphs a. through n. of subdivision (1) shall be given with respect to each partner of such partnership or limited partnership, each member of such syndicate or group, and each person who controls such partner or member. If any such partner, member, or person is a corporation or the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) is a corporation, the commissioner may require that the information called for by paragraphs a. through n. of subdivision (1) shall be given with respect to such corporation, each officer and director of such corporation, and each person who is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation. If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed with the commissioner and sent to such insurer pursuant to this section, an amendment setting forth such change, together with copies of all documents and other materials relevant to such change, shall be filed with the commissioner and sent to such insurer within two business days after the person learns of such change.\n\n(c) If any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition referred to in subsection (a) is proposed to be made by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, or in circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or under a state law requiring similar registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) may utilize such documents in furnishing the information called for by that statement.\n\n(d)(1) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) unless, after a public hearing thereon, he or she finds any of the following:\n\na. After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (a) would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line, or lines, of insurance for which it is presently licensed.\n\nb. The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or to create a monopoly therein. In applying the competitive standard in this paragraph:\n\n1. The informational requirements of subdivision (c)(1) of Section 27-29-3.1 and the standards of subdivision (d)(2) of Section 27-29-3.1 shall apply.\n\n2. The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by subdivision (d)(3) of Section 27-29-3.1 exist.\n\n3. The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time.\n\nc. The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders.\n\nd. The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, to sell its assets, or to consolidate or merge it with any person or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest.\n\ne. The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control.\n\nf. The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.\n\n(2) The public hearing referred to in subdivision (1) shall be held within 30 days after the statement required by subsection (a) is filed, and at least 20 days’ notice thereof shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement. Not less than seven days’ notice of such public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to such other persons as may be designated by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination within the 60-day period preceding the effective date of the proposed transaction. At such hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and, in connection therewith, shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the circuit courts of this state. All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.\n\n(3) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in subdivision (2) may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (a). The person shall file the statement referred to in subsection (a) with the NAIC within five days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (a). A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend the hearing in person or by telecommunication.\n\n(4) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subdivision (a)(1).\n\n(5) The commissioner may retain any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner’s staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control, the reasonable expenses of which shall be borne by the acquiring person.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to:\n\n(1) Any transaction which is subject to the provisions of Sections 27-27-45 and 27-27-46, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers.\n\n(2) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt therefrom as either of the following:\n\na. Not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer.\n\nb. As otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.\n\n(f) The following shall be violations of this section:\n\n(1) The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsections (a) or (b).\n\n(2) The effectuation, or any attempt to effectuate, an acquisition of control of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given his or her approval thereto.\n\n(g) The courts of this state are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each such person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by such a person of the commissioner to be his or her true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action or proceeding arising out of violations of this section. Copies of all such lawful process shall be served on the commissioner and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the commissioner to such person at his or her last known address.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1042, p. 1636, §4; Acts 1986, No. 86-464, p. 844, §1; Acts 1994, No. 94-634, p. 1178, §2; Act 2014-324, p. 1151, §1; Act 2022-151, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 27-29-3.1\n\nAcquisition Involving Change in Control of Insurer Authorized to Do Business in Alabama; Pre-acquisition Notification; Violation of Competitive Standards.\n\n(a) The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section only:\n\n(1) ACQUISITION. Any agreement or arrangement the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance, and mergers.\n\n(2) INVOLVED INSURER. Includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.\n\n(b)(1) Except as exempted in subdivision (2), this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.\n\n(2) This section shall not apply to the following:\n\na. A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes so long as the securities, by voting or otherwise, are not used to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under subsection (c) of Section 27-29-1, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer’s state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.\n\nb. The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition notification is filed with the commissioner in accordance with subdivision (1) of subsection (c) 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. However, such pre-acquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other paragraph of subdivision (2) of subsection (b).\n\nc. The acquisition of already affiliated persons.\n\nd.1. An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition, any of the follow occurs:\n\n(i) The combined market share of the involved insurers does not exceed five percent of the total market in any market.\n\n(ii) There is no increase in any market share.\n\n(iii) Both of the following do not occur in any market:\n\nA. The combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds 12 percent of the total market.\n\nB. The market share increases by more than two percent of the total market.\n\n2. For the purpose of this paragraph, a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.\n\ne. An acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business.\n\nf. An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition, there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition, the public benefits of improving the insurer’s condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition, and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.\n\n(c) An acquisition covered by subsection (d) may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection (e) unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification. The commissioner shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection in the same manner as provided in Section 27-29-7.\n\n(1) The pre-acquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the commissioner relating to those markets which, under paragraph d. of subdivision (2) of subsection (b), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from this section. The commissioner may require such additional material and information as deemed necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (d). The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.\n\n(2) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner, on a one-time basis, may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.\n\n(d)(1) The commissioner may enter an order under subdivision (1) of subsection (e) with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (c).\n\n(2) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of subdivision (1), the commissioner shall consider the following:\n\na.1. Any acquisition covered under subsection (b) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market may be considered prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards.\n\n(i) If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:Insurer AInsurer B4%4% or more10%2% or more15%1% or more\n\n(ii) Or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:Insurer AInsurer B5%5% or more10%4% or more15%3% or more19%1% or more\n\n2. A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is 75 percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table may be considered prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subdivision (1). For the purpose of this paragraph, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be Insurer A.\n\nb. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five to 10 years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (b) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market may be considered prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subdivision (1) if all of the following occur:\n\n1. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market.\n\n2. One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share.\n\n3. Another involved insurer’s market is two percent or more.\n\nc. For the purposes of this subdivision:\n\n1. “Insurer” includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control.\n\n2. “Market” means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state.\n\n3. The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the commissioner.\n\nd. Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under paragraphs a. and b., the commissioner may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under paragraphs a. and b., a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following: Market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(3) An order may not be entered under subdivision (1) of subsection (e) in either of the following instances:\n\na. The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.\n\nb. The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.\n\n(e)(1)a. If an acquisition which takes place after January 1, 2016, violates the standards of this section, the commissioner may enter an order doing either of the following:\n\n1. Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation.\n\n2. Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.\n\nb. The order shall not be entered unless all of the following occur:\n\n1. There is a hearing conducted within six years of the acquisition.\n\n2. Notice of the hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing.\n\n3. The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the date of the filing of the pre-acquisition notification with the commissioner.\n\nc. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nd. An order pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.\n\n(2) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under subdivision (1) while the order is in effect, after notice and hearing and upon order of the commissioner, is subject to one or more of the following:\n\na. A monetary penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for every day of violation.\n\nb. Suspension or revocation of the person’s license.\n\n(3) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any filing requirement, is subject to a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).\n\n(f) Subsections (b) and (c) of Section 27-29-9 and Section 27-29-11 do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (b).\n\n(Act 2014-324, p. 1151, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 27-29-4\n\nRegistration of Insurers.\n\n(a)(1) Every insurer which is authorized to do business in this state and which is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the commissioner, except a foreign insurer subject to registration requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile which are substantially similar to those contained in this section and both of the following:\n\na. Subdivision (a)(1), and subsections (b) and (d) of Section 27-29-5.\n\nb. Either subdivision (a)(2) of Section 27-29-5 or a provision such as the following: Each registered insurer shall keep current the information required to be disclosed in its registration statement by reporting all material changes or additions within 15 days after the end of the month in which it learns of each change or addition.\n\n(2) Any insurer which is subject to registration under this section shall register within 15 days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by June 1 of each year for the previous calendar year, unless the commissioner for good cause shown extends the time for registration and, then, within such extended time. The commissioner may require any authorized insurer that is a member of an insurance holding company system which is not subject to registration under this section to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the summary specified in subsection (c), or other information filed by such insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary jurisdiction.\n\n(b) Every insurer subject to registration shall file a registration statement on a form prescribed by the commissioner by rule which shall contain the following current information:\n\n(1) The capital structure, general financial condition, ownership, and management of the insurer and any person controlling the insurer.\n\n(2) The identity of every member of the insurance holding company system.\n\n(3) The following agreements in force, and transactions currently outstanding or which have occurred during the last calendar year between such insurer and its affiliates:\n\na. Loans, other investments or purchases, sales, or exchanges of securities of the affiliates by the insurer or of the insurer by its affiliates.\n\nb. Purchases, sales, or exchanges of assets.\n\nc. Transactions not in the ordinary course of business.\n\nd. Guarantees or undertakings for the benefit of an affiliate which result in an actual contingent exposure of the insurer’s assets to liability, other than insurance contracts entered into in the ordinary course of the insurer’s business.\n\ne. All management agreements and service contracts and all cost-sharing arrangements.\n\nf. Reinsurance agreements.\n\ng. Dividends and other distributions to shareholders.\n\nh. Consolidated tax allocation agreements.\n\n(4) Any pledge of the insurer’s stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system.\n\n(5) If requested by the commissioner, financial statements of or within an insurance holding company system, including all affiliates. Financial statements may include, but are not limited to, annual audited financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this subdivision may satisfy the request by providing the commissioner with the most recently filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. Financial statements of insurer’s affiliates required to be filed with the commissioner may be filed by the insurer in the accounting standard utilized by the affiliate in its usual course of business at the time of the filing.\n\n(6) Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included, from time to time, in any registration forms adopted or approved by the commissioner.\n\n(7) Statements that the insurer’s board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board oversees corporate governance and internal controls and that the insurer’s officers or senior management have approved, implemented, and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control procedures.\n\n(8) Any other information required by the commissioner by rule.\n\n(c) All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.\n\n(d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to subsection (b) if such information is not material for the purposes of this section. Unless the commissioner by rule, regulation, or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, or extensions of credit or investments involving one-half of one percent or less of an insurer’s admitted assets as of December 31, next preceding, shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section. The definition of materiality provided in this subsection shall not apply for purposes of the Group Capital Calculation or the Liquidity Stress Test Framework.\n\n(e) Subject to subsection (b) of Section 27-29-5, each registered insurer shall so report all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within 15 business days following the declaration thereof.\n\n(f) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where the information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall terminate the registration of any insurer which demonstrated that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.\n\n(h) The commissioner may require or allow two or more affiliated insurers subject to registration under this section to file a consolidated registration statement.\n\n(i) The commissioner may allow an insurer that is authorized to do business in this state and which is part of an insurance holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer that is required to register under subsection (a) and to file all information and material required to be filed under this section.\n\n(j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, information, or transaction if, and to the extent that, the commissioner by rule, regulation, or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section.\n\n(k) Any person may file with the commissioner a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or a disclaimer may be filed by the insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer, as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. A disclaimer of affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the commissioner, within 30 days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed. In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.\n\n(1) Enterprise Risk Filings.\n\n(l) Enterprise Risk Report. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person’s knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\n(2)a. Group Capital Calculation. Except as provided in this subdivision, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall concurrently file with the registration an annual group capital calculation as directed by the lead state commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC Group Capital Calculation Instructions, which may permit the lead state commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the commissioner in accordance with the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC. The following insurance holding company systems described are exempt from filing the group capital calculation:\n\n1. An insurance holding company system that has only one insurer within its holding company structure, that only writes business and is only licensed in its domestic state, and assumes no business from any other insurer.\n\n2. An insurance holding company system that is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by the United States Federal Reserve Board. The lead state commissioner shall request the calculation from the Federal Reserve Board under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If the Federal Reserve Board cannot share the calculation with the lead state commissioner, the insurance holding company system is not exempt from the group capital calculation filing.\n\n3. An insurance holding company system whose non-U.S. group-wide supervisor is located within a reciprocal jurisdiction as described in Section 27-5B-8.1, which recognizes the U.S. state regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital.\n\n4. An insurance holding company system meeting both of the following:\n\n(i) That provides information to the lead state which meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide supervisor, who has determined such information is satisfactory to allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC Financial Analysis Handbook.\n\n(ii) Whose non-U.S. group-wide supervisor that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the commissioner in regulation, the group capital calculation as the world-wide group capital assessment for U.S. insurance groups who operate in that jurisdiction.\n\nb. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs a.3. and a.4., a lead state commissioner shall require the group capital calculation for U.S. operations of any non-U.S. based insurance holding company system when, after any necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, the lead state commissioner deems it appropriate for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance marketplace.\n\nc. Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital calculation stated in subparagraphs a.1. through a.4., the lead state commissioner may exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria as specified by the commissioner in regulation.\n\nd. If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date, unless given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.\n\n(3) Liquidity Stress Test.\n\na. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration and also scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework shall file the results of a specific year’s liquidity stress test. The filing shall be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC.\n\nb. The NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework includes scope criteria applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at least annually by the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor. Any change to the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework, or to the data year for which the scope criteria are to be measured, shall be effective on January 1 of the year following the calendar year when such changes are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should not be scoped into the framework for that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped into the framework for that data year.\n\nc. Regulators should avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework on a frequent basis. The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, shall assess this concern as part of the determination for an insurer.\n\nd. The performance of, and filing of the results from, a specific year’s liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC Liquidity Stress Test Framework’s instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead state insurance commissioner determinations, in conjunction with the Financial Stability Task Force or its successor, provided within the Framework.\n\n(m) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for filing shall be a violation of this section.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1042, p. 1636, §5; Acts 1994, No. 94-634, p. 1178, §2; Act 2014-324, p. 1151, §1; Act 2017-228, §1; Act 2022-151, §2.)",

The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported, within 30 days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the commissioner for determination of the type of filing required, if any.\n\na. Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, or investments provided the transactions are equal to or exceed the following:\n\n1. With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer’s admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding.\n\n2.

Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit provided the transactions are equal to or exceed the following:\n\n1. With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer’s admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding.\n\n2.

All reinsurance pooling agreements.\n\n2. Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders, as of the 31st day of December next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer.\n\nd. All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees and all cost-sharing arrangements.\n\ne. Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer; provided, however, that a guarantee which is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph unless it exceeds the lesser of one-half of one percent of the insurer’s admitted assets or 10 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding. Further, all guarantees which are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this paragraph.\n\nf. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount which, together with its present holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one-half percent of the insurer’s surplus to policyholders. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in subsidiaries acquired pursuant to Section 27-29-2, or authorized under any other section of this title, or in non-subsidiary insurance affiliates that are subject to this chapter, are exempt from this requirement.\n\ng. Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer’s policyholders.\n\n(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\n(c) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner determines that such separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his or her authority under Section 27-29-10.\n\n(d) The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (b), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10 percent of the corporation’s voting securities.\n\n(f) For purposes of this chapter in determining whether an insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:\n\n(1) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria.\n\n(2) The extent to which the insurer’s business is diversified among the several lines of insurance.\n\n(3) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business.\n\n(4) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer’s insured risks.\n\n(5) The nature and extent of the insurer’s reinsurance program.\n\n(6) The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer’s investment portfolio.\n\n(7) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer’s investment portfolio.\n\n(8) The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers.\n\n(9) The adequacy of the insurer’s reserves.\n\n(10) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever, in the judgment of the commissioner, the investment so warrants.\n\n(g)(1)a. A domestic insurer shall not pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until 30 days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not disapproved such payment within the period, or until the time the commissioner has approved the payment within the 30-day period.\n\nb. For purposes of this section, an “extraordinary dividend or distribution” includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of the following:\n\n1. Ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding.\n\n2. The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains or the pro rata distribution of any class of the insurer’s own securities, for the 12-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding.\n\n(2) A domestic insurer subject to registration under Section 27-29-4 shall report to the commissioner all dividends to shareholders within five business days following the declaration of the dividends and not less than 10 days prior to the payment of the dividends. This report shall also include a schedule setting forth all dividends or other distributions made within the previous 12 months.\n\n(3) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carryforward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner’s approval of the dividend or distribution. The declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution or the commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period as provided in subdivision (1).\n\n(5) The commissioner shall assess such reasonable charges as he or she deems necessary for the review conducted pursuant to this section. All funds received shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Special Examination Revolving Fund, from which the expenses incurred shall be paid.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1042, p. 1636, §6; Acts 1994, No. 94-634, p. 1178, §2; Act 2014-324, p. 1151, §1.)",

Any such determination shall be accompanied by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1042, p. 1636, §13.)",
