The amount of coverage under the long-term care insurance contract shall be equal to or greater than Medicaid coverage for a period of at least three years.\n\n(c) An insurance contract shall not fail to be treated as a long-term care contract by reason of the payments being made on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to the expenses incurred during the period to which the payments relate.\n\n(d) A long-term care insurance contract may cover Medicare reimbursable expenses where Medicare is a secondary payor.\n\n(e) In the case of long-term care insurance coverage provided by a rider on a life insurance contract, this chapter shall apply as if the portion of the contract providing long-term care coverage was a separate contract.\n\n(f) The deduction is available to the person or entity who pays the premiums.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-738, p. 772, §2.)",
