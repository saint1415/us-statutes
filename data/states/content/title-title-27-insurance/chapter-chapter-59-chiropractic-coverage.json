Any individual or group plan, employee welfare benefit plan, policy, or contract for health care services issued, delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this state by a health care insurer, health maintenance organization, accident and sickness insurer, fraternal benefit society, nonprofit hospital service corporation, nonprofit medical service corporation, health care service plan, or any other person, firm, corporation, joint venture, or other similar business entity that pays for insureds or beneficiaries in this state. The term includes, but is not limited to, entities created pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 20 of Title 10A. A health benefit plan located or domiciled outside of the State of Alabama is deemed to be subject to this chapter if it receives, processes, adjudicates, pays, or denies claims for health care services submitted by or on behalf of patients, insureds, or beneficiaries who reside in Alabama. Provided, however, the term shall not include accident-only, specified disease, hospital indemnity, Medicare supplement, long-term care, disability income, or other limited benefit health insurance policies.\n\n(2) CHIROPRACTIC.
