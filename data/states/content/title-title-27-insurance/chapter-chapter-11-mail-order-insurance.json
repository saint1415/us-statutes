It is the purpose of this unauthorized insurers law to make it unlawful for insurers that are not licensed to transact the business of insurance in this state and to subject said insurers to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state in actions or proceedings brought by the commissioner in transactions involving unauthorized insurers or for the protection of insureds and claimants residing in this state and for the protection of the public. This chapter constitutes and may be referred to as the “Unauthorized Insurers Law.”\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 407, p. 707, §220.)",

Service of such process shall be made by serving three copies of the process on the said Secretary of State, and such service shall be sufficient service upon the said insurer, provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the process are forthwith sent by registered or certified mail by the Secretary of State to the defendant at its last known address, which shall be stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff or complainant, marked “deliver to addressee only” and “return receipt requested,” and provided, further, that such return receipt shall be received by the Secretary of State purporting to have been signed by said insurer, or the Secretary of State shall be advised by the postal authority that delivery of said registered or certified mail was refused by said insurer; and the date on which the Secretary of State receives said return receipt, or advice by the postal authority that delivery of said registered or certified mail was refused shall be treated and considered as the date of service of process on said insurer. The Secretary of State shall make an affidavit as to the service of said process on him, and as to his mailing a copy of the same and notice of such service to the insurer and as to the receipt of said return receipt, or advice of the refusal of said registered or certified mail, and the respective dates thereof, and shall attach said affidavit, return receipt or advice from the postal authority to a copy of the process and shall return the same to the clerk or register who issued the same, and all of the same shall be filed in the action by the clerk or register.
