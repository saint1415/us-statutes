      "text": "Section 27-49-2\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds that the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology is devoted to primary and preventive health care of women throughout their lifetime. Significant numbers of women view their obstetrician and gynecologist as their primary or only physician. For many women, an obstetrician or gynecologist is often the only physician they see regularly during their reproductive years. A general medical examination was the second most frequently cited purpose for patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists in 1989 and 1990. Obstetricians and gynecologists refer their patients less frequently than other primary care physicians, thus avoiding costly and time consuming referrals to specialists. Accordingly, it is the intent of the Legislature that women enrolled or covered by health benefit plans have direct access to the services of a participating obstetrician or a participating gynecologist.\n\n(Acts 1996, No. 96-671, p. 1135, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 27-49-4\n\nObstetricians and Gynecologists as Primary Care Physicians; Direct Access to Obstetrician and Gynecologist Not Used as Primary Care Physicians.\n\n(a) Each health benefit plan which is issued, delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this state on or after October 1, 1996, shall allow obstetricians and gynecologists as primary care physicians. This subsection shall not be construed to require an individual obstetrician or gynecologist to accept primary care physician status if the obstetrician or gynecologist does not wish to be designated as a primary care physician, nor to interfere with the credentialing and other selection criteria usually applied by a health benefit plan with respect to other physicians within its network.\n\n(b) For women not using an obstetrician or gynecologist as their primary care physician, no health benefit plan which is issued, delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this state on or after October 1, 1996, shall require as a condition to the coverage of the services of a participating obstetrician or a participating gynecologist that an enrollee, subscriber, or insured first obtain a referral from another primary care physician, it being the intent of this subsection that a woman shall at all times have direct access to the services of a participating obstetrician or a participating gynecologist, or both, under any health benefit plan; provided, however, that the service covered by this subsection shall be limited to those services defined by the published recommendations of the Accreditation Council For Graduate Medical Education for training as an obstetrician or gynecologist, including, but not limited to, diagnosis, treatment, and referral.\n\n(Acts 1996, No. 96-671, p. 1135, §4.)",
