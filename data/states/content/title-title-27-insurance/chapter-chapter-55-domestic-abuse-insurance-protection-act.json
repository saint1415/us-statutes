      "heading": "Prohibited Practices; Disclosure of Information.",
      "text": "Section 27-55-3\n\nProhibited Practices; Disclosure of Information.\n\n(a) No insurer may:\n\n(1) Deny, refuse to issue, renew, or reissue, cancel, or otherwise terminate, restrict, or exclude coverage on an insurance policy or health benefit plan on the basis of an applicant’s or insured’s abuse status, or on the basis of any association, relationship, or assistance to a subject of abuse.\n\n(2) Exclude or limit coverage for a loss, deny benefits, or deny a claim on the basis of the insured’s abuse status, or on the basis of any association, relationship, or assistance to a subject of abuse, except as otherwise permitted or required by the laws of this state relating to acts of abuse committed by a life insurance beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, a liability insurer may include policy provisions providing that a payment required by this subsection may be denied or, if paid, recovered by the insurer from the insured, if the claim arose out of an act of abuse by the insured.\n\n(3) Add a premium differential to an insurance policy or health benefit plan on the basis of an applicant’s or insured’s abuse status, or on the basis of any association, relationship, or assistance to a subject of abuse.\n\n(4) Terminate health coverage for a subject of abuse, where the subject of abuse does not qualify for coverage under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), because coverage originally was issued in the name of the abuser and the abuser has divorced, separated from, or lost custody of the subject of abuse or the abuser’s coverage has terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the insurer from requiring the subject of abuse to pay the full premium for the subject’s coverage or requiring the subject of abuse to reside or work within its service area if the requirements are applied to all insureds of the insurer or health carrier. The insurer may terminate coverage after the continuation coverage required by this subdivision has been in force for 18 months. The continuation coverage required by this subdivision shall be satisfied by a COBRA coverage provided to a subject of abuse and is not intended to be in addition to any coverage provided under COBRA.\n\n(b) When the insurer has information in its possession that indicates that the applicant, insured, or claimant is a subject of abuse, it is a violation of this section for an insurer to disclose confidential abuse information for any purpose or to any person, except:\n\n(1) To a subject of abuse or a person specifically designated in writing by a subject of abuse.\n\n(2) To a health care provider for the direct provision of health care services.\n\n(3) To a licensed physician identified and designated by the subject of abuse.\n\n(4) When ordered by the commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise required by law.\n\n(5) When necessary for a valid business purpose to transfer information that includes confidential abuse information. Confidential abuse information may be disclosed only to the following persons:\n\na. A reinsurer that seeks to indemnify or indemnifies all or part of a policy covering a subject of abuse and that cannot underwrite or satisfy its obligations under the reinsurance agreement without disclosure.\n\nb. A party to a proposed or consummated sale, transfer, merger, or consolidation of all or part of the business of the insurer.\n\nc. Medical or claims personnel contracting with the insurer, including parent or affiliate companies of the insurer that have service agreements with the insurer, only when necessary to process an application or perform the insurer’s duties under the policy or to protect the safety or privacy of a subject of abuse.\n\nd. With respect to address and telephone number, an entity with whom the insurer transacts business when the business cannot be transacted without the address and telephone number.\n\n(6) To an attorney who needs the information to represent the insurer effectively, if the insurer notifies the attorney of its obligations under this chapter and requests that the attorney exercise due diligence to protect the confidential abuse information consistent with the attorney’s obligation to represent the insurer.\n\n(7) To the policy owner or assignee, in the course of delivery of the policy, if the policy contains information about the abuse status.\n\n(8) To any other entity deemed appropriate by the commissioner.\n\n(c) No insurer may require an applicant to disclose information relating to acts of abuse or an applicant’s abuse status for use or consideration as part of the initial application for coverage in the health or medical underwriting process. However, this section does not prohibit an insurer from asking an applicant or insured about a medical condition or a claim or from using information thereby obtained to underwrite or to evaluate and carry out its rights and duties under the policy, even if the information is related to a medical condition or claim that the insurer knows or has reason to know is abuse-related, to the extent otherwise permitted under this chapter and other applicable law.\n\n(d) This section does not preclude a subject of abuse from obtaining his or her own medical records from an insurer.\n\n(e) A subject of abuse must provide evidence of abuse to an insurer to come within the protection afforded by this chapter or to facilitate treatment of an abuse-related condition, or both, or demonstrate that a condition is abuse related. A person must provide evidence of abuse to an insurer to demonstrate that a property and casualty claim is abuse related. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize an insurer to disregard that information or the confidentiality of the source of information or evidence.\n\n(f) This section does not prohibit a property or casualty insurer from denying a property claim when the damage or loss is the result of intentional conduct by a named insured who commits an act of abuse, except that the property and casualty insurer shall make payment on such a claim to an innocent co-insured subject of abuse to the extent of the innocent co-insured’s interest in the property and within the limits of coverage when the damage or loss was proximately related to and in furtherance of abuse. To recover for a claim under this subsection, the innocent co-insured is required to do one of the following: (1) File a complaint under the “Protection from Abuse Act,” Section 30-5-1 et seq., against the abuser for the act causing this loss, and not voluntarily dismiss the complaint, or (2) seek a warrant for the abuser’s arrest for the act causing this loss and cooperate in the prosecution of the abuser. A property and casualty insurer paying a claim shall be subrogated to the rights of the innocent co-insured subject of abuse to recover for any damages paid by the insurance.\n\nNothing in this chapter shall prohibit a property or casualty insurer from nonrenewing coverage for the subject of abuse if, after a claim, the subject of abuse remains married to or continues to reside in the same household with the abuser.\n\n(g) This section does not prohibit a life insurer from declining to issue a life insurance policy if the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is or would be designated as a beneficiary of the policy, and if:\n\n(1) The applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks an insurable interest in the prospective insured.\n\n(2) The applicant or prospective owner of the policy is known on the basis of medical, police, or court records to have committed an act of abuse against the prospective insured.\n\n(3) The insured or prospective insured is a subject of abuse, and that person, or a person who has assumed the care of that person, if a minor or incapacitated, has objected to the issuance of the policy on the ground that the policy would be issued to or for the direct or indirect benefit of the abuser.\n\n(h) An insurer shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for the death of or injury to an insured resulting from any action taken in a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of this chapter. This subsection does not prevent an action by the commissioner to investigate or enforce a violation of this chapter.\n\n(Act 2000-595, p. 1185, §3.)",

If the commissioner finds from the investigation that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the commissioner shall promptly begin proceedings to address the violation through means such as imposition of injunctive relief, requiring restitution, and, in cases of repeated violation after previous findings or warnings of violations from the commissioner, suspension or revocation of certificates of authority or licenses. The powers and duties set forth in this chapter shall be in addition to all other authority of the commissioner.\n\n(c) An insurer which is found by the commissioner to have violated this chapter may be ordered by the commissioner to do any of the following:\n\n(1) Pay a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each act or violation.
