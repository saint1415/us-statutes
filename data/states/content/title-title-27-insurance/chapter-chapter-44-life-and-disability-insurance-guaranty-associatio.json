      "text": "Section 27-44-3\n\nScope of Chapter.\n\n(a) This chapter shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection (b) as follows:\n\n(1) To persons who, regardless of where they reside (except for non-resident certificate holders under group policies or contracts), are the beneficiaries, assignees, or payees of the persons covered under subdivision (2).\n\n(2) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the policies or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, and in each case who are either of the following:\n\na. Residents\n\nb. Not residents, but only under all of the following conditions:\n\n1. The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this state.\n\n2. The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by this chapter.\n\n3. The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact the insurer was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state’s guaranty association law.\n\n(3) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (b), subdivision (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply, and this chapter, except as provided in subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subsection, shall provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity (or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased), if the payee is either of the following:\n\na. A resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides.\n\nb. Not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions:\n\n1. The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is either of the following:\n\n(i) A resident.\n\n(ii) Not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions:\n\n(I) The insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state.\n\n(II) The state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association created by this chapter.\n\n2. Neither the payee (or beneficiary) nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.\n\n(4) The chapter shall not provide coverage to a person who is a payee (or beneficiary) of a contract owner resident of this state, if the payee (or beneficiary) is afforded any coverage by the association of another state.\n\n(5) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person shall not be provided coverage under this chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this subdivision in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association.\n\n(b)(1) This chapter shall provide coverage to the persons specified in subsection (a) for direct, non-group life, disability, or annuity policies or contracts, and for certificates under direct group policies and contracts, and for supplemental contracts to any of these, in each case issued by member insurers, except as limited by this chapter. Annuity contracts and certificates under group annuity contracts include allocated funding agreements, structured settlement annuities, and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts.\n\n(2) This chapter shall not provide coverage for any of the following:\n\na. A portion of a policy or contract not guaranteed by the insurer, or under which the risk is borne by the policy or contract owner.\n\nb. A policy or contract of reinsurance, unless assumption certificates have been issued pursuant to the reinsurance policy or contract.\n\nc. A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the rate of interest on which it is based, or the interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value:\n\n1. Averaged over the period of four years prior to the date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this chapter, whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting two percentage points from Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average averaged for that same four-year period or for such lesser period if the policy or contract was issued less than four years before the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this chapter, whichever is earlier.\n\n2. On and after the date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this chapter, whichever is earlier, exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting three percentage points from Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average as most recently available.\n\nd. A portion of a policy or contract issued to a plan or program of an employer, association, or other person to provide life, disability, or annuity benefits to its employees, members, or others, to the extent that the plan or program is self-funded or uninsured, including, but not limited to, benefits payable by an employer, association, or other person under any of the following:\n\n1. A multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. Section 1002(40)).\n\n2. A minimum premium group insurance plan.\n\n3. A stop-loss group insurance plan.\n\n4. An administrative services only contract.\n\ne. A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that it provides for any of the following:\n\n1. Dividends or experience rating credits.\n\n2. Voting rights.\n\n3. Payment of any fees or allowances to any person, including the policy or contract owner, in connection with the service to or administration of the policy or contract.\n\nf.

A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the assessments required by Section 27-44-9 with respect to the policy or contract are preempted by federal or state law.\n\nh. An obligation that does not arise under the express written terms of the policy or contract issued by the insurer to the contract owner or policy owner, including without limitation:\n\n1. Claims based on marketing materials.\n\n2. Claims based on side letters, riders, or other documents that were issued by the insurer without meeting applicable policy form filing or approval requirements.\n\n3. Misrepresentations of or regarding policy benefits.\n\n4. Extra-contractual claims, including, without limitation, claims relating to bad faith in the payment of claims, punitive or exemplary damages, or attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n5. A claim for penalties or consequential or incidental damages.\n\ni. A contractual agreement that establishes the member insurer’s obligations to provide a book value accounting guaranty for defined contribution benefit plan participants by reference to a portfolio of assets that is owned by the benefit plan or its trustee, which in each case is not an affiliate of the member insurer.\n\nj. An unallocated annuity contract.\n\nk. A portion of a policy or contract to the extent it provides for interest or other changes in value to be determined by the use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract, but which have not been credited to the policy or contract, or as to which the policy or contract owner’s rights are subject to forfeiture, as of the date the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this chapter, whichever is earlier. If a policy’s or contract’s interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, then for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subsection, the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be subject to forfeiture.\n\nl. A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug, or other health care benefits pursuant to Part C or Part D of Subchapter XVIII, Chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code (commonly known as Medicare Part C and D) or any regulations issued pursuant thereto.\n\n(c) The benefits that the association may become obligated to cover shall in no event exceed the lesser of:\n\n(1) The contractual obligations for which the insurer is liable or would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(2)a. With respect to one life, regardless of the number of policies or contracts:\n\n1. Three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in life insurance death benefits, but not more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values for life insurance.\n\n2. In disability insurance benefits:\n\n(i) One hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for coverages not defined as disability income insurance or basic hospital, medical, and surgical insurance or major medical insurance or long-term care insurance including any net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values.\n\n(ii) Three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for disability income insurance and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for long-term care insurance.\n\n(iii) Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for basic hospital, medical, and surgical insurance or major medical insurance.\n\n3. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values.\n\nb. With respect to each payee of a structured settlement annuity (or beneficiary or beneficiaries if the payee is deceased), two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in present value annuity benefits, in the aggregate, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values, if any.\n\nc. However, in no event shall the association be obligated to cover more than either of the following:\n\n1. An aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in benefits with respect to any one life under paragraphs a. and b. except with respect to benefits for basic hospital, medical, and surgical insurance and major medical insurance under paragraph a.2., in which case the aggregate liability of the association shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) with respect to any one individual.\n\n2. With respect to one owner of multiple non-group policies of life insurance, whether the policy owner is an individual, firm, corporation, or other person, and whether the persons insured are officers, managers, employees, or other persons, more than five million dollars ($5,000,000) in benefits, regardless of the number of policies and contracts held by the owner.\n\nd. The limitations set forth in this subsection are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either its subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies. The costs of the association’s obligations under this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.\n\n(d) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under Section 27-44-8, the association shall not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.\n\n(Acts 1982, No. 82-561, p. 922, §3; Acts 1993, No. 93-675, p. 1240, §11; Act 2012-319, p. 724, §1.)",

Guarantee, assume, or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, or reinsured, the covered policies of the insolvent insurer.\n\nb. Assure payment of the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.\n\nc. Provide such moneys, pledges, notes, guarantees, or other means as are reasonably necessary to discharge such duties.\n\n(2) Provide benefits and coverages in accordance with the following provisions:\n\na. With respect to life and disability insurance policies and annuities, assure payment of benefits for premiums identical to the premiums and benefits, except for terms of conversion and renewability, that would have been payable under the policies or contracts of the insolvent insurer, for claims incurred:\n\n1. With respect to group policies and contracts, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date under those policies or contracts or 45 days, but in no event less than 30 days, after the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policies and contracts.\n\n2. With respect to non-group policies, contracts, and annuities not later than the earlier of the next renewal date, if any, under the policies or contracts or one year, but in no event less than 30 days, from the date on which the association becomes obligated with respect to the policies or contracts.\n\nb. Make diligent efforts to provide all known insureds or annuitants (for non-group policies and contracts), or group policy owners with respect to group policies and contracts, 30 days’ notice of the termination (pursuant to paragraph a.) of the benefits provided.\n\nc. With respect to non-group life and disability insurance policies and annuities covered by the association, make available to each known insured or annuitant, or owner if other than the insured or annuitant, and with respect to an individual formerly insured or formerly an annuitant under a group policy who is not eligible for replacement group coverage, make available substitute coverage on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions of paragraph d., if the insureds or annuitants had a right under law or the terminated policy or annuity to convert coverage to individual coverage or to continue an individual policy or annuity in force until a specified age or for a specified time, during which the insurer had no right unilaterally to make changes in any provision of the policy or annuity or had a right only to make changes in premium by class.\n\nd.1. In providing the substitute coverage required under paragraph c., the association may offer either to reissue the terminated coverage or to issue an alternative policy.\n\n2. Alternative or reissued policies shall be offered without requiring evidence of insurability, and shall not provide for any waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the terminated policy.\n\n3. The association may reinsure any alternative or reissued policy.\n\ne.1. Alternative policies adopted by the association shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner. The association may adopt alternative policies of various types for future issuance without regard to any particular impairment or insolvency.\n\n2. Alternative policies shall contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in this state and provide benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. The association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates that it shall adopt. The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy was last underwritten.\n\n3. Any alternative policy issued by the association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the policy issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the association.\n\nf. If the association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy, the premium shall be set by the association in accordance with the amount of insurance provided and the age and class of risk, subject to approval of the commissioner.\n\ng. The association’s obligations with respect to coverage under any policy of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative policy shall cease on the date the coverage or policy is replaced by another similar policy by the policy owner, the insured, or the association.\n\nh. When proceeding under this subdivision (2) with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the association shall assure the payment or crediting of a rate of interest consistent with Section 27-44-3(b)(2)c.\n\n(c) Nonpayment of premiums within 31 days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative, or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall terminate the association’s obligations under the policy or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value which may be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(d) Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the association. If the liquidator of an insolvent insurer requests, the association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premium collected by the association. The association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the order.\n\n(e) The protection provided by this chapter shall not apply where any guaranty protection is provided to residents of this state by the laws of the domiciliary state or jurisdiction of the impaired or insolvent insurer other than this state.\n\n(f) In carrying out its duties under subsection (b), the association may, subject to approval by a court in this state:\n\n(1) Impose permanent policy or contract liens in connection with any guarantee, assumption, or reinsurance agreement, if the association finds that the amounts which can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association’s duties under this chapter, or that the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contract liens, to be in the public interest.\n\n(2) Impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan values. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or policy loans, or on any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans, or other rights by the association for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court.\n\n(g) If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time as provided in subsection (b), the commissioner shall have the powers and duties of the association under this chapter with respect to the insolvent insurer.\n\n(h) The association may render assistance and advice to the commissioner, upon the commissioner’s request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(i) The association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated under this chapter. Standing shall extend to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including, but not limited to, proposals for reinsuring, modifying, or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the covered policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The association shall also have the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person or property against whom the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise.\n\n(j)(1) A person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage or provision of substitute or alternative coverage. The association may require an assignment to it of such rights by any payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred by this chapter upon such person.\n\n(2) The subrogation rights of the association under this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter.\n\n(3) In addition to subdivisions (1) and (2), the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contract.\n\n(4) If the preceding provisions of this subsection are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(5) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in the preceding subdivisions of this subsection, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies, or portion thereof, covered by the association.\n\n(k) In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may:\n\n(1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter.\n\n(2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any unpaid assessments under Section 27-44-9 and to settle claims or potential claims against it.\n\n(3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter. Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets.\n\n(4) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter.\n\n(5) Take such legal action as may be necessary to avoid payment of improper claims.\n\n(6) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the commissioner, the powers of a domestic life or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter.\n\n(7) Organize itself as a corporation or in other legal forms permitted by the laws of the state.\n\n(8) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request.\n\n(9) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter.\n\n(l) The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.\n\n(m)(1)a. At any time within 180 days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, in each case under any one or more reinsurance contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers.\n\nb. To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available upon request to the association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings (i) copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed, and (ii) notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts.\n\nc. The following paragraphs 1. through 4. shall apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by the association:\n\n1. The association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge policies or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator.\n\n2. The association shall be entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of any such amounts, the association shall be obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy or annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of:\n\n(i) The amount received by the association.\n\n(ii) The excess of the amount received by the association over the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy or annuity less the retention of the insurer applicable to the loss or event.\n\n3. Within 30 days following the association’s election (the “election date”), the association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance contract as of the election date with respect to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subparagraph 2., the receiver shall remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable.\n\n4. If the association or receiver, on the association’s behalf, within 60 days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the election date that relate to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay premium insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies and annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, and shall not be entitled to set off any unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association.\n\n(2) During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date or, if the election date does not occur, until 180 days after the date of the order of liquidation:\n\na.1. Neither the association nor the reinsurer shall have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume under subdivision (1), whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation.\n\n2. The reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested.\n\nb. Provided that once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties’ rights and obligations shall be governed by subdivision (1).\n\n(3) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date pursuant to subdivision (1), the association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract.\n\n(4) When policies or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies or annuities may also be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed under subdivision (1), subject to all of the following:\n\na. Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred shall not cover any new policies of insurance or annuities in addition to those transferred.\n\nb. The obligations described in subdivision (1) shall no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer.\n\nc. Notice shall be given in writing, return receipt requested, by the transferring party to the affected reinsurer not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the transfer.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection shall supersede the provisions of any state law or of any affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the insolvent insurer or any other person. The receiver, shall remain entitled to any amount payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions.\n\n(6) Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this subsection shall alter or modify the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall give a policyholder or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall limit or affect the association’s rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. Nothing in this section shall apply to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks.\n\n(n) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner.\n\n(o) Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association’s obligations under this chapter, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.\n\n(p) Venue in a suit against the association arising under this chapter shall be in Jefferson County, Alabama. The association shall not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter.\n\n(q) In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subsection (a) or (b), the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with all of the following provisions:\n\n(1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for (i) a fixed interest rate, (ii) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees, or (iii) a different method for calculating interest or changes in value.\n\n(2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract.\n\n(3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.\n\n(Acts 1982, No. 82-561, p. 922, §8; Act 2012-319, p. 724, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 27-44-9\n\nAssessments.\n\n(a) For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than 30 days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at six percent per annum on and after the due date.\n\n(b) There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows:\n\n(1) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessment may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(2) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under Section 27-44-8 with regard to an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(c)(1) The amount of a Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a non-pro rata basis. The total of all Class A assessments shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300) per member insurer in any one calendar year. The amount of a Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n(2) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired, bears to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers.\n\n(3) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subsection (b) and computation of assessments under this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within 180 days after the assessment is authorized.\n\n(d) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.\n\n(e)(1)a. Subject to the provisions of paragraph b., the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in one calendar year exceed one percent of that member insurer’s average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\nb. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in paragraph a. shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable account as calculated pursuant to this section.\n\nc. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in one year in the account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter.\n\n(2) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.\n\n(f) The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses or claims.\n\n(g) It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policyowner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter.\n\n(h) The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, for the amount of the assessment so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the commissioner may approve.\n\n(i)(1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest.\n\n(2) Within 60 days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest.\n\n(3) Within 30 days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within 60 days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the commissioner.\n\n(4) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the commissioner for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association.\n\n(5) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member company. Interest on a refund due a protesting member shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.\n\n(j) The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request.\n\n(Acts 1982, No. 82-561, p. 922, §9; Act 2012-319, p. 724, §1.)",

Records of such negotiations or meetings shall be made public only upon the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under Section 27-44-15.\n\n(c) For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to Section 27-44-8(8). Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subsection, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.\n\n(d)(1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders and policyowners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such insolvent insurer. In such a determination consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders of the continuing or successor insurer.\n\n(2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under Section 27-44-8 with respect to such insurer have been fully recovered by the association.\n\n(e)(1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4) of this subsection.\n\n(2) No such dividend shall be recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\n(3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.\n\n(4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.\n\n(5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) of this subsection is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.\n\n(Acts 1982, No. 82-561, p. 922, §14.)",
