The Legislature declares its intent is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom they owe obligations. In furtherance of that state interest, the Legislature provides a mandate that upon the insolvency of a non-U.S. insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its U.S. obligations in accordance with this chapter, the assets representing the security shall be maintained in the United States and claims shall be filed with and valued by the Commissioner of Insurance with regulatory oversight, and the assets shall be distributed, in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic U.S. insurance companies. The Legislature declares that the matters contained in this chapter are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-1012.\n\n(Act 2013-209, p. 463, §1.)",

To enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insurers. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination.\n\n(b)(1) Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this section unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by either:\n\na. The commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled.\n\nb. The commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.\n\n(2) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s U.S. ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(3) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No later than February 28 of each year the trustee of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust’s investments at the preceding year-end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31.\n\n(c) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurer:\n\n(1) The trust fund for a single assuming insurer shall consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000), except as provided in subdivision (2).\n\n(2) At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of U.S. ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers covered by the trust.\n\n(3)a. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:\n\n1. For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment, or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group.\n\n2. For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter’s several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.\n\n3. In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be held jointly for the benefit of the U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.\n\nb. The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.\n\nc. Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group.\n\n(4) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall do all of the following:\n\na. Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three (3) years immediately prior to making application for accreditation.\n\nb. Maintain aggregate policyholders’ surplus of at least ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000).\n\nc. Maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group.\n\nd. In addition, maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be held jointly for the benefit of U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities.\n\ne. Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, make available to the commissioner an annual certification of each underwriter member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant.\n\n(Act 2013-209, p. 463, §1.)",

In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet all of the following requirements:\n\n(1) The assuming insurer must be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (c).\n\n(2) The assuming insurer must maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the commissioner pursuant to regulation.\n\n(3) The assuming insurer must maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissioner pursuant to regulation.\n\n(4) The assuming insurer must agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final U.S. judgment.\n\n(5) The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis.\n\n(6) The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the commissioner.\n\n(b) An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. In order to be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying requirements of subsection (a):\n\n(1) The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commissioner to provide adequate protection.\n\n(2) The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.\n\n(3) Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association’s domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the association’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.\n\n(c)(1) The commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer.\n\n(2) In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-U.S. assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-U.S. jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the U.S. A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within the jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final U.S. judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner.\n\n(3) A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the National Associations of Insurance Commissioners committee process. The commissioner shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the commissioner shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations.\n\n(4) U.S. jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the National Associations of Insurance Commissioners financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.\n\n(5) If a certified reinsurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer’s certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.\n\n(d) The commissioner shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissioner pursuant to regulation. The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.\n\n(e)(1) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from U.S. ceding insurers under this subsection at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the commissioner.\n\n(2) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of Section 27-5B-14, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with Section 27-5B-7, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(3) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to Section 27-5B-7, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this section or comparable laws of other U.S. jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to Section 27-5B-7. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.\n\n(4) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in Section 27-5B-7 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this section, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars ($10,000,000).\n\n(5) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this section, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer’s obligations will not be paid in full when due.\n\n(6)a. For purposes of this section, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations.\n\nb. As used in this section, the term “terminated” refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.\n\nc. If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this chapter, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.\n\n(f) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction’s certification, and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.\n\n(g) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.\n\n(Act 2013-209, p. 463, §1.)",

A reciprocal jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:\n\na. A non-U.S. jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this subsection, a covered agreement is an agreement entered into pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. §§313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance.\n\nb. A U.S. jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program.\n\nc. A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 27-5B-8, which is not otherwise described in paragraph a. or b. and which meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the commissioner by rule.\n\n(2) The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in regulation. If the assuming reinsurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to set forth by rule.\n\n(3) The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, which shall be set forth by rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed.\n\n(4) The assuming insurer shall agree and provide adequate assurance to the commissioner, in a form specified by the commissioner pursuant to rule, to all of the following:\n\na. The assuming insurer shall provide prompt written notice and explanation to the commissioner if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subdivisions (2) and (3), or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law.\n\nb. The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the commissioner as agent for service of process. The commissioner may require that consent for service of process be provided to the commissioner and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent the agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws.\n\nc. The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, which have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained.\n\nd. Each reinsurance agreement shall include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate.\n\ne. The assuming insurer shall confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement which involves this state’s ceding insurers, and agrees to notify the ceding insurer and the commissioner and to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer’s liabilities to the ceding insurer should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. The security shall be in a form consistent with Sections 27-5B-8 and 27-5B-14 and as specified by the commissioner by rule.\n\n(5) The assuming insurer or its legal successor shall provide, if requested by the commissioner, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the commissioner as specified by the commissioner by rule.\n\n(6) The assuming insurer shall maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements pursuant to criteria set forth by rule.\n\n(7) The assuming insurer’s supervisory authority shall confirm to the commissioner on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in subdivisions (2) and (3).\n\n(8) Nothing in this subsection precludes an assuming insurer from providing the commissioner with information on a voluntary basis.\n\n(b)(1) The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.\n\n(2) A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the NAIC Committee Process. The commissioner’s list shall include any reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in paragraph a. or b. of subdivision (a)(1), and shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the NAIC list. The commissioner may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under rules adopted by the commissioner.\n\n(3) The commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction in accordance with a process set forth in rules adopted by the commissioner, except that the commissioner shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined in paragraph a. or b. of subdivision (1) of subsection (a). Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer which has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this section and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this section.
