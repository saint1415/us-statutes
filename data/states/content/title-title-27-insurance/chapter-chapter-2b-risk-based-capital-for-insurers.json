In addition, every domestic insurer shall file its RBC report with:\n\n(1) The NAIC according to the RBC instructions.\n\n(2) The insurance commissioner in any state in which the insurer is authorized to do business, if the insurance commissioner has notified the insurer of its request in writing, in which case the insurer shall file its RBC report not later than the later of either of the following:\n\na. Fifteen days from the receipt of notice to file its RBC report with that state.\n\nb. The filing date.\n\n(b) A life and health insurer’s and a fraternal benefit society’s RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions. The formula shall take into account, and may adjust for the covariance between, the following factors determined in each case by applying the factors in the manner set forth in the RBC instructions:\n\n(1) The risk with respect to the insurer’s assets.\n\n(2) The risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurer’s liabilities and obligations.\n\n(3) The interest rate risk with respect to the insurer’s business.\n\n(4) All other business risks and other relevant risks as are set forth in the RBC instructions.\n\nSubdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, shall be determined in each case by applying the factors in the manner set forth in the RBC instructions.\n\n(c) A property and casualty insurer’s and a health organization’s RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions.

Accordingly, insurers should seek to maintain capital above the RBC levels required by this chapter. Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure an insurer against various risks inherent in or affecting the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this chapter.\n\n(e) If a domestic insurer files an RBC report which in the judgment of the commissioner is inaccurate, then the commissioner shall adjust the RBC report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the insurer of the adjustment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment. An RBC report as so adjusted is referred to as an “adjusted RBC report.”\n\n(Acts 1996, No. 96-784, p. 1426, §8; Act 2013-194, p. 365, §1; Act 2014-377, p. 1407, §2.)",

Therefore, except as otherwise required under the provisions of this chapter, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing, directly or indirectly to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing an assertion, representation, or statement with regard to the RBC levels of any insurer, or of any component derived in the calculation, by any insurer, agent, broker, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business, would be misleading and is therefore prohibited. Except, if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding an insurer’s total adjusted capital to its RBC levels, or any of them, or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the insurer’s RBC levels is published in any written publication, and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of the statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the insurer may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.\n\n(f) It is the further judgment of the Legislature that the RBC instructions, RBC reports, adjusted RBC reports, RBC plans, and revised RBC plans are intended solely for use by the commissioner in monitoring the solvency of insurers and the need for possible corrective action with respect to insurers and shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance which an insurer or any affiliate is authorized to write.\n\n(Acts 1996, No. 96-784, p. 1426, §14; Act 2017-228, §1.)",
