In computing the total liabilities of any person to a bank, there shall be included all liabilities to the bank of any partnership or any unincorporated association of which such person is a member, any loans made for such person’s benefit or for the benefit of such partnership or unincorporated association, and any loans made to, or for the benefit of, a corporation of which such person owns 35 percent or more of the capital.\n\nc. In computing the total liabilities of any partnership or unincorporated association to a bank, there shall be included all liabilities of its individual members to such bank, loans made for the benefit of such partnership or unincorporated association or any member thereof, and any loan made to, or for the benefit of, any corporation of which any member owns 35 percent or more of the capital.\n\nd. In computing the total liabilities of any corporation to a bank, there shall be included all loans made for the benefit of the corporation, and all loans to, or for the benefit of any partnership or unincorporated association, or any member thereof, who owns 35 percent or more of the capital of such corporation.\n\ne. In computing the total liabilities of any person to a bank, direct or indirect loans to such person’s spouse will be aggregated and treated as loans to such person until the bank can satisfy the superintendent that each spouse has a separate net worth and available assets or cash flow to independently repay and service each individual spouse’s debts, and such net worth, assets, or cash flow of each is not dependent on decisions made or actions taken by the other.\n\nf. In computing total liabilities of any person to a bank, any credit exposure to a person arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the bank and the person shall be included. For the purposes of this paragraph the term derivative transaction shall include any transaction that is a contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note, or option that is based, in whole or in part, on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities, securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices, or other assets.\n\n(d) There shall be excluded from the limits set forth in subsection (a) the following:\n\n(1) Indebtedness evidenced by commercial paper drawn in good faith against actually existing values and secured by a security interest upon goods in transit with shippers’ order, bills of lading, or comparable instruments attached;\n\n(2) Deposits in a reserve depository or a Federal Reserve Bank;\n\n(3) Loans to the extent secured by:\n\na. Obligations of, and obligations guaranteed by the United States, the State of Alabama, any political subdivision of the State of Alabama, any public body of the State of Alabama, or a public body of any political subdivision of the State of Alabama if the obligations or guarantees are general obligations thereof;\n\nb.

If such reduction is not made by the bank within 30 days of the superintendent’s order, the superintendent may take appropriate action, including ordering the excess charged to profit and loss if, in his or her opinion, such excess is not well secured, or may by order impose civil money penalties against the bank not to exceed the amount of interest and fees paid or contracted to be paid to the bank on the loan or loans in excess of the amount fixed in this section.
