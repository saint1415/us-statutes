If the instrument under which the trust institution acts as fiduciary, whether such fiduciary capacity arose before or is created after July 8, 1943, shall authorize investments of moneys of the estate in a common trust fund or in investments other than those designated by law as legal investments or shall authorize the trust institution, either alone or in conjunction with any person acting with it in a fiduciary capacity, to exercise its or their discretion with respect to the investment of moneys of the estate, the trust institution may, in its capacity as sole fiduciary or with the consent of any person acting with it in a fiduciary capacity, invest and reinvest moneys of the estate in any such common trust fund maintained by it or by an affiliated trust institution.

In order to determine whether the investment of funds received or held by a trust institution as fiduciary in a participation in a common trust fund is proper, the trust institution may consider the common trust fund as a whole and shall not, for example, be prohibited from making such investment because any particular asset is nonincome-producing.\n\n(Acts 1980, No. 80-658, §5-12-6.)",
