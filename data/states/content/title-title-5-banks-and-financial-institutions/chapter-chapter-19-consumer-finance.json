      "text": "Section 5-19-1\n\nDefinitions.\n\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:\n\n(1) FINANCE CHARGE. The sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The amount of the finance charge in connection with any credit transaction (i) shall be determined, and shall include and exclude the fees and charges, as provided by Section 106 of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1605 and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board promulgated pursuant to the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 12 C.F.R. Part 226, and the Official Staff Commentary adopted by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to that regulation, and without limiting or affecting the foregoing subparagraph (i), (ii) shall exclude, without limitation, late charges and other charges resulting from or arising out of late payment, delinquency, default, or other like occurrence. For the purpose of determining the permissible finance charge, any discount or point paid by the debtor in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by a mortgage on real estate, even though paid at one time, shall be spread over the stated term of the consumer credit transaction. The administrator from time to time may promulgate regulations pursuant to Section 5-19-21 further establishing charges and fees which constitute a finance charge and the manner in which the finance charge is determined to assure consistency between the meaning of “finance charge” under this chapter and the meaning and application of “finance charge” under the above-referenced Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, regulations and Official Staff Commentary, as the same may be amended from time to time.\n\n(2) CONSUMER. When used as an adjective with reference to a credit transaction, characterizes the credit transaction as one in which the party to whom credit is extended is a natural person and the money, property, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\n\n(3) CREDITOR. A person who regularly extends or arranges for the extension of credit for which the payment of a finance charge is required, whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise. The provisions of this chapter apply to any such creditor irrespective of the creditor’s status as a natural person or any type of organization. A person is a creditor only if the person extended or arranged for the extension of credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or more than five times in the preceding calendar year for credit transactions secured by a residential structure that contains one to four units.\n\n(4) CREDIT SALE. Any sale with respect to which credit is extended or arranged by a seller who is a creditor. The term includes any contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the property or services involved and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee may become for no other or a nominal consideration the owner of the property upon full compliance with the bailee’s or lessee’s obligations under the contract. A rental-purchase agreement which is subject to the provisions of Chapter 25 of Title 8 is not a credit sale.\n\n(5) OPEN-END CREDIT PLAN. A plan prescribing the terms of credit transactions which may be made thereunder from time to time and under the terms of which a finance charge may be charged from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance.\n\n(6) ADMINISTRATOR. The Superintendent of Banks of the State Banking Department.\n\n(7) SUPERVISOR OF THE BUREAU OF LOANS. The designated deputy administrator for the purpose of enforcing this chapter as to licensees.\n\n(8) HOME SOLICITATION SALE. A consumer credit sale of goods or services, other than motor vehicles, in which the seller or a person acting for the seller engages in a personal solicitation of the sale at a place other than the seller’s place of business and the buyer’s agreement or offer to purchase is there given to the seller or a person acting for the seller. The term does not include a sale made pursuant to a preexisting open-end credit plan, a closed-end plan providing for a series of sales or a sale made pursuant to prior negotiations between the parties at the seller’s place of business where goods or services are offered or exhibited for sale.\n\n(9) CREDIT TRANSACTION. A loan or credit sale made by a creditor. For purposes only of Sections 5-19-1(1) and 5-19-3, “credit transaction” shall include nonconsumer loans and credit sales as well as consumer loans and consumer credit sales with an original amount financed of less than two thousand dollars ($2,000). Otherwise, the term “credit transaction” refers only to consumer loans and consumer credit sales irrespective of whether the term is preceded by the word “consumer.”\n\n(10) AMOUNT FINANCED. The sum determined by adding the principal loan amount or the cash price in a credit sale, less any down payment, and any other amounts that are financed by the creditor.\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 2052, p. 3290, §1; Acts 1979, No. 79-428, p. 673, §1; Acts 1986, No. 86-304, p. 451, §1; Acts 1986, No. 86-497, p. 945, §7; Acts 1996, No. 96-576, p. 887, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 5-19-3\n\nMaximum Finance Charges; Contracting for Minimum Finance Charge; Alternate Per Month Computed Finance Charge.\n\n(a) Except under open-end credit plans, the maximum finance charge for any credit transaction where the original amount financed is less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), may equal but may not exceed the total of the following:\n\n(1) Fifteen dollars ($15) per one hundred dollars ($100) per year for the first seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) of the original amount financed; and\n\n(2) Ten dollars ($10) per one hundred dollars ($100) per year for that portion of the original amount financed exceeding seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) and less than two thousand dollars ($2,000).\n\nThe maximum finance charge under this subsection shall be determined by computing the maximum rates authorized by this subsection on the original amount financed for the full term of the contract without regard to scheduled payments and the maximum finance charge so determined, or any lesser amount, may be added to the original amount financed. The finance charge may be calculated and expressed as a simple interest charge or by any method which does not result in a finance charge yield greater than the yield permitted by this subsection.\n\n(b) A creditor, in connection with any credit sale other than a sale made under an open-end credit plan, may contract for and receive a minimum finance charge not in excess of the following amounts:\n\n(1) Four dollars ($4) on any credit sale in which the amount financed is twenty-five dollars ($25) or less; and\n\n(2) Six dollars ($6) on any credit sale in which the amount financed is more than twenty-five dollars ($25).\n\n(c) In an open-end credit plan, if there is an unpaid balance on the date as of which the finance charge is applied, a creditor may contract for and receive a minimum finance charge in an amount not exceeding fifty cents ($.50) per month.\n\n(d) Other than under an open-end credit plan, in any credit transaction where the finance charge is computed on the unpaid balance of the amount financed outstanding from time to time, for the actual time outstanding:\n\n(1) Each payment shall be applied first to accrued charges and the remainder of the payment applied to the unpaid balance of the amount financed, except that if the amount of the payment is insufficient to pay the accumulated charges, unpaid charges continue to accumulate to be paid from the proceeds of subsequent payments and are not added to the unpaid amount financed.\n\n(2) Except for permissible prepaid finance charges, the finance charge shall not be payable in advance, or compounded; however, if part or all of the consideration for a new credit transaction contract is the unpaid amount financed and unpaid accrued charges of a prior credit transaction, then the amount financed under the new credit transaction contract may include any unpaid accrued charges. The resulting credit transaction contract shall be deemed a new and separate credit transaction for all purposes.\n\n(3) Debtors may pay in advance the unpaid balance of the amount financed and all accrued finance charges without penalty.\n\n(4) For purposes of computing finance charges for a fraction of a month, a day may be considered one-thirtieth of a month, at the option of the creditor.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any credit transaction with an original amount financed that is equal to or greater than two thousand dollars ($2,000). The finance charge for any credit transaction with an original amount financed or original principal balance not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000) and for any open-end credit plan with a credit limit not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8-8-5, or Sections 5-20-2, et seq., as applicable.

The late charge may be collected only once on any scheduled payment, regardless of the period during which the scheduled payment remains in default.\n\n(b) With respect to the deferral of one or more wholly unpaid scheduled payments in a consumer credit transaction, in which the finance charge was determined by the precomputed method, the creditor may collect, by agreement with the debtor either before or after default, an additional charge for each full month that any wholly unpaid scheduled payments are outstanding after the due date of each scheduled payment equal to that proportion of the finance charge which the amount of the deferred monthly scheduled payment bears to the sum of all monthly balances originally scheduled.\n\n(c) Except as otherwise provided by law, when any debt is paid in full before the final scheduled payment date, the debtor may do so without penalty, and the creditor shall refund or credit the debtor with not less than that portion of the finance charge which shall be due the debtor as follows:\n\n(1)a. In the case of a consumer credit transaction with an original term of more than 61 months according to any generally accepted actuarial method of computation established or otherwise approved by the administrator; and\n\nb. In all other consumer credit transactions according to the rule of 78ths or sum of the digits method, meaning the amount of the refund or credit shall be as great a proportion of the finance charge originally contracted for as the sum of the periodic time balances of the debt scheduled to follow the date of prepayment bears to the sum of all the periodic time balances of the debt, both sums to be determined according to the scheduled payments originally contracted for.\n\n(2) No refund of less than one dollar ($1) need be made.\n\n(3) If the prepayment is made by the debtor other than on a scheduled payment date, the nearest scheduled payment date shall be used in the computation.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided by law, when any debt is renewed or refinanced by any creditor or creditor’s affiliate within a period of 90 days from the date the debt is made or incurred, the debtor shall be entitled to a pro rata refund or credit of any unearned portion of the original finance charge computed as of the date of such refinancing or renewal. When the renewal or refinancing occurs after 90 days, any refund or credit shall be calculated as provided in subsection (c) above. On and after January 1, 1997, except as otherwise provided by law, when any debt is renewed or refinanced by any creditor or creditor’s affiliate within a period of 120 days from the date the debt is made or incurred, the debtor shall be entitled to a pro rata refund or credit of any unearned portion of the original finance charge computed as of the date of such refinancing or renewal. When the renewal or refinancing occurs after 120 days, any refund or credit shall be calculated as provided in subsection (c) above.\n\n(e) When any consumer debt is renewed or refinanced by the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor, any minimum finance charge for a credit sale shall be reduced to the finance charge which is otherwise permitted by Section 5-19-3.\n\n(f) A creditor may charge and collect in a transaction secured by real property the following fees and charges if bona fide and reasonable in amount, and provided that, other than the appraisal fees authorized by subdivision (4) and fees and charges authorized by regulations promulgated by the administrator, the fees are paid to parties unrelated to the creditor:\n\n(1) Fees for title examination, abstract of title, title insurance, property survey, pest inspection, flood inspection, and similar purposes;\n\n(2) Fees for preparing deeds, mortgages, and reconveyance, settlement, and similar documents;\n\n(3) Notary fees and credit report fees;\n\n(4) Appraisal fees paid to persons licensed under the provisions of the Alabama Real Estate Appraisers Act, whether or not the appraiser is employed by or otherwise related to the creditor; and\n\n(5) Fees and charges prescribed by law which are or will be paid to public officials or agencies for recording or releasing a lien on property which secured the loan, provided, however, that a releasing fee may only be charged and collected at or after the time the lien is released.\n\n(6) The administrator may by regulation promulgated pursuant to Section 5-19-21 authorize other fees and charges.\n\n(g) A creditor may, pursuant to a consumer credit transaction contract secured by an interest in real property, charge and collect points in an amount not to exceed five percent of the original principal balance in the case of a closed-end consumer credit transaction, or five percent of the total line of credit in the case of an open-end credit plan. Points may be paid in cash at the time of the consumer credit transaction, or may be deducted from the proceeds and included in the original amount financed for the purposes of Section 5-19-3 or financed under the open-end credit plan. Points shall be in addition to all other charges, are fully earned on the date of the consumer credit transaction, and may be excluded from the finance charge for the purpose of computing any finance charge credit or refund.\n\n(h) Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall not apply to open-end credit plans. The requirements of a refund or credit of any unearned finance charge under subsections (c) and (d) of this section apply only if and to the extent the consumer credit transaction includes a precomputed or prepaid finance charge.\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 2052, p. 3290, §3; Acts 1975, 4th Ex.

If the debtor is entitled to a refund and the creditor refuses to refund within a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days, after written demand, including the filing of a legal action, the debtor shall recover a penalty of five times the amount of the actual economic damages not to exceed the finance charge, but in any event not less than one hundred dollars ($100).

If the debtor is entitled to a refund and the creditor refuses to refund within a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days, after written demand, including the filing of a legal action, the debtor shall recover twice the actual economic damages not to exceed the finance charge, but in any event not less than one hundred dollars ($100).\n\n(2) If the creditor has made an excess finance charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this chapter, the creditor shall forfeit the greater of the entire finance charge imposed or five times the amount of the actual economic damages, but not less than one hundred dollars ($100). No action under this subsection may be brought more than one year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made or, in the case of an open-end credit plan, one year after the excess charge is made.\n\n(3) Any creditor licensed under this chapter adjudged after May 20, 1996 by a court of competent jurisdiction in any civil action to be in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this chapter shall within 10 days of such adjudication forward a copy of the judgment to the administrator. Within 10 days of such judgment becoming final and nonappealable, the creditor shall notify the administrator and the administrator shall, within 60 days of such notification, review the creditor’s license in view of the matters on which the judgment was based and determine whether to conduct a license revocation hearing pursuant to Section 5-19-23. At any hearing conducted thereon by the administrator, such judgment shall be prima facie evidence in support of the revocation of the creditor’s license.\n\n(b) A creditor required to obtain a license who fails to obtain such license may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this state on a consumer credit transaction for which a license was required until the creditor obtains the license required by Section 5-19-22. If a court determines that an unlicensed creditor should have obtained a license, the action may be stayed until the creditor obtains the required license and satisfies the requirements of the next sentence of this subsection. The creditor shall pay to the administrator a civil penalty equal to three times the amount of the investigation fee and the annual license fee for each year or portion thereof, the creditor, in violation of Section 5-19-22, has engaged in the business of making consumer loans or taking assignments of consumer credit contracts without first having obtained a license, but in no event shall a civil penalty exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). All civil penalties shall be paid into the special fund set up by the State Treasurer pursuant to Section 5-2A-20 and used in the supervision and examination of licensees. After obtaining the required license, and paying the civil penalty prescribed by this subsection, the creditor may bring and maintain proceedings in the courts of this state on consumer credit transaction contracts, and the enforceability of the contracts shall not be impaired by the prior failure to obtain a license, irrespective of whether the consumer credit transaction contracts were made before or after the license was obtained. No private cause of action exists against a creditor for failing to obtain a license required by Section 5-19-22.\n\n(c) Except for the specific remedies and obligations provided in subsection (a) with respect to excess finance charges, or subsection (b) with respect to licensing, in which event the remedy and obligations set forth in subsection (a) or (b), as applicable, shall apply, any provision of a consumer credit transaction which violates this chapter shall be unenforceable by the creditor to the extent, but only to the extent, of the violation, and the other remaining provisions and agreements shall be enforceable and shall not be void and shall not be affected by the violation. Except as provided in subsection (a), any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter with respect to any person is liable to the person only for the actual economic damages sustained by the person as the result of the failure. Except as set forth in subsection (a), no action may be brought by the debtor under this section based upon a violation of any provision of this chapter more than two years after the date the violation occurred; provided, however, this limitation shall not bar a debtor from asserting a violation of this chapter in an action brought by the creditor, as a matter of defense by recoupment or setoff in such action, if otherwise allowed by law.\n\n(d) A creditor or assignee has no liability to the debtor for any violation of this chapter if, prior to receipt of written notice from the debtor of a violation, the creditor or assignee notifies the debtor of the violation and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account, or payments to the debtor, as are necessary to assure that the debtor will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charges permitted by this chapter.\n\n(e) An oral statement shall not be admissible to contradict the provisions of a credit transaction document, unless the debtor establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the oral statement was made and that it constituted a misrepresentation of a material fact relating to the character or essential terms of the transaction that was made principally to induce the debtor to sign the document and upon which the debtor reasonably relied in signing the document or entering into the transaction. This subsection shall not apply to credit transaction documents in effect on May 20, 1996, nor to causes of action that arise therefrom; nor shall this subsection apply to any credit transaction documents not covered by this chapter.\n\n(f) A consumer credit transaction does not create or give rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the creditor.\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 2052, p. 3290, §15; Acts 1996, No. 96-576, p. 887, §2.)",

The administrator may promulgate regulations pursuant to Section 5-19-21 to provide further for the term and maximum permissible amount of insurance which covers the creditor’s interest in the property.\n\n(d) The premium for nonfiling insurance, insuring the lien of the creditor on any property which is collateral for the consumer credit transaction, may not exceed the cost of filing of a lien on the property and any document necessary to continue the lien and is nonrefundable. The insurance may be required in both purchase money and nonpurchase money secured transactions. A creditor may not charge a debtor the cost of filing the lien and a premium for nonfiling insurance in a consumer credit transaction.\n\n(e) If a creditor requires any insurance against loss of or damage to any property in which the creditor is given a security interest, the debtor shall have and be given written notice of the option of obtaining the insurance through a person of the debtor’s choice. If the debtor does not exercise the option of providing the insurance through an existing policy or a policy independently obtained and paid for by the debtor, the creditor may purchase the insurance on the property and charge the premium for the insurance to the debtor. The premium or premiums charged for such required insurance shall not exceed the premium approved by the administrator or the rates filed by the insurer with the Alabama Department of Insurance, as applicable. The creditor may, for reasonable cause, decline the insurance provided by the debtor.\n\n(f) When property insurance, as permitted herein, is required by the creditor, is not furnished by the debtor, and is purchased by the creditor, then upon renewal, refinancing, or payment of the debt before the final maturity date, the creditor shall refund or credit the debtor with that portion of the premium refunded by the insurance carrier upon the termination of the insurance.\n\n(g) A creditor may not contract for or receive a separate charge for insurance against loss of or damage to property or against liability for property damage or personal injuries unless the original amount financed exclusive of the charges for insurance is three hundred dollars ($300) or more and the value of the property is three hundred dollars ($300) or more.\n\n(h) In no event shall the creditor have any responsibility or liability for the failure to purchase any insurance permitted by this section unless the creditor has affirmatively undertaken in writing to purchase the insurance.\n\n(i) A creditor may offer and finance any other insurance in connection with any consumer credit transaction upon such terms as are authorized by regulation of the administrator.\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 2052, p. 3290, §16; Acts 1986, No. 86-304, p. 451, §3; Acts 1987, No. 87-766, p. 1494; Acts 1996, No. 96-576, p. 887, §2.)",

The date of publication in the Alabama Administrative Monthly shall constitute the date of notice. The notice shall include a statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subject and issues involved, shall specify a notice period ending not less than 35 days or more than 90 days from the date of the notice, during which period interested persons may present their views thereon, and shall specify the place where, and the manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon.\n\n(2) All interested persons shall have a reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in writing. The administrator shall consider all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation. Upon adoption of a regulation, the administrator, if conflicting views are submitted on the proposed regulation and if requested in writing to do so by an interested person prior to adoption, shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption, incorporating therein its reasons for overruling any considerations urged against its adoption.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, if the administrator finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires adoption of a regulation upon fewer than 35 days’ notice or that action is required by or to comply with a federal statute or regulation which requires adoption of a regulation upon fewer than 35 days’ notice and states in writing its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable, to adopt an emergency regulation. The regulation shall become effective immediately, unless otherwise stated therein. The regulation may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days unless within such time the administrator complies with the procedures set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). The adoption of the same or a substantially similar regulation following the procedures set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) at any time is not limited by the adoption of a regulation following the emergency regulation procedure set forth in this subsection.\n\n(4) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the State Banking Department, other than rehearing, and who is aggrieved by a final decision of the administrator with respect to a regulation, is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. All proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing of notice of appeal or review and a cost bond with the administrator to cover the reasonable costs of preparing the transcript of the proceeding under review, unless waived by the administrator or the court on a showing of substantial hardship. The notice of appeal and cost bond must be filed within 42 days after the date the administrator issued its final regulation. The appeal shall be filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County. The regulation will be in effect pending the outcome of any appeal unless the administrator stays the effective date of the regulation.\n\n(c) As to transactions entered into after May 20, 1996, a creditor shall have no liability under this chapter for any act or practice done or omitted in conformity with any (i) regulation of the administrator, or (ii) any rule, regulation, interpretation, or approval of any applicable Alabama or federal agency or any opinion of the Attorney General, notwithstanding that after such act or omission has occurred, the regulation, rule, interpretation, opinion, or approval is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason; provided, however, that any interpretation or opinion issued after May 20, 1996, shall not have any effect on any litigation pending on May 20, 1996, nor shall any interpretation or opinion issued after May 20, 1996, have any effect on litigation if issued subsequent to filing of the litigation. The enactment of Act 96-576 shall have no effect on interpretations or opinions issued prior to May 20, 1996.\n\n(d) A creditor, acting in conformity with a written interpretation or approval by the administrator or the administrator’s designee, or by the official in charge of any applicable Alabama agency or department, or by an official of any federal agency or department, shall be presumed to have acted in accordance with applicable law, notwithstanding that after such act has occurred, the interpretation or approval is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be incorrect or invalid for any reason.\n\n(e) Interpretations, opinions, and approvals shall protect, to the extent provided in subsections (c) and (d), as applicable, both the creditor at whose request they were issued and any other creditor in a materially like circumstance.\n\n(Acts 1971, No. 2052, p. 3290, §17; Acts 1996, No. 96-576, p. 887, §2.)",
