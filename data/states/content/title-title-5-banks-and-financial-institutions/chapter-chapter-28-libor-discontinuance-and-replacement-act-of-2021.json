An index of interest rates or dividend rates that is used, in whole or in part, as the basis of, or as a reference for, calculating or determining any valuation, payment, or other measurement under or in respect of a contract, security, or instrument.\n\n(2) BENCHMARK REPLACEMENT. A benchmark, or an interest rate or dividend rate, which may or may not be based in whole or in part on a prior setting of LIBOR, to replace LIBOR or any interest rate or dividend rate based on LIBOR, whether on a temporary, permanent, or indefinite basis, under or in respect of a contract, security, or instrument.\n\n(3) BENCHMARK REPLACEMENT CONFORMING CHANGES. With respect to any type of contract, security, or instrument, any technical, administrative, or operational changes, alterations, or modifications that are associated with and reasonably necessary to the use, adoption, calculation, or implementation of a recommended benchmark replacement and that both:\n\na. Have been selected or recommended by a relevant recommending body; and\n\nb. If, in the reasonable judgment of the calculating person, the benchmark replacement conforming changes selected or recommended pursuant to paragraph a. do not apply to the contract, security, or instrument or are insufficient to permit administration and calculation of the recommended benchmark replacement, then benchmark replacement conforming changes shall include other changes, alterations, or modifications that, in the reasonable judgment of the calculating person, are necessary to permit administration and calculation of the recommended benchmark replacement under or in respect of the contract, security, or instrument in a manner consistent with market practice for substantially similar contracts, securities, or instruments and, to the extent practicable, the manner in which the contract, security, or instrument was administered immediately prior to the LIBOR replacement date; and would not result in a disposition of the contract, security, or instrument for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n(4) CALCULATING PERSON. With respect to any contract, security, or instrument, any person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation, payment, or other measurement based on a benchmark. This person may be the determining person.\n\n(5) CONTRACT, SECURITY, OR INSTRUMENT.

Notify other persons of the occurrence of a LIBOR discontinuance event, a LIBOR replacement date, or a benchmark replacement.\n\n(7) FALLBACK PROVISIONS. Terms in a contract, security, or instrument that set forth a methodology or procedure for determining a benchmark replacement, including any terms relating to the date on which the benchmark replacement becomes effective, without regard to whether a benchmark replacement can be determined in accordance with the methodology or procedure.\n\n(8) LIBOR. For purposes of the application of this chapter to any particular contract, security, or instrument, U.S. dollar LIBOR, formerly known as the London Interbank Offered Rate, as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, or any predecessor or successor thereof, or any tenor thereof, as applicable, that is used in making any calculation or determination thereunder.\n\n(9) LIBOR DISCONTINUANCE EVENT.

Permits a party to choose from more than one tenor of LIBOR and any of the tenors is not so affected or if the contract, security, or instrument requires interpolation, can be interpolated from LIBOR tenors that are not so affected.\n\n(10)a.

The date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein.\n\n2. The date on which the administrator of LIBOR permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide LIBOR.\n\nb. In the case of a LIBOR discontinuance event described in paragraph (9)c., the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein.

Based in any way on any LIBOR value.\n\nb. The substantive equivalent of subdivision (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of Section 5-28-4.\n\n(2) A determining person shall have the authority under this chapter, but shall not be required, to select on or after the occurrence of a LIBOR discontinuance event the recommended benchmark replacement as the benchmark replacement.

Made by the earlier of either the LIBOR replacement date, or the latest date for selecting a benchmark replacement according to the contract, security, or instrument.\n\nc. Used in any determinations of the benchmark under or with respect to the contract, security, or instrument occurring on and after the LIBOR replacement date.\n\n(d) If a recommended benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for any contract, security, or instrument pursuant to this section, then all benchmark replacement conforming changes that are applicable to the recommended benchmark replacement shall become an integral part of the contract, security, or instrument by operation of law.\n\n(e) This chapter shall not alter or impair any of the following:\n\n(1) Any written agreement by all requisite parties that, retrospectively or prospectively, a contract, security, or instrument shall not be subject to this chapter without necessarily referring specifically to this chapter.
