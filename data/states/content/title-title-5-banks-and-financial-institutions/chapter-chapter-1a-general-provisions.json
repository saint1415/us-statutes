Any violation of this prohibition shall subject the party chargeable therewith to a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) for each day, with a maximum amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), during which such violation is committed or repeated. Such penalty may be recovered by the superintendent by an action instituted for that purpose, and, in addition to the penalty, such violation may be enjoined and the injunction enforced as in other cases.
