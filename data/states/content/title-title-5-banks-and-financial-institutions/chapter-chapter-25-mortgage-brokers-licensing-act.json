The supervisor shall consider all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation. Upon adoption of a regulation, the supervisor, if conflicting views are submitted on the proposed regulation and if requested in writing to do so by an interested person prior to adoption, shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption, incorporating therein its reasons for overruling any considerations urged against its adoption.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, if the supervisor finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires adoption of a regulation upon fewer than 35 days’ notice or that action is required by or to comply with a federal statute or regulation which requires adoption of a regulation upon fewer than 35 days’ notice and states in writing its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable, to adopt an emergency regulation. The regulation shall become effective immediately, unless otherwise stated therein. The regulation may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days unless within such time the supervisor complies with the procedures set forth in subdivision (1) and subdivision (2). The adoption of the same or a substantially similar regulation following the procedures set forth in subdivision (1) and subdivision (2) at any time is not limited by the adoption of a regulation following the emergency regulation procedure set forth in this subdivision.\n\n(4) Any regulation proposed by the department prior to May 31, 2004, that, in the majority judgment of the Speaker of the House, the Governor, and the Lieutenant Governor, unreasonably limits the ability of new licenses, shall not be effective until May 31, 2004.\n\n(5) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the department, other than rehearing, and who is aggrieved by a final decision of the supervisor with respect to a regulation, is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. All proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing of notice of appeal or review and a cost bond with the supervisor to cover the reasonable costs of preparing the transcript of the proceeding under review, unless waived by the supervisor or the court on a showing of substantial hardship. The notice of appeal and cost bond must be filed within 42 days after the date the supervisor issued its final regulation. The appeal shall be filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County. The regulation will be in effect pending the outcome of any appeal unless the supervisor stays the effective date of the regulation.\n\n(c) Interpretations, opinions, and approvals shall protect, to the extent provided in subsection (c), as applicable, both the licensee at whose request they were issued and any other licensee in a materially like circumstance.\n\n(Act 2001-692, p. 1439, §13.)",

In these actions, the hearing and appeal procedures provided for in those sections shall be the only procedures required under this chapter.\n\n(b) Notice of the department’s intention to enter an order denying an application for a license under this chapter or of an order suspending or revoking a license under this chapter shall be given to the applicant or licensee in writing, sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business of the applicant or licensee. Within 20 days of the date of the notice of intention to enter an order of denial, suspension, or revocation under this chapter, the applicant or licensee may request in writing a hearing to contest the order. If a hearing is not requested in writing within 20 days of the date of the notice of intention, the department shall enter a final order regarding the denial or suspension. Any final order of the department denying, suspending, or revoking a license shall state the grounds upon which it is based and shall be effective on the date of issuance. A copy of the final order shall be forwarded promptly by registered or certified mail addressed to the principal place of business of the applicant or licensee.\n\n(c) A decision of the department denying, suspending, or revoking a license shall be conclusive, except that a licensee aggrieved by an order of the department under this section may obtain judicial review of the order and the department may obtain an order of the court for enforcement of its order in the circuit court. The proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of Section 5-25-15.\n\n(d) A revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license shall not impair or affect the obligation of a preexisting contract between the licensee and another person entered into prior to the effective date of the license revocation, suspension, or surrender.\n\n(Act 2001-692, p. 1439, §14.)",

The department’s findings shall be prima facie correct, but the circuit court may hear such appeal according to its own rules and procedures, including the taking of additional testimony and staying the order. In the circuit court, the trial shall be de novo. The court may, if it decides that the department has erred to the prejudice of appellant’s substantial rights in its application of the law or that the order was based upon findings of fact contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence, remand the proceeding to the department for further action in conformity with the direction of the court or may enter such order as the court deems appropriate.\n\n(b) Either party may appeal from the circuit court to the Supreme Court of Alabama within 42 days from the date of entry of the order of the circuit court.\n\n(Act 2001-692, p. 1439, §15.)",
