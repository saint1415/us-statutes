The notice shall include a statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subject and issues involved, shall specify a notice period ending not less than 35 days nor more than 90 days from the date of the notice, during which period interested persons may present their views thereon, and shall specify the place where, and the manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon.\n\n(c) All interested persons shall have a reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in writing. The supervisor shall consider all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation. Upon adoption of a regulation, the supervisor, if conflicting views are submitted on the proposed regulation and if requested in writing to do so by an interested person prior to adoption, shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against its adoption, incorporating therein its reasons for overruling any considerations urged against its adoption.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, if the supervisor finds that action is required by or to comply with a federal statute or regulation which requires adoption of a regulation upon fewer than 35 days’ notice and states in writing his or her reasons for that finding, the supervisor may proceed without prior notice or hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that he or she finds practicable, to adopt an emergency regulation. The regulation shall become effective immediately, unless otherwise stated therein. The regulation may be effective for a period of not longer than 120 days unless within such time the supervisor complies with the procedures set forth in subsections (b) and (c). The adoption of the same or substantially similar regulation following the procedures set forth in subsections (b) and (c) at any time is not limited by the adoption of a regulation following the emergency regulation procedure set forth in this subsection.\n\n(e) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the department, other than rehearing, and who is aggrieved by the final decision of the supervisor with respect to a regulation, is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. All proceedings for a review shall be instituted by filing of notice of appeal or review and a cost bond with the supervisor to cover the reasonable costs of preparing the transcript of the proceeding under review, unless waived by the supervisor or the court on a showing of substantial hardship. The notice of appeal and cost bond shall be filed within 42 days after the date the supervisor issued the final regulation. The appeal shall be filed pursuant to Title 6. The regulation shall be in effect pending the outcome of any appeal unless the supervisor stays the effective date of regulations.\n\n(f) A licensee acting in reasonable reliance upon any written opinion or regulation promulgated by the supervisor or a decision of an appellate court of this state shall be presumed to have acted in accordance with applicable law, notwithstanding that after such act has occurred, the regulation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be incorrect or invalid for any reason or the particular judicial decision is reversed or modified.\n\n(Act 2003-359, p. 992, §10.)",

The maximum amount that may be advanced in any deferred presentment transaction is five hundred dollars ($500).\n\n(b) Each licensee may renew or extend a deferred presentment transaction with the same customer no more than one additional time at this fee for a maximum of two continuous transactions. After two continuous transactions with the customer, the licensee shall not enter into a new deferred presentment transaction with that same customer until the next business day after the transaction amount is repaid in full. After the customer has redeemed the check in full with cash or guaranteed funds, the licensee has the same authority as any other licensee to enter into another agreement for deferred presentment services with the customer on another check.\n\n(c) After the initial loan period and one rollover with the same customer, the full outstanding amount of the loan, including, but not limited to, held check or debt authorization, shall become due.

The customer in a deferred presentment contract shall have the right to redeem the check or debit authorization from the licensee before the agreed date of deposit upon payment to the licensee of the amount of the contract. A licensee shall not defer presentment of any personal check or debit authorization for less than 10 days nor more than 31 calendar days after the date of the contract.\n\n(d) The licensee shall notify the district attorney for the circuit in which the check was received within five business days after being advised by the payer financial institution that a check or draft has been altered, forged, stolen, obtained through fraudulent or illegal means, negotiated without proper legal authority, or represents the proceeds of illegal activity. If a check or draft is returned to the licensee by the payer financial institution for any of these reasons, the licensee shall not release the check, draft, or money order without the consent of the district attorney or other investigating law enforcement authority.\n\n(e) A licensee shall comply with all provisions of state and federal law regarding cash transactions and cash transaction reporting.\n\n(f) A licensee shall provide each prospective customer, before consummation of the deferred presentment agreement, with a written explanation in clear, understandable language of the fees to be charged by the licensee and the date on which the check or debit authorization may be deposited or presented by the licensee.

This subsection shall not create any inference that a particular method of disclosure was required prior to June 20, 2003.

The attorney’s fee may not exceed 15 percent of the face amount of the check or debit authorization. No individual who issues a personal check or authorizes a debit for his or her checking account to a licensee for the purpose of a deferred presentment transaction under this chapter shall be convicted pursuant to Section 13A-9-13.1, if the check or debit authorization is returned due to insufficient funds.
