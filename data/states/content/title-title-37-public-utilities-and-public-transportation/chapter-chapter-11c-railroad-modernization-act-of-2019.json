      "text": "Section 37-11C-3\n\nStandards for Approval of Qualified Railroad Rehabilitation Expenditures; Application for Tax Credits; Completion of Project; Tax Credit Certificate; Fees; Annual Report.\n\n(a) By December 1, 2019, the Department of Commerce shall develop standards for the approval of qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures for which a tax credit is being sought. The standards shall consider the availability of additional public or private funding for the project, the expected completion time of the project, and the anticipated impact of the project on usage of the railroad infrastructure.\n\n(b) By December 1, 2022, the Department of Revenue shall develop standards for the approval of qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures for which a tax credit is being sought. The standards shall consider the availability of additional public or private funding for the project, the expected completion time of the project, and the anticipated impact of the project on usage of the railroad infrastructure.\n\n(c) Prior to beginning any qualified railroad rehabilitation work, the eligible taxpayer shall submit an application and rehabilitation plan to the department and an estimate of the qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures under the rehabilitation plan; provided, however, the eligible taxpayer, at its own risk, may incur qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures no earlier than six months prior to the submission of the application and rehabilitation plan.\n\n(d) The department shall review the application and rehabilitation plan to determine if the information contained therein is complete. If the department determines that the application and rehabilitation plan are complete, the department shall reserve, for the benefit of the eligible taxpayer, an allocation for a tax credit as provided in this chapter and shall notify the eligible taxpayer in writing of the amount of the reservation. The reservation of tax credits does not entitle the taxpayer to an issuance of tax credits until the owner complies with all other requirements of this chapter for the issuance of the tax credits. Reservations of tax credits shall be issued by the department within a reasonable time from the filing of a completed application and rehabilitation plan. Any application disapproved by the department shall be removed from the review process, and the department shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the decision to remove the application. A disapproved application may be resubmitted, but shall be deemed to be a new submission and may be charged a new application fee. In the event the reservations of tax credits equal the total amount available for reservations during the tax year, all eligible taxpayers with applications then awaiting approval or thereafter submitted shall be notified by the department that no additional tax credits shall be granted during that tax year. The applications shall remain in active status from the date of the original application and shall be considered for recommendations of tax credits in the event that additional credits become available due to rescission by the department or when a new tax year’s allocation of tax credits becomes available.\n\n(e) Following the completion of a qualified railroad rehabilitation project, the eligible taxpayer shall notify the department that the rehabilitation has been completed and shall certify the qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures incurred with respect to the rehabilitation plan. Within 90 days after receipt and approval of the foregoing documentation from the eligible taxpayer, the department shall issue a tax credit certificate in an amount equivalent to the amount of the qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures incurred with respect to the rehabilitation plan as certified by the taxpayer, not to exceed the amount of the tax credit reservation issued for the project.\n\n(f) An eligible taxpayer that has been awarded the tax credit certificate may claim the credit against any state income tax due that is specified in this chapter against the taxpayer’s Alabama state tax return. All information submitted to the Department of Revenue by taxpayers claiming or seeking certification of a credit shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 40-2A-10.\n\n(g) For processing the taxpayer’s application for a tax credit, the department may impose an application fee equal to one percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures, not to exceed a fee equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000). Any fees collected by the department under this subsection shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the department and all such funds are to be appropriated to the department to defray the expenses incurred in carrying out this chapter.\n\n(h) The department shall report to the Legislature in the third year following passage of this chapter, and annually thereafter, on the overall economic activity, usage, and impact to the state from the rehabilitation of railroad infrastructure for which tax credits have been allowed. The information in the reports shall be consistent with the information required by the Legislature pursuant to, and shall be provided by the department to the Legislature in accordance with Section 40-1-50, and rules adopted thereunder. Information provided pursuant to this section is exempt from the confidentiality provisions of Section 40-2A-10.\n\n(Act 2019-459, §3; Act 2022-341, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 37-11C-4\n\nAllowance and Claim of Tax Credits; Railroad Rehabilitation Income Tax Credit Account; Written Transfer Agreements.\n\n(a) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2022, there is a credit allowed against the state income tax levied by Section 40-18-2 equal to 50 percent of an eligible taxpayer’s qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures. The tax credit allowed under this section may not exceed three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased within the state by the eligible taxpayer at the close of the taxable year.\n\n(b) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, through December 31, 2027, there is a credit allowed against the state income tax levied by Section 40-18-2 equal to 50 percent of an eligible taxpayer’s qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures. The tax credit allowed under this section may not exceed four thousand one hundred dollars ($4,100) multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased within the state by the eligible taxpayer at the close of the taxable year.\n\n(c) There is created within the Education Trust Fund a separate account named the Railroad Rehabilitation Income Tax Credit Account. The Commissioner of Revenue shall certify to the state Comptroller the amount of income tax credits under this section, and the state Comptroller shall transfer into the Railroad Rehabilitation Income Tax Credit Account only the amount from sales tax revenues within the Education Trust Fund that is sufficient for the Department of Revenue to use to cover the income tax credits for the applicable tax year. The commissioner shall distribute the funds in the Railroad Rehabilitation Income Tax Credit Account pursuant to this section.\n\n(d) The entire tax credit may be claimed by the taxpayer in the taxable year in which the qualified railroad rehabilitation expenditures are completed and placed into service. Where the taxes owed by the eligible taxpayer are less than the tax credit, the eligible taxpayer may be entitled to claim a refund for the difference.\n\n(e) For the calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the aggregate amount of all tax credits that may be reserved in any one of such years by the department upon certification of rehabilitation plans shall not exceed three million seven hundred thousand dollars ($3,700,000) plus any amount of previous reservations of tax credits that were rescinded during the tax year. However, if all of the allowable tax credit amount for any tax year is not requested and reserved, any unreserved tax credits may be utilized by the department in awarding tax credits in subsequent years; provided, however, that in no event shall a total of more than eleven million one hundred thousand dollars ($11,100,000) be reserved by the department during the period of August 1, 2019 through August 1, 2022. For purposes of this chapter, “tax year” shall mean the calendar year.\n\n(f) For the calendar years 2023 through 2027, the aggregate amount of all tax credits that may be reserved in any one of such years by the department upon certification of rehabilitation plans shall not exceed four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) plus any amount of previous reservations of tax credits that were rescinded during the tax year. However, if all of the allowable tax credit amount for any tax year is not requested and reserved, any unreserved tax credits may be utilized by the department in awarding tax credits in subsequent years; provided, however, that in no event shall a total of more than twenty-two million five hundred thousand dollars ($22,500,000) be reserved by the department during the period of August 1, 2022, through August 1, 2027. For the purposes of this chapter “tax year” shall mean the calendar year.\n\n(g) Tax credits granted to a partnership, a limited liability company, S Corporations, trusts, or estates shall be claimed at the entity level and shall not pass through to the partners, members, or owners.\n\n(h) All or any portion of the income tax credit authorized under this section may be transferable and assignable by written transfer agreement and subject to any notice and verification requirements to be determined by the Department of Revenue. Any tax credits transferred shall be at a value of at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the present value of the credits. However, once a credit is transferred, only the transferee may utilize the credit and the credit may not be transferred again. An eligible transferee of the credit may use the amount of credits transferred to offset any income tax due under Chapter 18 of Title 40. The department, by rule, shall adopt a written transfer agreement form. The transfer statement form shall include the name and federal taxpayer identification number of the transferor and each transferee listed therein along with the amount of the tax credit to be transferred to each transferee listed on the form. The transfer statement form shall also contain such other information as the department may from time to time reasonably require. For each transfer, the transferor shall file with the department; (1) a completed transfer statement form; (2) a copy of the executed written transfer agreement; and (3) a transfer fee payable to the department in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per transferee listed on the transfer statement form. Within 30 days after the department’s receipt of the fully executed written transfer agreement, the department shall issue a tax credit certificate to each transferee listed in the agreement in the amount of the tax credit so transferred. Such certificate shall be used by the transferee in claiming the tax credit. The department may adopt such additional rules as are necessary to permit verification of the ownership of the tax credits but shall not adopt any rules that unduly restrict or hinder the transfer of the tax credits.\n\n(Act 2019-459, §4; Act 2021-177, §1(b)(3); Act 2022-341, §1.)",
