This chapter does not limit any person’s right to pursue any additional civil remedy otherwise allowed by law.\n\n(h) No civil penalty may be imposed pursuant to this section against an excavator or operator who violates any provision of this chapter if the violation occurred while the excavator or operator was responding to an emergency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the civil penalty shall be imposed if the violation was willful or malicious.\n\n(i) This section shall not be construed to limit any provision of law granting governmental immunity to state or local entities or to impose any liability or duty of care not otherwise imposed by law upon any state or local entity.\n\n(j) Any person who willfully or maliciously removes or otherwise destroys a marking used by an operator to mark the location of any underground facility, except in the ordinary course of excavation, is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.\n\n(k) Any monies received by the Underground Damage Prevention Authority prior to April 22, 2021, which were directed to be paid into the Underground Damage Prevention Fund shall be deposited into the fund.\n\n(Acts 1994, No. 94-487, p. 911, §10; Act 2014-220, p. 691, §1; Act 2019-407, §1; Act 2021-273, §§1,2.)",
