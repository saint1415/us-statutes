Any such rule or regulation promulgated under the chapter shall be adopted pursuant to a determination by the commission, supported by substantial evidence, that such rule or regulation is in the public interest and shall be just and reasonable to the electric consumers of any electric utility affected. Any cogenerator or electric utility may petition the commission for appropriate relief under this chapter, and the commission will act on any such petition within 180 days. Any cogenerator or electric utility may petition the commission for approval of a contract between them, which approval will be granted within 60 days of such petition unless the contract is clearly contrary to the policy and purposes of this chapter or is otherwise unlawful. Payments required to be made by a utility to a cogenerator pursuant to any contract approved under this chapter, or pursuant to other relief afforded under this chapter, shall be afforded appropriate treatment by the commission to assure full and expedient recovery in the rates charged by the utility which are subject to the commission’s jurisdiction. If the commission action on any petition is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, or is otherwise unlawful, the petitioner or any party to the proceedings may bring an action within 30 days after the date of the commission order or the expiration of the applicable 60 or 180-day period, in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, to seek appropriate relief consistent with the policy, purposes and provisions of this chapter.\n\n(Acts 1983, No. 83-574, p. 880, §4.)",
