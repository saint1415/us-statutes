Select or recommend routes and locations, perform preliminary engineering and surveying, acquire necessary rights-of-way and property, perform site improvements, and otherwise plan, develop, construct, and own a rail line, or portion thereof, that connects to the rail line of a railroad corporation.\n\nb. Take any action described in subdivision (1) for the purpose of assisting a railroad corporation or other entity in developing, constructing, improving, and owning a rail line, or portion thereof, for any other purpose as approved by ADECA that promotes economic development associated with rail infrastructure or passenger or freight rail service.\n\n(2) The actions undertaken pursuant to this subsection shall be accomplished using all the authority and powers granted to ADECA with the assistance of the commission and as applicable, by agreement with the railroad corporation to which the state-owned rail line connects or as described in any memorandum of understanding between ADECA or with the commission, or both, and the railroad corporation. ADECA and the commission, acting jointly, may enter into an agreement with a connecting railroad corporation for the lease or sale of the rail line for commercial operations on terms and conditions and with safeguards that will promote and protect the public interest. ADECA and the commission, acting jointly, may transfer possession or title to state-owned rail line and rights-of-way by deed, lease, contract, or other legal instrument. Funds for any state-owned rail line projects may be provided as appropriated by the Legislature. While owned by ADECA or any other department, agency, or instrumentality of the state or by the commission the easements and property acquired for use by a rail line may be crossed by governmental entities and public utilities with roads and utility facilities subject to compliance with appropriate safety standards.\n\n(b) At the end of the lease term, ADECA and the commission, acting jointly, shall sell the state-owned rail line to the connecting railroad for a purchase price that, when combined with the total amount of lease payments, made before the sale, shall be an amount which is not less than the proceeds of the appropriation issued to fund the project. All lease payments shall be deposited into the Railroad Revitalization Fund established in Section 37-11B-6.\n\n(c) If ADECA and the commission, acting jointly, take any of the actions authorized in subsection (a) and enter into an agreement for the sale of a state-owned rail line, the terms of the sale agreement shall include a purchase price that shall be in an amount not less than the amount appropriated by the Legislature to accomplish the project. The purchase price payment shall be deposited into the Railroad Revitalization Fund established in Section 37-11B-6.\n\n(d) Contracts for the lease or sale of the rail line may be negotiated and executed without the necessity of advertising and obtaining competitive bids.\n\n(Act 2009-787, p. 2472, §5.)",

Monies, including interest earnings, in this fund shall be expended either separately or in combination with any available federal funds for railroad research, railroad planning, and railroad administration costs incurred by ADECA directly attributable to railroad revitalization projects; assistance to railroads for the rehabilitation or improvement of rail lines; and construction, improvement, or rehabilitation of railroad facilities.\n\n(b) ADECA with the assistance of the commission, in conjunction with the railroads operating in the State of Alabama, shall develop the State Rail Plan, which shall be a comprehensive plan that coordinates all aspects of the improvements to rail infrastructure within the state and includes distinct freight and passenger components, as described in subdivisions (3) and (4) of Section 37-11B-3. During fiscal years 2010 and 2011, a total cumulative sum not to exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of the Railroad Revitalization Fund shall be used specifically for the purpose of initially developing the State Rail Plan. After the initial development of the State Rail Plan, the plan shall be updated periodically, not less than every three years.\n\n(c) Except as may be otherwise provided in Sections 37-11B-1 to 37-11B-5, inclusive, funds appropriated or otherwise provided by the Legislature for rail line assistance as described in subsections (a) and (b) shall be deposited in the Railroad Revitalization Fund.
