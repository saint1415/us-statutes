If at the time of the election of any directors there shall be in existence in a party state any person, firm, or entity that makes use of the railroad properties and facilities owned or to be acquired by the authority, the governing body located in the party state shall elect as such directors the representative or representatives of the person, firm, or entity as designated thereby.

The board shall hold regular and special meetings as its business may require and as the board may determine. Any meeting of the board may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the members present. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. No vacancy in the membership of the board shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all powers and duties of the authority.

The board shall establish the location of the principal office of the authority, which shall be in one of the counties named in Article I. The officers of the authority shall consist of a chair, a vice-chair, a secretary, a treasurer, and such other officers as the board shall deem necessary.

No bonds or notes issued or contracts entered into by the authority shall ever constitute or create an obligation or debt of any party state, or of any county, city, or town within any party state, or a charge against the credit or taxing powers of any party state, or of any county, city, or town within any party state.\n\nBonds of the authority may be issued at any time and from time to time; may be in such form, either in bearer form with appurtenant coupons, and subject to registration as to principal or interest, or both, all as the board may determine, or in fully registered form without coupons, and in such denominations, may be of such tenor, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times, not exceeding 40 years from their date; may be payable at such place or places whether within or without any party state; may bear interest at such rate or rates, which may be fixed or which may float or vary based on some index or other standard deemed appropriate by the board; and shall be payable and evidenced in such manner, all as shall not be inconsistent with this compact and as may be provided in the proceedings of the board wherein the bonds are authorized to be issued. Any bond may be made subject to redemption at the option of the authority at such time or times, and at such price or prices, and upon such notice or notices, and on such terms, and in such manner as may be provided in the proceedings of the board wherein the bonds are authorized to be issued. Bonds of the authority may be sold at public or private sale in the manner and from time to time as may be determined by the board. The authority may pay all reasonable expenses, premiums, fees, and commissions that the board may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale, and issuance of its bonds. All bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this compact, which recital shall be conclusive that they have been duly authorized pursuant to this compact. Neither a public hearing nor the consent of any agency of any party state or any political subdivision thereof shall be prerequisite to the issuance of bonds by the authority. All bonds issued under this compact are hereby made and shall be deemed negotiable instruments.\n\nAll bonds shall be signed, either manually or by facsimile, by the chair or the vice-chair and the secretary or the treasurer of the authority and the seal of the authority shall be affixed, either manually or by facsimile, thereto. Delivery of bonds so executed shall be valid notwithstanding any changes in the officers or in the seal of the authority after the signing and sealing of the bonds.\n\nAny bonds may be issued under and secured by an indenture between the authority and a trustee. The trustee may be a private person or corporation, including but not limited to, any trust company or bank having trust powers, whether the bank or trust company is located within or without any party state. In any indenture or resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, the authority may pledge, for payment of the principal of and the interest on bonds, any of its revenues to which its right then exists or may thereafter come into existence and may assign, as security for the payment, any of its leases, franchises, permits and contracts; and in any indenture, the authority may mortgage or grant security interests in any of its properties, including any that may be thereafter acquired by it. Any pledge of revenues shall be valid and binding from the time it is made and the revenues so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately become subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether the parties have actual notice thereof, from the time a statement is filed for record in each county in which is located any part of the property the revenues from which are so pledged. The notice need state only the date on which the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds was adopted by the board, the principal amount of bonds issued, a brief description of the revenues pledged, and a brief description of any property the revenues from which are pledged.\n\nIn any indenture or resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds and pledging for the benefit thereof revenues from any of its railroad properties and facilities, the authority shall have the power to include provisions customarily contained in instruments securing evidence of indebtedness, including without limitation, provisions respecting the collection, segregation, and application of any rental or other revenue due to or to become due to the authority, the terms to be incorporated in any lease agreement respecting any property of the authority, the maintenance and insurance of any building or structure owned by the authority, the creation and maintenance of special funds from any revenue of the authority, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the holders of the bonds or the trustee under the indenture, all as the board shall deem advisable. If there be any default by the authority in payment of the principal of or the interest on the bonds, or in any of the agreements on the part of the authority that may properly be included in any indenture securing the bonds, any holder of bonds, or the trustee under any indenture if authorized in the indenture, may, in addition to any other remedies herein provided or otherwise available, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, enforce payment of such principal or interest and compel performance of all duties of the board and officers of the authority, and shall be entitled as a matter of right, and regardless of the sufficiency of any security, to the appointment of a receiver in equity with all the powers of the receiver for the operation and maintenance of the property of the authority covered by the indenture and the collection, segregation, and application of revenues therefrom. The indenture may also contain provisions restricting the individual rights of action of the holders of the bonds.\n\nThe proceeds derived from the sale of any bonds, other than refunding bonds, may be used only to pay the costs of acquiring, constructing, improving, enlarging, equipping, and operating the railroad properties and facilities, or other property with respect to which the bonds were issued, as may be specified in the proceedings in which the bonds are authorized to be issued. The costs shall be deemed to include the following: (1) the costs of any land or easements forming a part of the railroad properties and facilities or other property; (2) the cost of labor, material, and supplies used in any construction, improvement, or enlargement, including architects’ and engineers’ fees, and the cost of preparing contract documents and advertising for bids; (3) the purchase price of, and the cost of installing equipment for use in connection with, the railroad properties and facilities or other property; (4) the cost of constructing and installing roads, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, utilities, and parking places in connection with the railroad properties and facilities or other property; (5) the amounts of any debt service, maintenance, and capital improvement and other similar reserves deemed advisable; (6) legal, fiscal, credit enhancement or insurance, and recording fees, premiums, and expenses incurred in connection with the authorization, sale, and issuance of the bonds issued in connection with the railroad properties and facilities or other property; (7) interest on said bonds for a reasonable period prior to and during the time required for such construction, improvement, enlargement, and equipment and for not to exceed 18 months after completion thereof. If any of the proceeds derived from the sale of the bonds remains undisbursed after completion of the work and payment of all of the costs and expenses, the balance shall be used for retirement of the principal of the bonds of the same issue.\n\nThe authority may, at any time and from time to time, issue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding the principal of and the interest on any bonds of the authority theretofore issued hereunder and then outstanding, whether or not the principal and interest has matured at the time of the refunding, and for the payment of any expenses incurred in connection with the refunding and any premium necessary to be paid in order to redeem, retire, or purchase for retirement the bonds to be refunded. The proceeds derived from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be used only for the purposes for which the refunding bonds were authorized to be issued. Any refunding may be effected either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof, or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby. All provisions of this compact pertaining to bonds of the authority that are not inconsistent with this paragraph shall, to the extent applicable, also apply to refunding bonds issued by the authority. The authority may, at any time and from time to time, issue bonds for the purpose of refunding the principal of and the interest on any of its bonds and for any other purpose for which it is authorized to issue bonds, in which event the provisions hereof respecting refunding bonds shall apply only to that portion of the combined issue authorized for refunding purposes and the provisions hereof respecting other financing shall apply to the remaining portion of such combined issue.\n\nThe authority may, in addition to the other powers granted herein, borrow money for use for any corporate purpose described herein and, in evidence of such borrowing, issue from time to time revenue notes maturing not later than 18 months from the date of issuance and bearing such rate or rates of interest as the board may provide in the proceedings when the revenue notes are authorized to be issued. The notes may be payable from the principal proceeds from the sale of bonds or, to the extent necessary, from any revenues of the authority which may be pledged to the payment of its bonds, or both, and the notes may be secured by a pledge of so much as may be necessary therefor of such revenues. Any notes may be refunded, or renewed, or extended for additional periods of not more than 18 months each from the date of maturity of the notes being refunded, or renewed, or extended, but otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. The notes may be sold either at public or private sale as the board may determine. All provisions of this compact pertaining to bonds of the authority that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph shall, to the extent applicable, also apply to notes issued by the authority.\n\nThe governing body of any county, city, or town within any party state may invest in bonds of the authority any money held in its treasury. Bonds issued under this compact shall be legal investments for executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries, unless otherwise directed by the court having jurisdiction of the fiduciary relation, or by the document that is the source of the fiduciary’s authority. The bonds shall be legal investments for savings banks and insurance companies organized under the laws of any party state.\n\nThe directors and officers of the authority shall not be subject to any personal liability by reason of the issuance of any bonds or notes of the authority.\n\nArticle IX.\n\nThe authority and all contracts made by it shall be exempt from (a) all laws (1) relating to the advertising and award of construction contracts and purchase contracts and (2) limiting the duration of or requiring competitive bids in connection with any contract to be entered into by any municipality, county, public corporation, or other instrumentality; and (b) from all laws relating to or governing usury or prescribing or limiting interest rates. The authority and its contracts and properties shall be exempt from all jurisdiction of and all regulation and supervision by the public service commission or other successor or similar agency of any party state.\n\nAll bonds or notes issued by the authority, the transfer thereof, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation by each party state and any political subdivision of any thereof. The authority and all property and income of the authority shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal, and other local taxation, and from any assessment for public improvements. The exemption shall not be construed to exempt concessionaires, licensees, tenants, operators, or lessees of the authority from the payment of any taxes, including licenses or privilege taxes levied by any party state or any county or any municipality in any party state. All documents or instruments of whatever nature or content to which the authority is a party shall be filed for record in any county in any party state without the payment of any tax or fee other than such fee as may be authorized by law for the recording of such documents and instruments. The authority shall be exempt from all income, privilege, license, or excise taxes levied by any party state or any county, city, town, or other political subdivision thereof in respect to the income, revenue, or profits of the authority, or the privilege of engaging in any of the activities or powers in which the authority may engage or which the authority may exercise. The authority shall be exempt from all privilege, license, or excise taxes levied by any party state or any county, city, town, or other political subdivision thereof with respect to tangible personal property purchased or used by the authority.\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other railroad project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.\n\nArticle XI.\n\nThis compact shall continue in full force and remain binding upon each party state. At any time when the authority does not have any bonds, notes, or other obligations outstanding, including without limitation any leases under which the authority is either lessor or lessee, the legislature of each or either party state may take action to withdraw from this compact; provided, that such withdrawal shall not become effective until six months after the date of the action taken by the legislature. Notice of such action shall be given to the other party state and the authority by the secretary of state of the party state which takes such action. Upon withdrawal of a party state from this compact becoming effective as to such party state, the authority shall cease to exist and all rights, title, and interest of the authority in property located in the State of Alabama shall be vested in the City of Red Bay, Alabama, and all rights, title, and interest of the authority in property located in the State of Mississippi shall be vested in the Town of Belmont, Mississippi.\n\nArticle XII.\n\nThe authority shall be a nonprofit corporation and no part of its net earnings remaining after payment of its expenses shall inure to the benefit of any person, except that in the event the board determines that sufficient provision has been made for the full payment of the expenses, bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority, any net earnings of the authority thereafter accruing shall be equally divided between the Town of Belmont, Mississippi, and the City of Red Bay, Alabama.\n\nArticle XIII.\n\nThere is hereby granted to the Governor, to the members of the board of the authority for Alabama, and to any executives or administrators of this compact all powers provided for in the compact. All officers of the State of Alabama are hereby authorized and directed to do all things falling within their respective jurisdictions which are necessary or incidental to carrying out the purposes of this compact.\n\nArticle XIV.\n\nThe provisions of this compact are severable. If any part of this compact is declared invalid or unconstitutional, such declaration shall not affect the remaining parts.\n\n(Acts 1992, 2nd Ex. Sess., No. 92-707, §1.)",
