Failing such election for a period of more than 30 days, such successor shall, upon the request of the governing body of any authorizing subdivision, be appointed by the governor of the state.

No vacancy in the membership of the board shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the powers and duties of the authority. The board shall hold regular meetings on the second Tuesday in each month and at such other times as may be provided in the bylaws of the authority; and the board may hold other meetings at any time and from time to time, provided that upon call of the chairman of the authority or any two directors, a special meeting of the board must be held. Any matter on which the board is authorized to act may be acted upon at any regular, special or called meeting. At the request of any director, the vote on any question before the board shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered upon the record. All proceedings of the board shall be reduced to writing by the secretary of the authority, recorded in a well bound book and open to each director and to the public at all reasonable times. Copies of such proceedings, when certified by the secretary of the authority under its seal, shall be received in all courts as evidence of the matters and things therein certified.\n\nDirectors shall receive no compensation for their services as directors; however, each director may be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred by him in and about the performance of his duties.

Any such pledge of revenues shall be valid and binding from the time it is made, and the revenues so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately become subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether the parties have actual notice thereof, from the time a statement is filed in the office of the judge of probate of the county in which is located the principal office of the authority (as specified in its certificate of incorporation) and any other county in which any part of the property, the revenues from which are so pledged, is located. Such notice need state only the date on which the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds was adopted by the board, the principal amount of bonds issued, a brief description of the revenues so pledged and a brief description of any property the revenues from which are so pledged.\n\nIn any indenture or resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds and pledging for the benefit thereof revenues from any of its railroad properties and facilities, the authority shall have the power to include provisions customarily contained in instruments securing evidence of indebtedness, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions respecting the collection, segregation and application of any rental or other revenue due to or to become due to the authority, the terms to be incorporated in any lease agreement respecting any property of the authority, the maintenance and insurance of any building or structure owned by the authority, the creation and maintenance of special funds from any revenue of the authority and the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the holders of the bonds or the trustee under the indenture, all as the board shall deem advisable and as shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. If there be any default by the authority in payment of the principal of or the interest on the bonds or in any of the agreements on the part of the authority that may properly be included in any indenture securing the bonds, any holder of bonds or coupons, or the trustee under any indenture if so authorized in such indenture, may (in addition to any other remedies herein provided or otherwise available) either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce payment of such principal or interest and compel performance of all duties of the board and officers of the authority, and shall be entitled as a matter of right, and regardless of the sufficiency of any such security, to the appointment of a receiver in equity with all the powers of such receiver for the operation and maintenance of the property of the authority covered by such indenture and the collection, segregation and application of revenues therefrom. The indenture may also contain provisions restricting the individual rights of action of the holders of the bonds and coupons.\n\n(Acts 1984, No. 84-179, p. 256, §13.)",
