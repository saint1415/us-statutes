      "text": "of policy.(1) In order to provide the citizens of the state with adequate and reliable electric service at as low overall cost as possible, consistent with sound business practices, it is the policy of this state to avoid and eliminate conflict and competition between public power districts, public power and irrigation districts, individual municipalities, registered groups of municipalities, electric membership associations, and cooperatives in furnishing electric energy to retail and wholesale customers, to avoid and eliminate the duplication of facilities and resources which result therefrom, and to facilitate the settlement of rate disputes between suppliers of electricity.(2) It is also the policy of the state to prepare for an evolving retail electricity market if certain conditions are met which indicate that retail competition is in the best interests of the citizens of the state. The determination on the timing and form of competitive markets is a matter properly left to the states as each state must evaluate the costs and benefits of a competitive retail market based on its own unique conditions. Consequently, there is a need for the state to monitor whether the conditions necessary for its citizens to benefit from retail competition exist.(3) It is also the policy of the state to encourage and allow opportunities for private developers to develop, own, and operate renewable energy facilities intended for sale at wholesale under a statutory framework which protects the ratepayers of consumer-owned utility systems operating in the state from subsidizing the costs of such export facilities through their rates.SourceLaws 1963, c. 397, § 1, p. 1259;Laws 1971, LB 349, § 4;Laws 1981, LB 181, § 42;Laws 2000, LB 901, § 6;Laws 2010, LB1048, § 2;Laws 2016, LB824, § 2;Laws 2023, LB565, § 43.AnnotationsPublic policy underlying encouragement of publicly owned electric utilities is to provide power to consumers at reasonable rates at as low overall cost as possible and to avoid duplication of facilities.
