      "text": "Section 14-10-1\n\nFurnishing of Clothing and Transportation to State Inmate Requiring Same at Expiration of Term; Rules and Regulations; Documentation for Identification; Waiver.\n\nTHIS SECTION WAS AMENDED BY ACT 2021-549 IN THE 2021 1ST SPECIAL SESSION, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2021. THIS IS NOT IN THE CURRENT CODE SUPPLEMENT.\n\n(a) The Department of Corrections shall adopt reasonable rules and criteria to determine those state inmates who require clothing and transportation upon the expiration of their term of custody and before the expiration of their term of custody for each state inmate shall make a reasonable determination of whether or not the state inmate has ready and immediate access to clothing and transportation that meet the requirements of this section. Each state inmate who is determined to require clothing and transportation, at the expiration of his or her term of custody, shall be discharged from the custody and shall be furnished with clothes and with the least expensive mode of public transportation to the point where the inmate is to report for parole and probation supervision, or to the point of sentencing, to be paid from the Department of Corrections general operating funds. Clothing shall be of decent and reasonable quality for employment.\n\n(b) The Department of Corrections shall provide minimum documentation for identification, including a social security card and a birth certificate, necessary to obtain employment. The Department of Corrections, in conjunction with the Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency, shall assist an inmate in obtaining a non-driver identification card, as required in Section 41-27-3.2.\n\n(c) Any inmate entitled to clothing and transportation may waive the same, in which case the Department of Corrections shall not be required to make any payment in lieu of clothing and transportation. Each state inmate shall receive this clothing and transportation allowance only once per offense and multiple offenses being served consecutively or concurrently shall for this purpose be considered one offense; but the Department of Corrections may at its discretion furnish transportation as noted above upon any discharge. If the inmate is charged with the commission of any other criminal offense, he or she must be delivered to the proper sheriff or officer to answer the charge.\n\nCode 1852, §351; Code 1867, §3899; Code 1876, §4597; Code 1886, §4635; Code 1896, §4500; Code 1907, §6554; Code 1923, §3650; Code 1940, T. 45, §54; Acts 1953, No. 746, p. 1008; Acts 1973, No. 1116, p. 1878; Acts 1989, No. 89-642, p. 1270, §1; Act 2021-549, §2.)",

Said additional allowances and payments may be made as cash allowances and payments are made under existing laws. The Department of Corrections shall determine those state inmates who require these payments and shall use the regulations and criteria established in accordance with Section 14-10-1 to make this determination. No payment shall be made to any state inmate whom the Department of Corrections has reasonably determined does not require such payment. Any state inmate may waive receipt of this payment.
