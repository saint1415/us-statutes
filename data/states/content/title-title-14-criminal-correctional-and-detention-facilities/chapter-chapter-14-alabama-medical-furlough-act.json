The commissioner shall adopt the rules and regulations for implementation of the medical furlough program. For each person considered for medical furlough, the commissioner shall determine whether the person is a geriatric inmate, permanently incapacitated inmate, or terminally ill inmate.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an inmate who has not served his or her minimum sentence shall be considered eligible for consideration for furlough under this chapter.\n\n(c) This chapter shall not apply to inmates convicted of capital murder or a sexual offense.\n\n(d) Medical furlough consideration shall be in addition to any other release for which an inmate may be eligible.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall determine the conditions of release of any inmate pursuant to this chapter, including the appropriate level of supervision of the inmate, and shall develop a discharge plan for each inmate released under this chapter. Prior to the commissioner granting any release based on the appropriate medical documentation pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 14-14-5, employees of the department shall contact appropriate departments and agencies, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the Department of Public Health, the Department of Human Resources, Medicare, Medicaid, hospice organizations, or other public and nonprofit community service agencies as the commissioner may deem necessary for consultation in developing an appropriate discharge plan, and to confirm that required care and resources are available to meet the inmate’s needs. This chapter is not intended to expand or create new responsibilities for public agencies for arranging and providing care.\n\n(f) In considering an inmate for medical furlough, the department may request that additional medical evidence be produced, or that additional medical examinations be conducted.\n\n(g) Except as provided herein, the furlough of an inmate on medical furlough shall be for the remainder of the inmate’s sentence. In addition to terms and conditions prescribed by the department, supervision of an inmate on medical furlough shall at a minimum consist of biannual medical evaluations by a medical care provider at intervals to be determined by the commissioner at the time of release.\n\n(h) If the medical condition of an inmate released pursuant to this chapter should improve to the extent that he or she no longer meets the criteria by which he or she was released, or if he or she violates a condition of release or becomes a danger to himself or herself or others, the commissioner shall revoke the furlough.\n\n(i) The commissioner shall report annually to the Joint Legislative Interim Prison Committee, House Judiciary Sentencing Commission Subcommittee, and the Alabama Sentencing Commission on the number of applications for medical furlough, the nature of the illnesses, diseases, and conditions of the applicants, the number of inmates granted and denied release, and the number of persons on medical furlough who have been returned to the custody of the department. The commissioner shall further report on the status of all inmates who meet the criteria for medical furlough as defined in Section 14-14-2. This report shall include those individuals who have spent more than 30 calendar days within the prior 12 month time period in an infirmary or under direct medical supervision for the medical condition associated with the furlough request or its comorbidities. The report shall be made in a manner that does not disclose any individual identifying information for any particular inmate and shall be compliant in all respects with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\n(Act 2008-550, p. 1193, §4; Act 2015-185, §3.)",

These reports shall each be of the opinion that the inmate is either terminally ill, permanently incapacitated, or that the inmate suffers from a chronic infirmity, illness, or disease related to aging.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall provide the initial application and medical authorization forms to all department medical care providers, and the forms shall be available at every correctional facility for distribution to inmates.\n\n(c) Consideration for medical furlough shall be initiated by the submission of an application from the department, the inmate, or the inmate’s representative, along with the department’s supporting documentation to the commissioner.\n\n(d) If the appropriate medical documentation pursuant to subsection (b) has indicated that the inmate is permanently incapacitated or terminally ill, the commissioner, within 60 days of receipt of an initial application form, shall make a decision regarding the release of the inmate on medical furlough pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The initial application form and supporting document of inmates, who have been diagnosed by a physician as suffering from a chronic illness or disease related to aging, shall be submitted to the commissioner within 60 days of receipt of the application by the department. Supporting documentation shall include information concerning the inmate’s medical history and prognosis, age, and institutional behavior. At the inmate’s request, the department shall also provide a copy of all supporting documentation to the inmate.\n\n(e) In determining eligibility factors for a medical furlough, the commissioner shall take into consideration all of the following factors:\n\n(1) Risk for violence.\n\n(2) Criminal history.\n\n(3) Institutional behavior.\n\n(4) Age of the inmate, currently and at the time of the offense.\n\n(5) Severity of the illness, disease, or infirmities.\n\n(6) All available medical and mental health records.\n\n(7) Release plans, which include alternatives to caring for terminally ill or permanently incapacitated inmates in traditional prison settings.\n\n(f) If the commissioner determines that a geriatric inmate, permanently incapacitated inmate, or terminally ill inmate meets the requirements for release to medical furlough pursuant to this chapter, the commissioner shall release the inmate on medical furlough pursuant to the provisions of this chapter within 90 days of receipt by the commissioner of the initial application form and supporting documentation. The commissioner shall have the authority to revoke the inmate’s furlough pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 14-14-4.\n\n(g) At least 30 days prior to release of a geriatric inmate, permanently incapacitated inmate, or terminally ill inmate under subsection (f), the commissioner shall provide notification of the medical furlough release to the district attorney of the jurisdiction where the inmate was last sentenced and shall also provide notification of the medical furlough release to the victim, victim’s representative, and other interested individual via certified mail, return receipt requested, or by using the automated victim notification system as provided in Section 15-22-36 and Section 15-22-36.2.\n\n(Act 2008-550, p. 1193, §5; Act 2015-185, §3.)",
