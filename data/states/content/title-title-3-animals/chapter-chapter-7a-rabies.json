Notwithstanding the above, the State Board of Health may establish by rule vaccine intervals or specific vaccines, or both, to be used in public rabies vaccination clinics, based on considerations such as county specific prevalence of animal rabies or risk of animal rabies and the vaccination rates of dogs, cats, and ferrets in a county. Evidence of immunization shall consist of a printed certificate furnished by the Alabama Department of Public Health, upon which shall be legibly inscribed: A description of the animal; its age, color, sex, breed, and tattoo identification, if any; the name and address of the owner; the lot number and type of vaccine used (modified live virus, inactivated virus); the name of the manufacturer, the amount of vaccine injected, and the date after which the animal is no longer considered vaccinated; and a serially numbered tag bearing the same number and year as that of the certificate.

Certificates not complying with the provisions of this section, or certificates issued by those persons unauthorized to administer rabies vaccine, shall not be valid. In lieu of printed certificates, licensed veterinarians may elect to utilize electronically generated and maintained certificates if the certificates contain substantially the same information as required above. A signed paper copy of the certificate prescribed herein shall be delivered to the owner of the animal immunized. A paper copy or electronic copy or evidence thereof shall be maintained by the licensed veterinarian for a period of one year past the expiration date of a certificate.
