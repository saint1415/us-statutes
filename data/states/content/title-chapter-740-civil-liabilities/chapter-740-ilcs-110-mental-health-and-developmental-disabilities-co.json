The HIE participants shall permit a recipient to revoke a prior decision to opt-out or a decision not to opt-out. These rules, standards, or contractual obligations shall provide for written notice of a recipient's right to opt-out which directs the recipient to a health information exchange website containing (i) an explanation of the purposes of the health information exchange; and (ii) audio, visual, and written instructions on how to opt-out of participation in whole or in part to the extent possible. The process for effectuating an opt-out shall be reviewed by the HIE participants annually and updated as the technical options develop. The recipient shall be provided meaningful disclosure regarding the health information exchange, and the recipient's decision whether to opt-out should be obtained without undue inducement or any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, or other form of constraint or coercion. To the extent that HIPAA, as specified in 45 CFR 164.508(b)(4), prohibits a covered entity from conditioning the provision of its services upon an individual's provision of an authorization, an HIE participant shall not condition the provision of its services upon a recipient's decision to opt-out of further disclosure of the record by an HIE to third parties. The HIE participants shall also give annual consideration to enable a recipient to expressly decline the further disclosure by an HIE to third parties of selected portions of the recipient's record while permitting disclosure of the recipient's remaining patient health information. In giving effect to recipient disclosure preferences, the HIE participants may consider the extent to which relevant health information technologies reasonably available to therapists and HIEs in this State reasonably enable the effective segmentation of specific information within a recipient's electronic medical record and reasonably enable the effective exclusion of specific information from disclosure by an HIE to third parties, as well as the availability of sufficient authoritative clinical guidance to enable the practical application of such technologies to effect recipient disclosure preferences.
