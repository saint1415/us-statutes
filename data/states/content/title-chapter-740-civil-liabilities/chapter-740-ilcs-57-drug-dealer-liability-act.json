These persons include parents, employers, insurers,\ngovernmental entities, and others who pay for drug treatment or employee\nassistance programs, as well as infants injured as a result of exposure to\ndrugs in utero (\"drug babies\"). This Act will enable them to recover damages\nfrom those persons in the community who have joined the illegal drug market. A\nfurther purpose of the Act is to shift, to the extent possible, the cost of the\ndamage caused by the existence of the illegal drug market in a community to\nthose who illegally profit from that market. The further purpose of the Act is\nto establish the prospect of substantial monetary loss as a deterrent to those\nwho have not yet entered into the illegal drug distribution market. The\nfurther purpose is to establish an incentive for drug users to identify and\nseek payment for their own drug treatment from those dealers who have sold\ndrugs\nto the user in the past.",
