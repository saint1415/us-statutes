Whether the court of any other state would have jurisdiction under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of § 39A-202 of this title.(b) If the Court determines that it acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because a party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction engaged in unjustifiable conduct, it may assess against that party necessary and reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, investigative fees, court costs, communication expenses, witness fees and expenses, and travel expenses. The Court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses of any kind against this State or a governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this State unless authorized by law other than this chapter.76 Del.
