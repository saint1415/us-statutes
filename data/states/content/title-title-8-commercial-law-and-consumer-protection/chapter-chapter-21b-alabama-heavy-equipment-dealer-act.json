The term good cause shall not include the sale or purchase of a supplier. The term good cause shall be limited to withdrawal by the supplier, its successors, and assigns of the sale of its products in Alabama or dealer performance deficiencies including, but not limited to, failure by the dealer to comply substantially, without reasonable cause, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon such dealer in writing by the supplier, including, but not limited to, a substantial failure by a dealer to do the following:\n\n(1) Maintain a sales volume or trend of the supplier’s product line or lines comparable to that of other similarly situated dealers of that product line.\n\n(2) Render services comparable in quality, quantity, or volume to the services rendered by other dealers of the same product or product line similarly situated.\n\n(b) In any determination as to whether a dealer has failed to comply substantially, without reasonable cause, with any reasonable and material requirement imposed upon such dealer by the supplier, consideration shall be given to the relative size, population, geographical location, number of retail outlets, and demand for the products applicable to the relevant market area of the dealer and to other comparable market areas.\n\n(c) No supplier shall be required to give notice or show good cause pursuant to subsection (a) to unilaterally amend dealer agreements to comply with federal or state law or, where not inconsistent with this chapter, to amend uniformly dealer agreements as to all dealers of the supplier in all states in which the supplier is marketing its products.\n\n(d) In any dispute as to whether a supplier has acted with good cause as required by this chapter, the supplier shall have the burden of proof to establish that good cause existed.\n\n(Act 2009-755, p. 2279, §4.)",

The notice shall state all of the reasons for the intended amendment, termination, or nonrenewal.\n\n(b) Where such reason or reasons for amendment, termination, or nonrenewal relate to a condition or conditions which may be rectified by action of the dealer, the dealer shall have 90 days from the date of notice from the supplier in which to take such action and, within such 90-day period, shall give written notice to the supplier if and when such action is taken. If the condition or conditions have been rectified by the dealer, then the proposed amendment, termination, or nonrenewal shall be void and without legal effect. However, where the supplier contends that action on the part of the dealer has not rectified one or more of such conditions, the supplier must give written notice of such claimed deficiency to the dealer within 15 days after the dealer gave notice to the supplier of the action taken.\n\n(c) During the 120-day notice period provided for in subsection (a), the dealer shall have the right to contract for a transfer of the dealership business or dealer agreement to another person who meets the material and reasonable qualifications and standards required by the supplier for its dealers. The dealer shall give notice of any such transfer to the supplier at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the 120-day notice period.\n\n(d) A dealer agreement may be immediately terminated, amended, or nonrenewed and no notice shall be required if the reason for the amendment, termination, or nonrenewal is any of the following:\n\n(1) The bankruptcy or receivership of the dealer.\n\n(2) An assignment by the dealer for the benefit of the creditors or similar disposition of the assets of the business, other than the creation of a security interest in the assets of a dealer for the purpose of securing financing in the ordinary course of business.\n\n(3) Willful or intentional misrepresentation made by the dealer to the supplier with the express intent to defraud the supplier.\n\n(4) Failure of the dealer to conduct its customary sales and service operations during its customary business hours for seven consecutive business days, unless such failure has resulted from acts of God, casualties, strikes, or other similar circumstances beyond the dealer’s reasonable control.\n\n(5) A final conviction of the dealer principal of a felony.\n\n(Act 2009-755, p. 2279, §5.)",

Should a supplier determine that a proposed transferee does not meet its qualifications and standards, it shall give the dealer written notice thereof, stating the specific reasons for withholding consent. No prospective transferee shall be disqualified to be a dealer because it is a publicly held corporation.

The appointment of a successor dealer at the same location as its predecessor or within a two-mile radius therefrom within two years from the date on which its predecessor ceased operations or was terminated, whichever occurred later, shall not be construed as the entering into of an additional dealer agreement. Any supplier which intends to enter into a dealer agreement with another dealer in the relevant market area, at least 60 days prior to entering into such dealer agreement, shall give written notice of its intention to do so to each dealer of the same line make within the relevant market area. The notice shall state the date on or after which such proposed dealer agreement shall be entered into. Prior to the date set forth in the notice on or after which such dealer agreement will be entered into, any dealer in the relevant market area may file a civil action to determine whether the additional dealer agreement is unreasonable in which action the supplier shall have the burden of proof that the action is not unreasonable. No bond shall be required as a precondition to entry of an injunction enjoining the entering into of the additional dealer agreement. In determining whether an additional dealer agreement is unreasonable, the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances, including the following:\n\n(1) Whether the establishment of another dealer is warranted by economic and marketing conditions including anticipated future changes.\n\n(2) The past, present, and anticipated retail sales and service business transacted by the objecting dealer or dealers and other dealers of the same line make with a place of business in the relevant market area.\n\n(3) The investment made and obligations incurred by the objecting dealer or dealers and other dealers of the same line make with a place of business in the relevant market area.\n\n(d) No supplier shall require a dealer to prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from any liability or obligation under this chapter, which would limit the entitlement to recover damages under this chapter or other Alabama law, or which would waive the right to trial by jury. Any provision or agreement purporting to do so is void and unenforceable to the extent of the waiver or release. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or prohibit good faith settlements of disputes voluntarily entered into between the parties.\n\n(e) No supplier shall willfully discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price, programs, or terms of sale offered to dealers in this state when the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or to give one dealer who has a dealer agreement with the supplier any economic, business, or competitive advantage not offered to other dealers who have dealer agreements with such supplier.\n\n(Act 2009-755, p. 2279, §8.)",
