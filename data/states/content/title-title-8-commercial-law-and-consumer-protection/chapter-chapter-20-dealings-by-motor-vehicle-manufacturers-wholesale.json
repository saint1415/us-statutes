To accept, buy, or order any motor vehicle or vehicles, appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories therefor, or any other commodity or commodities or service or services which such motor vehicle dealer has not voluntarily ordered or requested except items required by applicable local, state, or federal law; or to require a motor vehicle dealer to accept, buy, order, or purchase such items in order to obtain any motor vehicle or vehicles or any other commodity or commodities which have been ordered or requested by such motor vehicle dealer.\n\nb. To order or accept delivery of any motor vehicle with special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment not included in the list price of the motor vehicles as publicly advertised by the manufacturer thereof, except items required by applicable law.\n\nc.

To participate monetarily in an advertising campaign or contest, or to purchase any promotional materials, training materials, showroom, or other display decorations or materials at the expense of the new motor vehicle dealer. This paragraph is not intended to modify any reasonable and uniformly applied provision of the franchise which requires the new motor vehicle dealer to advertise and promote the sale of vehicles and does not apply to campaigns, contests, advertising, and other promotional programs in which the new motor vehicle dealer voluntarily elects to participate.\n\ne. To refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of any other line of new motor vehicle or related products; provided that the new motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicle, and that the new motor vehicle dealer remains in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of the franchise.\n\nf. To change the location of the new motor vehicle dealership or, during the course of the agreement, to make any substantial alterations to the dealership premises when to do so would be unreasonable.\n\n1.

This section shall not be construed to eliminate, impair, damage, or otherwise limit a manufacturer’s intellectual property, trademark, or trade dress rights in any way. This paragraph shall not apply to goods or services paid for entirely by a manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, or wholesaler, distributor branch, or distributor representative nor to their initial design or architectural review service.\n\n2. This paragraph does not apply to routine facility maintenance or to construction or alterations necessary to comply with a health or safety law or technology requirements necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the dealer is authorized to sell and service.\n\n3. This paragraph is not intended to prohibit a manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, or wholesaler, distributor branch, or distributor representative from continuing a facility improvement program that is in effect as of March 12, 2018, with more than one new vehicle dealer in the state nor to any modification or renewal of the program or providing program payments to assist a new vehicle dealer in making agreed upon facility improvements, construction, or substantial alterations, including signage or an image element, or from enforcing a voluntary agreement between a new vehicle dealer and manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, or wholesaler, distributor branch, or distributor representative where separate and valuable consideration has been offered and accepted.\n\ng. To establish or maintain exclusive sales facilities or sales display space for a new motor vehicle line make unless such exclusive sales facilities or sales display space are reasonable and are otherwise justified by reasonable business considerations.

Provided, however, a manufacturer or distributor may not coerce, attempt to coerce, or require a motor vehicle dealer to establish or maintain exclusive personnel or exclusive service, parts, or administrative facilities for a line make.\n\nh. To adhere to performance standards that are not fair, reasonable, and equitable or that are not applied uniformly to other similarly situated dealers.

To engage in any acts which constitute fraud, deceit, or suppression under Sections 6-5-100 to 6-5-104, inclusive.\n\nj.

To adopt, change, establish, or implement a plan or system for the allocation and distribution of new or used motor vehicles to motor vehicle dealers which is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonably discriminatory or to modify an existing plan so as to cause the same to be arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonably discriminatory.\n\nb. To fail or refuse to advise or disclose to any motor vehicle dealer having a franchise or dealer agreement, upon written request therefor, the basis upon which new motor vehicles of the same line make are allocated or distributed to motor vehicle dealers in the state and the basis upon which the current allocation or distribution is being made or will be made to such motor vehicle dealer.\n\nc. To refuse to deliver to a motor vehicle dealer in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the motor vehicle dealer’s order any such motor vehicles as are covered by a franchise or dealer agreement and specifically publicly advertised in the state by such manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, or wholesaler, distributor branch, or distributor representative to be available for immediate delivery; provided, however, that the failure to deliver any motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this chapter if such failure is due to an act of God, a work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a lack of available manufacturing capacity, a freight embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer, factory branch, factory representative, distributor, or wholesaler, distributor branch, or distributor representative shall have no control.\n\nd. To cancel or terminate the franchise or dealer agreement of a motor vehicle dealer other than as hereinafter provided.\n\ne. To fail or refuse to extend the franchise or dealer agreement of a motor vehicle dealer upon its expiration other than as hereinafter provided.\n\nf.

To offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any new motor vehicle to any person, except a wholesaler’s or distributor’s or manufacturer’s employees, at a lower actual price therefor than the actual price offered and charged to a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle similarly equipped or to utilize any device which results in such lesser actual price and which are not offered to dealers of vehicles of the same line make; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle dealer for resale to any unit of the United States government, the state, or any of its political subdivisions.\n\ni. To prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from changing the executive management control of the motor vehicle dealer unless such change of executive management control will result in executive management control by a person or persons who are not of good moral character or who do not meet the manufacturer’s or wholesaler’s or distributor’s existing and reasonable capital standards and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and service of the new motor vehicle dealer, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area; provided, however, that where the manufacturer, or distributor, or wholesaler rejects a proposed change in executive management control, the manufacturer, or distributor, or wholesaler shall give written notice of his or her reasons to the motor vehicle dealer within 45 days of notice to the manufacturer, or wholesaler, or distributor by the motor vehicle dealer of the proposed change accompanied by information reflecting the identity, business experience and affiliations, and source of investment funds of the proposed new management.\n\nj. To prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from establishing or changing the capital structure of his or her dealership or the means by or through which he or she finances the operation thereof; provided, the dealer meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the motor vehicle dealer and the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, who may require that the sources, method, and manner by which the motor vehicle dealer finances or intends to finance its operation, equipment, or facilities be fully disclosed.\n\nk. To refuse to give effect to or prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle dealer or any officer, partner, or stockholder of any motor vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other person unless such sale or transfer is to a transferee who would not otherwise qualify for a new motor vehicle dealer’s license issued by the State of Alabama or a political subdivision thereof or unless such sale or transfer is to a person who is not of good moral character or who does not meet the manufacturer’s or wholesaler’s or distributor’s existing and reasonable capital standards and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area; provided, however, that where such a rejection of a transfer is made, the manufacturer or distributor or wholesaler shall give written notice of his or her reasons to the motor vehicle dealer within 60 days of notice to the manufacturer or wholesaler or distributor by the dealer of the proposed transfer, accompanied by information reflecting the identity of the new owner or owners, their business experience and affiliations, and the pro forma balance sheet and source of investment funds of the proposed new dealership. A manufacturer or distributor may exercise a contractual right of first refusal with respect to the sale or transfer of the interest of the dealer only if each of the following requirements are met:\n\n1. The sale or transfer is not to a family member of an owner of the dealership, nor a managerial employee of the dealership owning 15 percent or more of the dealership, nor a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity owned by the existing owners of the dealership. For purposes of this subparagraph, a “family member” means the spouse of an owner of the dealership, the child, grandchild, brother, sister, or parent of an owner, or a spouse of one of those family members.\n\n2. The manufacturer or distributor notifies the dealer in writing within 60 days after receipt of the completed application forms and related information generally used by a manufacturer or distributor to conduct its review and a copy of all agreements regarding the proposed transfer of its intent to exercise its right of first refusal or its rejection of the proposed transfer. If the manufacturer or distributor fails to notify the dealer of its exercise of the right of first refusal or its rejection of the proposed transferee within the 60-day period, the effect of such failure shall constitute approval of the proposed sale or transfer. If the manufacturer or distributor exercises a right of first refusal under this section, the transfer shall be deemed to be rejected.\n\n3. The exercise of the right of first refusal provides to the dealer the same compensation as, or greater compensation than, the dealer had negotiated to receive from the proposed buyer or transferee.\n\n4. The manufacturer or distributor agrees to pay the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ and accountants’ fees that do not exceed the usual, customary, and reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients incurred by the proposed buyer or transferee before the manufacturer’s or distributor’s exercise of its right of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the contract for the sale or transfer. The proposed buyer or transferee shall provide to the manufacturer or distributor a written itemization of the expenses incurred within 30 days of the receipt by the proposed buyer or transferee of a written request from the manufacturer or distributor for an accounting of the expenses. The manufacturer or distributor shall make payment of these expenses within 30 days of exercising the right of first refusal.\n\nl. To unreasonably and without notice to existing motor vehicle dealers, as hereinafter provided, enter into a franchise with an additional motor vehicle dealer who intends to conduct its dealership operations from a place of business situated within the relevant market area of an existing motor vehicle dealer or motor vehicle dealers representing the same line make. The appointment of a successor motor vehicle dealer at the same location as its predecessor or within a two-mile radius therefrom within two years from the date on which its predecessor ceased operations or was terminated, whichever occurred later, shall not be construed as the entering into of an additional franchise. Any manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, factory branch, factory representative, distributor branch, or distributor representative which intends to enter into an additional franchise shall, at least 60 days prior to granting such franchise, give written notice of its intention to do so to each motor vehicle dealer of the same line make within the relevant market area.

Prior to the date set forth in the notice on or after which such franchise will be entered into, any such motor vehicle dealer may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to determine whether such appointment or proposed appointment is unreasonable in which action the manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor shall have the burden of proof that such action is not unreasonable. No bond shall be required as a precondition to entry of an injunction enjoining appointment of an additional franchise. Such petition shall be entitled to a speedy trial. In determining whether such proposed appointment is unreasonable, the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances. These may include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Whether the establishment of such additional franchise is warranted by economic and marketing conditions including anticipated future changes.\n\n2. The past, present, and anticipated retail sales and service business transacted by the objecting motor vehicle dealer or dealers and other motor vehicle dealers of the same line make with a place of business in the relevant market area.\n\n3. The investment made and obligations incurred by the objecting motor vehicle dealer or dealers and other motor vehicle dealers of the same line make with a place of business in the relevant market area.\n\n4.

Relieves any person from any liability or obligation under this chapter.\n\n2. Requires any controversy between a new motor vehicle dealer and a manufacturer to be referred to any person other than the duly constituted courts of this state or the United States, if the referral would be binding on the new motor vehicle dealer.\n\n3. Limits the entitlement to recover damages under this chapter or other Alabama law.\n\n4. Specifies the jurisdiction or venues in which disputes arising with respect to the franchise shall or shall not be submitted for resolution or otherwise prohibits a dealer from bringing an action in the courts of Alabama.\n\n5. Waives the right to trial by jury.\n\nn. To prevent or refuse to give effect to the succession to the ownership or management control of a dealership upon the death or incapacity of a motor vehicle dealer to any legatee or devisee under the will of a dealer or to an heir under the laws of descent and distribution of this state unless the successor is a person who is not of good moral character or who does not meet the manufacturer’s or distributor’s or wholesaler’s existing and reasonable capital standards and, with consideration given to the volume of the sales and service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area; provided, however, that where such a rejection of succession is made, the manufacturer or distributor or wholesaler shall give written notice of his or her reasons to the proposed successor within 60 days of notice to the manufacturer or wholesaler or distributor by the proposed successor of his or her intent to succeed to the ownership or management of the dealership, accompanied by information reflecting the identity of the new owner or owners, their business experience and affiliation, and the pro forma balance sheet and source of investment funds of the proposed new dealership. This section does not preclude the owner of a new motor vehicle dealer from designating any person as his or her successor by written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor and, in the event there is a conflict between such written instrument and the provisions of this section, the written instrument shall govern.\n\no. To fail to indemnify and hold harmless its motor vehicle dealers against any losses, including, but not limited to, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, or damages arising out of complaints, claims, or lawsuits, including, but not limited to, strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, warranty (express or implied), or rescission of the sale where the complaint, claim, or lawsuit relates to any of the following:\n\n1. The manufacture, assembly, or design of new motor vehicles, parts, or accessories.\n\n2. A defect in any forms furnished to the dealer or in the written instructions for the completion of such forms by the manufacturer, an affiliate of the manufacturer, or person controlled by the manufacturer used in connection with the sale, lease, or financing of a vehicle and associated products, unless the dealer improperly completes the forms or makes misrepresentations contrary either to the terms of the forms or the written instructions for their completion.\n\n3. Other functions by the manufacturer, beyond the control of the dealer, including, without limitation, the selection by the manufacturer of parts or components for the vehicle, or any damages to merchandise occurring in transit to the dealer where the carrier is designated by the manufacturer.\n\np. To increase prices of new motor vehicles which the new motor vehicle dealer had ordered for retail consumers prior to the dealer’s receipt of the written official price increase notification. A sales contract signed by a retail consumer shall constitute evidence of each such order; provided that the vehicle is in fact delivered to that customer. In the event of manufacturer price reductions or cash rebates, the amount of any such reduction or rebate received by a dealer shall be passed on to the retail consumer by the dealer if the retail price was negotiated on the basis of the previous higher price to the dealer. Price reductions shall apply to all vehicles in the dealer’s inventory which were subject to the price reduction. Price differences applicable to new model or series motor vehicles at the time of the introduction of new models or series shall not be considered a price increase or price decrease. Price changes caused by any of the following shall not be subject to the provisions of this paragraph:\n\n1. The addition to a motor vehicle of required or optional equipment pursuant to state or federal law.\n\n2. Revaluation of the United States dollar, in the case of foreign-made vehicles or components.\n\n3.

The provisions in this paragraph shall not apply to recreational vehicles and reasonable requirements of a manufacturer that its dealers obtain tools or diagnostic equipment to properly service its line make of motor vehicles. The failure to deliver any such new motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this section if the failure is due to a lack of manufacturing capacity or to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight embargo, or any other cause over which the manufacturer has no control.\n\nw.

To charge back, deny vehicle allocation, withhold payments, or take any other adverse actions against a dealer because of a sale of a new motor vehicle which is exported from the United States unless the manufacturer can prove that the dealer knew or reasonably should have known on the date of the sale that the new motor vehicle was to be exported. A dealer is rebuttably presumed to have no knowledge of the intended export if the vehicle is sold by the dealer to a United States resident who titles and registers the vehicle in any state in the United States.\n\ny.

All work and services, except warranty work, performed on a new motor vehicle by a motor vehicle dealer at the direction of the warrantor prior to the delivery of the vehicle to the first retail consumer.\n\n(2) REPAIR ORDER. An invoice, paid by a retail customer, and closed as of the time of submission, encompassing one or more repairs to a motor vehicle, and reflecting, in the case of a parts markup submission, the cost of each part and the sale price thereof, and in the case of a labor rate submission, the total charges for labor and the total number of hours that produced the charges, which invoice may be submitted in electronic form.\n\n(3) QUALIFIED REPAIR. A repair to a motor vehicle paid by a retail customer, which would have come within the warrantor’s new motor vehicle warranty, but for the motor vehicle having exceeded the chronological or mileage limit of such warranty, and which does not constitute any of the work encompassed by subdivision (f)(5).\n\n(4) QUALIFIED REPAIR ORDER. A repair order which encompasses, in whole or in part, a qualified repair or repairs.\n\n(5) WARRANTOR. A manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, factory branch, factory representative, distributor branch, or distributor representative.\n\n(6) WARRANTY WORK. All labor, including that of a diagnostic character, performed, and all parts, including original or replacement parts, and components, including engine, transmission, and other parts assemblies, installed by motor vehicle dealers on motor vehicles which are reasonably incurred by motor vehicle dealers, other than the incidental expenses incurred in performing labor and installing parts on motor vehicles, in fulfilling a warrantor’s obligations under a new motor vehicle warranty, a recall, or a certified pre-owned warranty, to consumers, including, but not limited to, the expense of shipping or returning defective parts to the warrantor, when required by the warrantor.\n\n(b) Every warrantor shall specify in writing to each of its motor vehicle dealers the dealer’s obligation for pre-delivery service and warranty service on its products, shall compensate the motor vehicle dealer for the service required of the dealer by the warrantor, and shall provide the dealer the schedule of compensation to be paid the dealer for parts, work, and service in connection with the services, and the time allowance for the performance of such work and service.\n\n(c) In no event shall the schedule of compensation fail to include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, service, labor, and parts. Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service shall be reasonable and adequate for the work to be performed. In no event shall such compensation of a dealer for warranty services including labor and parts, be less than the rates or prices charged by the dealer for like service to retail customers for nonwarranty service, repairs, and parts, provided that such prices and rates are not unreasonable. This subsection does not apply to compensation for parts, systems, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, accessories, and features of a motor home that are designed, used, and maintained primarily for non-vehicular residential purposes, or parts related to motorcycle repairs.\n\n(d) It is a violation of this section for any warrantor to fail to perform any warranty obligations under the motor vehicle manufacturer’s warranty, or to fail to include in written notices of factory recalls to dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correction of such defects, or to fail to compensate any of the motor vehicle dealers for repairs effected by the recall.\n\n(e) All claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for such labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days following their approval; provided, however, that the warrantor retains the right to audit such claims and to charge back the dealer for any fraudulent claims for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date the claim was paid. All such claims shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days after their receipt on forms and in the manner specified by the warrantor, and any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days after the receipt shall be construed to be approved and payment must follow within 30 days. A warrantor shall not disapprove claims for which the dealer has received preauthorization from the warrantor or its representative nor shall the warrantor unreasonably disapprove a claim solely based on the dealer’s incidental failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement that results only in a clerical error or administrative error; rather a claim denial must be based upon a material defect and deviation from the reasonable written claim submission requirements of the manufacturer. In the event of neglect, oversight, or mistake by the dealer, a dealer may submit an amended claim, or may submit a claim not submitted within the time required by the warrantor, for labor and parts up to 120 days from the date on which the claim was first submitted or could have been submitted.\n\n(f)(1) For the purposes of this section, reasonable compensation shall be determined as provided in this subsection.\n\n(2) The markup customarily charged by the dealer for parts or its labor rate may be established at the election of the dealer by the dealer submitting to the warrantor, either by electronic transmission or tangible delivery, all consecutive repair orders that include 100 sequential repair orders reflecting qualified repairs, or all repair orders closed during any period of 90 consecutive days, whichever produces the fewer number of repair orders, covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the submission and declaring the parts markup or labor rate.\n\n(3) The dealer shall calculate its labor rate by determining the total charges for labor from the qualified repairs submitted and dividing that amount by the total number of hours that produced the charges. The dealer shall calculate its parts markup by determining the total charges for parts from the qualified repairs submitted, dividing that amount by its total cost of the purchase of the parts, subtracting one from that amount, and multiplying by 100 to produce a percentage.\n\n(4) A motor vehicle dealer seeking to establish or modify its warranty reimbursement labor rate, parts markup, or both, not more frequently than once per 12-month period, shall submit to the warrantor one of the following:\n\na. A single set of repair orders for purposes of calculating both its labor rate and parts markup.\n\nb. A set of repair orders for purposes of calculating only its labor rate or for purposes of calculating only its parts markup.\n\n(5) In calculating the rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor for purposes of this subsection, the following shall not be included in the calculation of the rate:\n\na. Repairs that are the subject of manufacturer or distributor discounts, such as special events, specials, promotions, coupons, or service campaigns.\n\nb. Repairs of motor vehicles owned by the dealer.\n\nc. Routine maintenance, including, but not limited to, replacements of fluids, filters, batteries, bulbs, belts, nuts, bolts, or fasteners, unless provided in the course of, and related to, an otherwise qualified repair.\n\nd. Installations of accessories.\n\ne. Replacements of or work on tires, wheels, including alignments, wheel or tire rotations, or replacements of brake drums, rotors, shoes, or pads.\n\nf. Vehicle reconditioning.\n\ng. Safety or emission inspections required by law.\n\nh. Repairs for which volume discounts have been negotiated with government agencies.\n\ni. Body shop repairs, including repairs covered by insurance, for conditions caused by collision, road hazard, the force of the elements, vandalism, theft, or the negligence or deliberate act of the owner, operator, or a third party.\n\nj. Parts that do not have individual part numbers.\n\nk. Warrantor approved and reimbursed goodwill repairs or reimbursements.\n\nl. Window replacement, window etching, window tint, protective film, or other masking products.\n\n(6) a. The submitted parts markup or labor rate shall go into effect 45 days after the warrantor’s receipt of its submission, unless, within that period, the warrantor reasonably substantiates that the submission is materially incomplete, materially inaccurate, or is materially unreasonable and provides a full explanation of any reasons that the submitted markup or rate is materially incomplete, materially inaccurate, or materially unreasonable, evidence validating each reason, a copy of all calculations used by the warrantor demonstrating any material inaccuracy, and a proposed adjusted markup or rate provided that the dealer’s submission is materially accurate based upon the qualified repair orders submitted by the dealer. In that event, the warrantor may submit only one rebuttal to the dealer, and may not thereafter add to, expand, supplement, or otherwise modify any element thereof, including, but not limited to, the warrantor’s grounds for contesting the parts markup or labor rate, unless the warrantor did not possess the information at the time of its rebuttal, or if the information is used for the purpose of rebutting the dealer’s response to the warrantor’s rebuttal.\n\nb. If a warrantor determines from any set of repair orders submitted under this subsection that the labor rate or parts markup calculated under this subsection is substantially higher or lower than the rate currently on record with the warrantor for labor or parts, or both, the warrantor, in accordance with this subsection, may request additional repair orders for a period of 60 days prior to or 60 days subsequent to the time period for which the repair orders were submitted for purposes of an alteration, and shall have 45 days from receiving the additional repair orders to rebut the presumption that the dealer’s proposed markup and labor rates are reasonable.\n\n(7) If the dealer and the warrantor do not agree on the parts markup or labor rate, the dealer may file an action in a court having jurisdiction in this state within 120 days of receiving the warrantor’s written rejection of the dealer’s proposed parts markup or labor rate. In that action, the warrantor shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the dealer’s submitted parts markup or labor rate, or both, was materially incomplete, materially inaccurate, or materially unreasonable. Upon a court decision in favor of the dealer finding that the labor or parts rate shall be more than proposed by the warrantor, any increase in the dealer’s parts markup or labor rate arising from the proceeding shall be effective retroactively to the date 45 days following the warrantor’s receipt of the original submission to the dealer or to the warrantor.\n\n(8) In the determination of what constitutes materially unreasonable compensation under this section, relevant factors include, but are not limited to, the prevailing wage rates paid by similarly situated dealers in the state.\n\n(Acts 1981, No. 81-390, p. 596, §7; Acts 1991, No. 91-212, p. 398, §1; Act 2000-267, p. 415, §1; Act 2010-198, p. 300, §1; Act 2022-104, §1.)",

A manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, factory branch, or distributor branch.\n\n(2) STOP-SALE ORDER. A notification issued by a manufacturer to its franchised new motor vehicle dealers stating that certain used vehicles in inventory shall not be sold or leased, at either retail or wholesale, due to a federal safety recall for a defect or a noncompliance, or a federal emissions recall.\n\n(b) A manufacturer shall compensate its new motor vehicle dealers for all labor and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs. Compensation for recall repairs shall be reasonable. If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall service or repair on a used vehicle held for sale by a dealer authorized to sell and service new vehicles of the same line-make within 30 days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall, and the manufacturer has issued a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order on the vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer at a prorated rate of at least one percent of the value of the vehicle per month beginning on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was provided to the dealer until the earlier of either of the following:\n\n(1) The date the recall or remedy parts are made available.\n\n(2) The date the dealer sells, trades, or otherwise disposes of the affected used motor vehicle.\n\n(c) The value of a used vehicle shall be the average trade-in value for used vehicles as indicated in an independent third party guide for the year, make, and model of the recalled vehicle.\n\n(d) This section shall apply only to used vehicles subject to safety or emissions recalls pursuant to and recalled in accordance with federal law and regulations adopted thereunder and where a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order has been issued and repair parts or remedy remain unavailable for 30 days or longer. This section further shall apply only to new motor vehicle dealers holding an affected used vehicle for sale:\n\n(1) In inventory at the time the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was issued; or\n\n(2) Which was taken in the used vehicle inventory of the dealer as a consumer trade-in incident to the purchase of a new vehicle from the dealer after the Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order was issued; and\n\n(3) That is a line-make that the dealer is franchised to sell or on which the dealer is authorized to perform recall repairs.\n\n(e) Subject to the audit provisions of subsection (d) of Section 8-20-7, it shall be a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount of compensation otherwise owed to an individual new motor vehicle dealer, whether through a chargeback, removal of the individual dealer from an incentive program, or reduction in amount owed under an incentive program solely because the new motor vehicle dealer has submitted a claim for reimbursement under this section. This subsection shall not apply to an action by a manufacturer that is applied uniformly among all dealers of the same line-make in the state.\n\n(f) All reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to a Stop-Sale or Do-Not-Drive order, shall be subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement claim made under subsection (d) of Section 8-20-7. In the alternative, a manufacturer may compensate its franchised dealers under a national recall compensation program, provided the compensation under the program is equal to or greater than that provided under subsection (b) or as the manufacturer and dealer otherwise agree.\n\n(g) A manufacturer may direct the manner and method in which a dealer must demonstrate the inventory status of an affected used motor vehicle to determine eligibility under this section, provided that the manner and method may not be unduly burdensome and may not require information that is unduly burdensome to provide.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall require a manufacturer to provide total compensation to a dealer which would exceed the total average trade-in value of the affected used motor vehicle as originally determined under subsection (c).\n\n(i) Any remedy provided to a dealer under this section is exclusive and may not be combined with any other state or federal recall compensation remedy.\n\n(Act 2017-148, §1.)",
