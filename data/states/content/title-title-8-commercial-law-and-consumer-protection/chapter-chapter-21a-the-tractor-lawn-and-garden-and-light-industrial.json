      "text": "Section 8-21A-3\n\nViolations by Suppliers Generally.\n\nIt shall be a violation of this chapter for a supplier to do any of the following:\n\n(1) To coerce, compel, or require any dealer to order or accept delivery of any equipment or parts with special features or accessories not included in the base list price of such equipment as publicly advertised by the supplier which the dealer has not voluntarily ordered.\n\n(2) To coerce, compel, or require any dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, as a supplement to an existing dealer agreement with such supplier unless such supplemental agreement is imposed on all other dealers in the state doing business with that same supplier.\n\n(3) To discriminate in the delivery of equipment to any dealer in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the equipment dealer’s order, if the equipment covered by the dealer agreement was specifically represented by the supplier to be available for immediate delivery. However, the failure to deliver the equipment shall not be considered a violation of this chapter if the failure is due to prudent and reasonable restriction on the extension of credit by the supplier to the dealer, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or a labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or other causes over which the supplier has no control.\n\n(4) To terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a dealer’s agreement or substantially alter that dealer’s competitive circumstances without good cause.\n\n(5) To condition the renewal or extension of a dealer agreement on the dealer’s substantial renovation of the dealer’s place of business or on the construction, purchase, acquisition, or rental of a new place of business by the dealer, unless:\n\na. the dealer is given at least 12 months’ notice in advance;\n\nb. the supplier’s demand is shown to be reasonable; and\n\nc. the supplier can demonstrate an actual need or necessity for such a change in the place of business in order that the dealer be in a position to adequately serve the public’s needs in his or her trade area at that particular time.\n\n(6) To discriminate in the offering of net prices, sale promotion plans, or any and all other devices of programs that affect the ultimate net price paid by the dealer for any item of equipment offered to the dealer by the supplier. “Item of equipment” shall include, but not be limited to, tractors, any equipment or attachments, garden tractors, lawn and garden equipment, or any other items offered by supplier to their dealer. This subdivision shall not apply to the sales to an equipment dealer for resale to any unit or agency of the United States government, the state, or any of its political subdivisions or any municipality located within this state, and provided further that there is no violation of this subdivision so long as a supplier sells or offers to sell its products to all of its dealers at an equal price.\n\n(7) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any dealer from changing the capital structure of his or her dealership or the means or sources through which he or she finances the operation of his or her dealership so long as the dealer continues to meet the reasonable capital requirements which have previously been agreed upon by dealer and supplier and the change does not result in a change of controlling interest, or in the executive management of the dealership.\n\n(8) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any equipment dealer or any officer, member, partner, or stockholder of any dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any one of them to any other person or persons or party or parties. However, no dealer, officer, partner, member, or stockholder shall have the right to sell, transfer, or assign the dealership and/or the dealer agreement without the written consent of the supplier, provided however that consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(9) To require the dealer to agree to a release, agreement, waiver, or any other modification that would relieve supplier or dealer from liability imposed by this chapter.\n\n(10)a. To unreasonably withhold consent, in the event of the death of the dealer or the principal owner of the dealership, to the transfer of the dealer’s interest in the dealership to a member or members of the family of the dealer or the principal owner of the dealership or to another qualified individual if the family member or other qualified individual meets the reasonable requirements, business experience, and character standards required of all dealers at that time by the supplier. In the event the supplier determines that the designated family member or other qualified individual is not acceptable, the supplier shall provide the dealer or his or her family with written notice of its objections and specific reasons for withholding its consent. Frivolous or capricious reasons will not be acceptable to satisfy the requirements of this section. A supplier shall have 30 days in which to consider and make a determination on a dealer’s request to make a transfer to a family member or other qualified individual. As used herein, “family” means a spouse, parents, siblings, children, stepchildren, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and lineal descendants including those by adoption of the dealer or principal owner of the dealership.\n\nb. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a supplier and dealer have previously duly executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior to the dealer’s death, and if the agreement has not been revoked, the agreement shall be observed, even if it designates someone other than the surviving spouse or heirs of the decedent as the successor.\n\n(11) To prevent a dealer from having an investment in or holding a dealership contract for the sale of competing product lines or makes of equipment, or to require a dealer to provide separate facilities for competing product lines or makes of equipment.\n\n(12) To impose, directly or indirectly, unreasonable restrictions on the dealer relative to transfer, renewal, termination, location, or site control.\n\n(13) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the supplier may determine that a dealer’s area of responsibility or trade area does not afford sufficient sales potential to continue to reasonably support a dealer.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-721, p. 1401,§3; Act 2003-356, p. 976, §1.)",

The notice shall state all reasons relied upon by supplier to show good cause for the action and shall provide the dealer with a reasonable time in which to correct any claimed deficiency with a minimum of at least six months. Once mutually agreeable steps have been outlined, agreed upon, and implemented, then the notice of termination shall be void. The contractual terms of the dealer agreement shall not expire or a change be made in the dealer’s competitive circumstances, without the written consent of the dealer, prior to the expiration of at least 90 days following the notice.\n\n(b) As used in this chapter, a termination by a supplier of a dealer’s agreement or a change by the supplier in dealer’s competitive circumstances, shall be with good cause when the dealer has done any of the following:\n\n(1) Transferred a controlling ownership interest in the dealership without the supplier’s consent.\n\n(2) Made a material misrepresentation to the supplier when applying for the dealer agreement.\n\n(3) Filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against the dealer which has not been discharged within 60 days after the filing; is in default under the provisions of a security agreement in effect with the supplier; or is insolvent or in receivership.\n\n(4) Been convicted of a felony.\n\n(5) Failed to operate in the normal course of business for seven consecutive business days or has terminated the business.\n\n(6) Relocated the dealer’s place of business without the supplier’s consent.\n\n(7) Consistently engaged in business practices which are detrimental to the consumer or supplier by way of excessive pricing, misleading advertising, failure to provide service and replacement parts or perform warranty obligations.\n\n(8) Consistently failed to comply with the applicable licensing laws pertaining to the products and services being represented for and on supplier’s behalf.\n\n(c) No supplier shall base its decision to terminate, cancel, or not renew a dealer agreement or to change the dealer’s competitive circumstances on any of the subdivisions of subsection (b) except subdivisions (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) thereof unless the supplier can demonstrate through written documentation and clear and convincing evidence, the alleged lack of sales demand to support a dealership, alleged misconduct and/or lack of performance or other deficiency of the dealer. Furthermore, supplier shall also show that the reason for the decision to terminate, cancel, or not renew the dealer agreement or change the dealer’s competitive circumstances was in no way caused by supplier’s actions.\n\n(d) Before termination of the franchise or selling agreement because of the failure of a dealer to meet reasonable marketing criteria or market penetration, the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler shall provide written notice of that intention at least one year in advance. After notice, the manufacturer or other entity issuing the notice shall make good faith efforts to work with the dealer to gain the desired market share including, without limitation, reasonably making available to the dealer an adequate inventory of new equipment and parts and competitive marketing programs. The manufacturer or other entity, at the end of the one-year notice period, may terminate or elect not to renew the agreement only upon further written notice specifying the reasons for determining that the dealer failed to meet reasonable criteria or market penetration. The written notice shall specify that termination is effective 90 days from the date of the notice. If the dealer cures the claimed deficiency within the 90-day period, the franchise or selling agreement shall not be terminated.\n\n(e) Any manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler which intends to establish a new dealership or to relocate a current dealership for a particular product line or make of equipment within the relevant market area of an existing dealership of the same product line or make of equipment shall give a written 90-day notice of that intent by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to the existing dealership. The notice shall include all of the following:\n\n(1) The specific location of the additional or relocated dealership.\n\n(2) The date on or after which the additional or relocated dealership will commence operation at the new location.\n\n(3) The identity of all existing dealerships in whose relevant market area the new or relocated dealership is to be located.\n\n(4) The names and addresses of the dealer and principals in the new or relocated dealership.\n\n(f) A manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler may sell or lease new equipment for use within this state. If the equipment is prepared for delivery or serviced by a dealer, the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler shall reasonably compensate the dealer for the preparation and delivery of the new equipment and pay to the dealer a reasonable commission on the sale or lease of the new equipment which shall not be less than eight percent of the sale price of the equipment. The manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, if practicable, shall utilize the dealer in the relevant market area described in this subsection for preparation and delivery. This compensation shall be paid or credited in the same manner as provided in Section 8-21A-10. This subsection shall not be applicable to any liquidation or sale of equipment which has been ordered by any court. For purposes of this subsection, equipment is considered to be used primarily within the relevant market area of a dealer if the new equipment is located or housed at a facility of the user located within that relevant market area.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-721, p. 1401, §4; Act 2003-356, p. 976, §1.)",

This surplus procedure shall be administered as follows:\n\n(1) The supplier must notify its equipment dealers of a time period, in no event less than 90 days’ duration, during which time equipment dealers may submit their surplus parts lists and return their surplus parts to the supplier.\n\n(2) Pursuant to this subdivision, a supplier must allow surplus parts return authority on a dollar value of parts equal to 10 percent of the total dollar value of parts purchased on stock order by the dealer from the supplier during the twelve month period immediately preceding the notification to the dealer by the supplier or the surplus parts return program, or the month the dealer’s return request is made, whichever is applicable. However, the dealer may wish to return less than 10 percent of the total value of stock order parts purchased by the dealer from supplier during the preceding twelve month period as provided above.

The dealer can elect to pursue either his or her dealer agreement remedy or the remedy provided by state law, and an election by the dealer to pursue the agreement remedy shall not bar the right to the remedy provided herein as to those repair parts not affected by the contract remedy. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the rights of a supplier to charge back to the dealer’s account previously paid or credited as a discount incident to the dealer’s purchase of goods shall not be affected.

The supplier shall have the right to adjust errors discovered during audit and if necessary to adjust claims collected in error.\n\n(c) It shall be unlawful to deny, delay payment for, or restrict a claim by a dealer for warranty service or parts, incentives, hold-backs, or other amounts owed to a dealer unless the denial, delay, or restriction is the direct result of a material defect in the claim that affects its validity.\n\n(d) A manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler may audit warranty claims submitted by its dealers only for a period of up to one year following payment of the claims and may charge back to its dealers only those amounts based upon paid claims shown by the audit to be invalid except that this limitation shall not apply in any case of fraudulent claims.\n\n(e) Any audit of a dealer by or on behalf of a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler for sales incentives, service incentives, rebates, or other forms of incentive compensation shall be completed not later than six months after the date of the termination of the incentive compensation program except that this limitation shall not apply in any case of fraudulent claims.\n\n(Acts 1991, No. 91-721, p. 1401, §10; Act 2003-356, p. 976, §1.)",
