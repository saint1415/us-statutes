      "text": "Section 8-19G-1\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds and declares the following:\n\n(1) The pervasive use of pornography is creating a public health crisis.\n\n(2) Pornography is contributing to the hypersexualization of children and teens in our society.\n\n(3) Due to advances in technology and the universal availability of the Internet, young children are more easily exposed to pornography than ever before, with the average age of exposure now being only 11 to 12 years of age.\n\n(4) Pornography treats people as objects and commodities for the viewer’s use.\n\n(5) Pornography normalizes violence and abuse, often depicts rape and abuse as being harmless fun, and increases the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution, and child pornography.\n\n(6) Pornography is a public health crisis leading to a broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms. This state has a compelling governmental interest to take action, and this chapter serves as the most narrowly tailored approach to prevent pornography exposure and addiction to minors and to educate individuals and families concerning its very serious harms.\n\n(Act 2024-97, §1.)",
