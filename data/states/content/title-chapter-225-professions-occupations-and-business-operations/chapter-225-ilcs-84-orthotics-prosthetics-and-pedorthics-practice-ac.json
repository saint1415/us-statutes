The\npractice of pedorthics in the State of Illinois is an allied health profession with educational standards established by the National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education. The\nincreasing population of elderly and physically challenged individuals who need\northotic, prosthetic, and pedorthic services requires that the orthotic,\nprosthetic, and pedorthic professions be regulated to ensure the provision of\nhigh-quality services and devices. The people of Illinois deserve the best\ncare available, and will benefit from the assurance of initial and ongoing\nprofessional competence of the orthotists, prosthetists, and pedorthists\npracticing in this State. The practice of orthotics, prosthetics, and\npedorthics serves to improve and enhance the lives of individuals with\ndisabilities by enabling them to resume productive lives following serious\nillness, injury, or trauma. Unregulated dispensing of orthotic, prosthetic,\nand pedorthic care does not adequately meet the needs or serve the\ninterests of the public. In keeping with State requirements imposed on similar\nhealth\ndisciplines, licensure of the orthotic, prosthetic, and pedorthic professions\nwill help\nensure the health and safety of consumers, as well as maximize their functional\nabilities\nand productivity levels. This Act shall be liberally construed to best carry\nout these\nsubjects and purposes.",
