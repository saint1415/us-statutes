      "text": "Purpose. The State of Illinois declares that it is the public policy of the State to promote and encourage the continuing economic development of minority-owned and women-owned and operated businesses and that minority-owned and women-owned and operated businesses participate in the State's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors. The State of Illinois has observed that the goals established in this Act have served to increase the participation of minority and women businesses in contracts awarded by the State. The State hereby declares that the adoption of this amendatory Act of 1989 shall serve the State's continuing interest in promoting open access in the awarding of State contracts to disadvantaged small business enterprises victimized by discriminatory practices. Furthermore, after reviewing evidence of the high level of attainment of the 10% minimum goals established under this Act, and, after considering evidence that minority and women businesses, as established in 1982, constituted and continue to constitute more than 10% of the businesses operating in this State, the State declares that the continuation of such 10% minimum goals under this amendatory Act of 1989 is a narrowly tailored means of promoting open access and thus the further growth and development of minority and women businesses.",
