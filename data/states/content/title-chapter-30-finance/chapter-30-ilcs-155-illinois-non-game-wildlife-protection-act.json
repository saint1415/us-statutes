The General Assembly specifically recognizes that such non-game\nwildlife includes protected wildlife and wildlife of specialized habitats,\nboth terrestrial and aquatic types, and mollusks, crustaceans, and other\ninvertebrates under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources.\nThis Act is enacted to provide a means by which such protection may be financed\nthrough a voluntary check-off designation on State income tax return forms.\nThe intent of the General Assembly is that this program of the income tax\ncheck-off is supplemental to any funding and in no way is intended to take\nthe place of the funding that would otherwise be appropriated for this purpose.",
