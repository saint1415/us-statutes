To provide this protection, (1) an association of insurers is created to enable the guaranty of payment of benefits and of continuation of coverages, as limited in the act, and (2) members of the association are made subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purposes of the act.SourceLaws 1975, LB 217, § 1;Laws 1986, LB 593, § 3.AnnotationsResident employees, and not a nonresident trustee, are entitled to protection under this section.
