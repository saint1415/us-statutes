      "text": "and medical knowledge concerning the effects of cannabis makes it necessary\nto acknowledge the physical, psychological and sociological damage which is\nincumbent upon its use; and (2) the use of cannabis occupies the unusual\nposition of being widely used and pervasive among the citizens of Illinois\ndespite its harmful effects; and (3) previous legislation enacted to\ncontrol or forbid the use of cannabis has often unnecessarily and\nunrealistically drawn a large segment of our population within the criminal\njustice system without succeeding in deterring the expansion of cannabis\nuse. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly, in the interest\nof the health and welfare of the citizens of Illinois, to establish a\nreasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state of\nknowledge concerning cannabis and which directs the greatest efforts of law\nenforcement agencies toward the commercial traffickers and large-scale\npurveyors of cannabis. To this end, this Act provides wide latitude in the\nsentencing discretion of the courts and establishes penalties in a sharply\nrising progression based on the amount of substances containing cannabis\ninvolved in each case.",
