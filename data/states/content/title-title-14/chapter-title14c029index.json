Safety requirements for public school buses.No rule or regulation made by the Department of Education under this chapter shall preclude the use of district school buses or state school buses 14 model years old, provided such buses meet safety requirements and are approved by the board of education named in the contract. There shall be no capital allowance provided for the contractor other than that provided for in the transportation formula for school bus contracts using the schedule for the model year of the bus used.62 Del. Laws, c. 275,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 180,\n\n§\n\n 142;77 Del. Laws, c. 327,\n\n§\n\n 363;§\n\n2908. Renewal of transportation contracts; transfer; letters of commitment.(a) When a transportation contract is due to expire for a reason other than the fact that the bus described in said contract is of such vintage that it can no longer be used to transport pupils, a renewal of said contract shall be first offered to the school bus contractor who is party to the expiring contract. In the event that a contractor does not wish to renew the contract, said contract shall be opened to all other interested persons in that area by means of notice published in at least 2 Delaware newspapers of general circulation.(b) If no parties can be found to assume the responsibilities of contracts expiring pursuant to this section, the department or agency responsible for the transportation of public school pupils shall furnish the transportation previously afforded under the expiring contract.(c) (1) A school transportation contract may be transferred from a contractor to another party contingent upon approval of the local board of education. In the event that a transfer is proposed by the current contractor, the advertising requirement contained in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply.(2) A local board of education may disapprove the transfer of a transportation contract to another party only for just cause. Just cause shall be limited to the following criteria: Financial stability, insurability, record of service in that or another Delaware school district, and personal and/or business resume including references.(3) If the school board decides to reject the prospective contractor, it shall notify that contractor of its decision and provide reasons why that contractor is not acceptable to the district. This discussion may be held in a closed session and the results and reasons shall be disclosed only with the approval of the proposed contractor. In the event that the district rejects the proposed contractor, the current contractor shall have the following options:a. Continue to operate the bus; orb. Give up the contract at the end of the year or sooner if allowed by the district; orc. Find a new contractor which will meet the criteria.(4) In the event the contractor cannot reach agreement with another party which meets the criteria and is acceptable to the school district, the district may use the process identified in subsection (a) of this section to find a new contractor. In the event that the bus associated with the transportation contract is less than 7 years old and still on the depreciation schedule in the transportation formula, the district shall require that the new contractor make an offer to purchase the bus of the current contractor at least at fair market value as described in a national publication. It shall not be mandatory for the current contractor to accept this offer.(5) No contract shall be deemed effectively transferred until said transfer is approved by the local board of education and the Department of Education.(d) (1) The Department of Education is authorized to obtain from all contractors currently providing pupil transportation a letter of commitment to provide such service for the following school year. Such letters shall be signed by the contractor and shall legally bind the contractor to provide pupil transportation service in the following school year contingent upon the enactment into law of the succeeding fiscal year’s budget appropriation act. A contractor shall not be bound by its letter of commitment should the final budget appropriation act include an inflation factor for the school transportation formula that is less than the inflation factor included in the Governor’s proposed budget presented in January of that year.(2) Failure to sign a letter of commitment shall be interpreted to mean that the contractor does not wish to continue providing pupil transportation services and that an alternative provider shall be found to assume the responsibilities of the existing contractor for the next school year.(3) The letter of commitment shall be considered an offer of renewal as referenced in subsection (a) of this section. Subsection (b) of this section shall apply to contracts that expire due to the failure of a contractor to sign a letter of commitment.(4) The Department of Education is hereby authorized to obtain letters of commitment on or before August 1, 1991, for the school year 1991-1992. In all subsequent years the Department of Education is authorized to obtain letters of commitment on or before May 1.62 Del. Laws, c. 292,\n\n§\n\n 1;63 Del. Laws, c. 184,\n\n§\n\n 1;66 Del.

Transportation of certain pupils.Each local board of education shall adopt and enforce rules and regulations whereby a parent or guardian may elect to waive bus transportation for that parent’s or guardian’s student to and from school in favor of another form of transportation. The principal of each school may issue passes for school bus transportation to certain pupils who have chosen to drive a private vehicle, for use on a temporary and emergency basis; and may also set aside a specific number of parking spaces for use on a temporary and emergency basis by pupils who originally chose transportation by school bus. Any contract between the Department of Education and a supplier of bus transportation, or between a local school board and a supplier of bus transportation, shall be based upon the number of students who elect to be transported by bus, and shall not be based upon the total number of students in the school or school district.67 Del. Laws, c. 49,\n\n§\n\n 2;71 Del. Laws, c. 180,\n\n§\n\n 142;77 Del. Laws, c. 327,\n\n§\n\n 361;§\n\n2910. School bus drivers; drug and alcohol testing.(a) In order to coordinate state and federal efforts to insure the safety of school children, the Department of Education is authorized to contract for a program of drug and alcohol testing services necessary to enable public school districts, charter schools and any person or entity that contracts with a school district or charter school to provide transportation for state public school students to comply with such drug and alcohol testing requirements applicable to Delaware public school bus drivers as are now, or may hereafter be, imposed by federal law. Testing services shall be provided at no cost to the bus driver’s employer. The nature and extent of testing services to be provided shall be at the discretion of the Department of Education, but shall include pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, random and post-accident testing for alcohol and controlled substances pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 31306 and the implementing regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation of the United States pursuant thereto, as the same may from time to time subsequently be amended. In no event shall the Department of Education be responsible for the provision of any post-testing services either to a bus driver or to the driver’s employer except to cause the results of such testing to be provided to the driver and to the driver’s employer.(b) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to impose any additional obligation upon the employer of a public school bus driver beyond those obligations otherwise imposed upon such employer by state or federal law, or pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.(c) No person shall operate a public school bus while not in compliance with the provisions of all federal drug and alcohol testing requirements relevant to the drivers of Delaware public school buses and any regulations adopted by the Department of Education pursuant to this section.(d) The Department of Education is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this section, including, without limitation, rules and regulations which:(1) Require all employers of public school bus drivers in this State to participate in the testing program contracted for by the Department; and(2) Require public school districts, charter schools and the employers of public school bus drivers to follow such procedures and to maintain such records as the Department deems necessary to insure that public school bus drivers are being tested in accordance with the provisions of federal drug and alcohol testing requirements.(e) This section does not impose any additional obligations on a school district, charter school, or the Delaware Transit Corporation with a contract under § 2901(c) of this title beyond those obligations otherwise imposed upon the Delaware Transit Corporations under federal and state law.69 Del. Laws, c. 371,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;71 Del. Laws, c. 180,\n\n§\n\n 143;73 Del. Laws, c. 406,\n\n§\n\n 1;82 Del. Laws, c. 188,\n\n§\n\n4;§\n\n2911. Safety standards for other vehicles.(a) After July 1, 1998, newly purchased and newly leased vehicles with a rated capacity, as defined by the manufacturer, to carry more than 10 passengers in addition to the driver that are used to transport preprimary, primary, and secondary pupils between home and school or to school-related events shall meet state and federal specifications and safety standards applicable to school buses. Contract charter buses meeting federal DOT standards may be used for field trips.(b) This section does not impose any additional obligations on a school district, charter school, or the Delaware Transit Corporation with a contract under § 2901(c) of this title beyond those obligations otherwise imposed upon the Delaware Transit Corporations under federal and state law.71 Del. Laws, c. 354,\n\n§\n\n 379;82 Del. Laws, c. 188,\n\n§\n\n5;",
