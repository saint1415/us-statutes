The report shall be due on or before the last day of the month following the close of each period and with such statement the inspection fee shall be filed according to the rate set forth in subsection (a) of this section.(2) If the tonnage report is not filed and the payment of inspection fee is not made within 30 days after the end of each period, a surcharge equal to 10%, with a minimum of $10, per month of the amount shall be assessed against the registrant, and the Department shall have a lien against the registrant for the amount owed, including surcharge.(c) When more than 1 person is involved in the distribution of a commercial fertilizer or soil conditioner, the last person who has the fertilizer or soil conditioner registered and who distributes to a nonregistrant dealer or consumer, is responsible for reporting the tonnage and paying the inspection fee, unless the report and payment have already been submitted by a prior distributor of a fertilizer or soil conditioner.(d) The Department may not disclose publicly any information furnished under this section in such a way as to divulge confidential information about the business operation of anyone.(e) Fees collected under this section must be used for the payment of the costs of inspection, sampling, and analysis, and other expenses necessary for the administration of this chapter.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2106;58 Del. Laws, c. 157;83 Del. Laws, c. 140,\n\n§\n\n1;83 Del. Laws, c. 283,\n\n§\n\n2;§\n\n2107. Inspection; sampling; analysis.(a) It shall be the duty of the Secretary to sample, inspect, and test commercial fertilizers or soil conditioners distributed within this State at any time and place and to such an extent as the Secretary may deem necessary to determine whether such commercial fertilizers or soil conditioners are in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The Secretary, individually or through the Secretary’s agent, is authorized to enter upon any public or private premises or carriers during regular business hours in order to have access to commercial fertilizers or soil conditioners subject to the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations pertaining thereto, and to the records relating to their distribution; provided, however, that the action of the Secretary or the Secretary’s agent hereunder shall be with the consent of the person having control over the property in which such fertilizer or soil conditioner is kept, and if without such consent, then the Secretary or the Secretary’s agent is to obtain a valid search warrant therefor, specifying the premises to be searched and the purpose of the search, and setting forth probable cause.(b) The methods of analysis and sampling shall be those adopted by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists International. In cases not covered by such methods, or in cases where methods are available in which improved applicability has been demonstrated, the Secretary may adopt such appropriate methods from other sources.(c) The Secretary, in determining for administrative purposes whether any commercial fertilizer is deficient in plant food, shall be guided solely by the “official sample” as defined in § 2103 of this title, and obtained and analyzed as provided for in subsection (b) of this section.(d) The results of official analysis of commercial fertilizers or soil conditioners and portions of official samples shall be distributed by the Secretary as provided in the regulations.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2107;58 Del. Laws, c. 157;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;83 Del. Laws, c. 140,\n\n§\n\n1;84 Del. Laws, c. 42,\n\n§§\n\n1, 16;§\n\n2108. Plant food deficiency.(a) If analysis shows that a commercial fertilizer is deficient in 1 or more of its guaranteed primary plant foods (NPK) beyond the “investigational allowances” as established by published regulation, or if the overall index value of the fertilizer is below the level established by regulation, a penalty of 2.3 times the commercial value (as defined in § 2109 of this title) of such deficiency(s) shall be assessed. When a fertilizer is subject to a penalty under both, the larger penalty payment shall apply.(b) Deficiencies beyond the investigational allowances as established by regulation as provided in subsection (a) of this section in any other constituent(s) covered under § 2103(8)b., c., and d. of this title, which the registrant is required to or may guarantee, shall be evaluated and penalties prescribed therefor by the Secretary by published regulation.(c) All penalties assessed under this section shall be paid to the consumer of the lot of commercial fertilizer represented by the sample analyzed within 3 months after the date of notice from the Secretary to the registrant, receipts taken therefor and promptly forwarded to the Secretary. If said consumers cannot be found, the amount of the penalty shall be paid to the Department which shall deposit same in the General Fund.(d) A deficiency in an official sample of mixed fertilizer resulting from nonuniformity is not distinguishable from a deficiency due to actual plant nutrient shortage and is properly subject to official action.3 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 2108;58 Del. Laws, c. 157;67 Del. Laws, c. 260,\n\n§\n\n 1;83 Del. Laws, c. 140,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n2109.
