      "text": "Section 33-17-2\n\nLegislative Intent; Construction of Chapter.\n\nThe Legislature hereby makes the findings of facts and declaration of intent hereinafter set forth in this section. The construction of a navigable waterway between Demopolis, Alabama and the Tennessee River, utilizing the channel of the Tombigbee River, would provide a new transportation route of great importance and would stimulate the development of commerce, agriculture and industry in many sections of the state. Local flooding along the tributary streams of the Tombigbee River occurs frequently in the growing and harvesting season and causes considerable damage to agriculture in the affected sections of the state. Improvements in the channels of the tributary streams will eliminate much of the damage caused by flooding and will also permit improved farming practices and better land use.\n\nIt is the intention of the Legislature by the passage of this chapter to implement the provisions of Amendment No. 270 of the Constitution of Alabama. In order to further the developments herein found to be beneficial, it is the intention of the Legislature to authorize the formation of a public corporation for the following purposes:\n\n(1) To cooperate with the United States, the State of Alabama, other participating states, counties and municipalities, with all agencies, departments and instrumentalities of such political entities, with the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority, and with private individuals, corporations, associations and other persons in furthering the development of the waterway and the flood control project;\n\n(2) To undertake all obligations and perform all actions that shall be necessary to fulfill the requirements of local contribution, participation and cooperation now established by the United States in connection with the waterway and the flood control project; and\n\n(3) To cooperate generally with the United States, the State of Alabama, other participating states, counties and municipalities, with all agencies, departments and instrumentalities of such political entities, and with the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority in promoting projects in the basin of the Tombigbee River for navigation, water conservation and supply, flood control, irrigation, industrial development, public recreation and related purposes.\n\nIt is further the intention of the Legislature to authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds of the state herein provided for and to empower the said public corporation to supervise the sale of the said bonds and to expend the proceeds of the said bonds in discharging the duties and obligations which the said public corporation is authorized by this chapter to undertake.\n\nThis chapter shall be liberally construed in conformity with its purpose.\n\n(Acts 1967, No. 264, p. 746, §2.)",

Except as hereinafter limited, the bonds may be executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may be in such forms, denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest, or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times, may be payable at such place or places within or without the state, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable and evidenced in such manner, may contain provisions for redemption at the option of the authority at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or prices, and may contain such other provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, all as shall be provided by the board of directors in the resolution or resolutions whereunder the bonds are issued. The principal of each series of the bonds shall mature in annual installments in such amounts as shall be specified in the resolution or resolutions of the board of directors under which they are issued, the first of which installments shall mature not later than one year after the date of the bonds of such series and the last of which installments shall mature not later than 20 years after the date of the bonds of the same series.

Notice of each bond sale shall be given by the authority by publication in either a financial journal or a financial newspaper published in New York, New York, and also by publication in a newspaper published in the State of Alabama, each of which notices must be published at least one time not less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the sale. The authority shall cause such other publicity to be given of each bond sale as it may deem advisable, and it shall fix the terms and conditions under which each sale of bonds may be held; provided, that such terms and conditions shall not conflict with any of the requirements of this chapter.

Such approval shall be entered on the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors at which the bonds are authorized, and shall be signed by the Governor. Such approval by the Governor may be shown on any such bonds by a facsimile of his signature printed or otherwise reproduced thereon when authorization thereof is contained in the said approval signed by him.\n\nThe bonds shall be executed in the name of the state by the Governor, and the Great Seal of the State, or a facsimile thereof, shall be affixed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and attested by the Secretary of State. A facsimile of the signature of either, but not of both, of said officials may be printed or otherwise reproduced on any of the bonds in lieu of being manually inscribed thereon.

Any facsimile of the Great Seal of the State so used shall be valid in all respects as if the Great Seal of the State had been manually affixed to the bonds. In the event any official who shall sign the bonds or the facsimile of whose signature shall appear thereon shall thereafter cease to hold office before they are delivered and paid for, the bonds and the coupons applicable thereto shall nevertheless be valid for all purposes to the same extent as if the official who signed the bonds or the facsimile of whose signature appears thereon had remained in office until all of the bonds bearing such signature or facsimile thereof shall have been delivered and paid for.\n\nThe bonds and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation in the state.\n\n(Acts 1967, No. 264, p. 746, §12.)",
