      "text": "Section 33-8-1\n\nAuthorization; Provisions Generally; Legislative Approval and Ratification.\n\nThe Governor on behalf of this state is hereby authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with the State of Mississippi; and the Legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact, which compact is as follows:\n\nTOMBIGBEE-TENNESSEE WATERWAY DEVELOPMENT COMPACT\n\nArticle I. The purpose of this compact is to promote the development of a navigable waterway connecting the Tennessee and Tombigbee Rivers by way of the east fork of the Tombigbee River and Mackeys and Yellow Creeks so as to provide a nine-foot navigable channel from the junction of the Tombigbee and Warrior rivers at Demopolis in the State of Alabama to the junction of Yellow Creek with the Tennessee River at Pickwick Pool in the State of Mississippi, and to establish a joint interstate authority to assist in these efforts.\n\nArticle II. This compact shall become effective immediately as to the states ratifying it whenever the States of Alabama and Mississippi have ratified it and Congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the Legislature of each of the member states.\n\nArticle III. The states which are parties to this compact (hereinafter referred to as “party states”) do hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “authority”). The membership of which authority shall consist of the governor of each party state and five other citizens of each party state, to be appointed by the Governor thereof. Each appointive member of the authority shall be a citizen of that state who is interested in the promotion and development of waterways and water transportation. The appointive members of the authority shall serve for terms of four years each. Vacancies on the authority shall be filled by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The members of the authority shall not be compensated, but each shall be entitled to actual expenses incurred in attending meetings, or incurred otherwise in the performance of his duties as a member of the authority. The members of the authority shall hold regular quarterly meetings and such special meetings as its business may require. They shall choose annually a chairman and vice-chairman from among their members, and the chairmanship shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. The secretary of the authority (hereinafter provided for) shall notify each member in writing of all meetings of the authority in such a manner and under such rules and regulations as the authority may prescribe. The authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business; and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business, and shall furnish a copy thereof to each member of the authority. It shall be the duty of the authority, in general, to promote, encourage and coordinate the efforts of the party states to secure the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Toward this end, the authority shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits and other matters associated with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift or otherwise, and hold and dispose of such money and property as may be provided for the proper performance of their function; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional or national, having an interest in waterways development; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the congress of the United States and other appropriate officers and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties in connection with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway and to carry out the purposes of this compact.\n\nArticle IV. The authority shall appoint a secretary, who shall be a person familiar with the nature, procedures and significance of inland waterways development and the informational, educational and publicity methods of stimulating general interest in such developments, and who shall be the compact administrator. His term of office shall be at the pleasure of the authority and he shall receive such compensation as the authority shall prescribe. He shall maintain custody of the authority’s books, records and papers, which he shall keep at the office of the authority, and he shall perform all functions and duties, and exercise all powers and authorities, that may be delegated to him by the authority.\n\nArticle V. Each party state agrees that, when authorized by its Legislature, it will from time to time make available and pay over to the authority such funds as may be required for the establishment and operation of the authority. The contribution of each party state shall be in the proportion that its population bears to the total population of the states which are parties hereto, as shown by the most recent official report of the United States bureau of the census, or upon such other basis as may be agreed upon.\n\nArticle VI. Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other waterway project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.\n\nArticle VII. This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until the Legislature or Governor of each or either state takes action to withdraw therefrom; provided, that such withdrawal shall not become effective until six months after the date of the action taken by the Legislature or Governor. Notice of such action shall be given to the other party state or states by the Secretary of State of the party state which takes such action.\n\n(Acts 1957, No. 355, p. 467, §1.)",
