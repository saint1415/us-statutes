The office shall maintain in the files of the office the date and time of delivery of the application to the office.\n\n(f) If a secured party assigns a perfected security interest in a vessel, the receipt by the office of a statement providing the name of the assignee as secured party is not required to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees from the original debtor.
