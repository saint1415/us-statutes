The construction of a navigable waterway between Montgomery and Gadsden and to the Alabama-Georgia boundary, utilizing the channel of the Coosa River, would provide a new transportation route of great importance and would stimulate the development of commerce, agriculture and industry in many sections of the state. It is the intention of the Legislature by the passage of this chapter to implement the provisions of Amendment No. 287 of the Constitution of Alabama. In order to further the developments herein found to be beneficial, it is the intention of the Legislature to authorize the formation of a public corporation for the following purposes:\n\n(1) To cooperate with the United States, the State of Alabama, other participating states, counties and municipalities, with all agencies, departments and instrumentalities of such political entities, and with private individuals, corporations, associations and other persons in furthering the development of the waterway project;\n\n(2) To undertake all obligations and perform all actions that shall be necessary to fulfill the requirements of local contribution, participation and cooperation now, or hereafter, established by the United States in connection with the waterway project;\n\n(3) To cooperate generally with the United States, the State of Alabama, other participating states, counties and municipalities, with all agencies, departments and instrumentalities of such political entities, in promoting projects in the basin of the Coosa River for navigation, water conservation and supply, flood control, irrigation, industrial development, public recreation and related purposes.\n\nIt is further the intention of the Legislature to authorize the issuance of general obligation bonds of the state herein provided for and to empower the said public corporation to supervise the sale of the said bonds and to expend the proceeds of the said bonds in discharging the duties and obligations which the said public corporation is authorized by this chapter to undertake. Nothing herein is intended to authorize such public corporation to engage in or finance, directly or indirectly, the production, transmission, distribution or sale of electric power or to acquire by purchase, license, lease, condemnation or otherwise a hydroelectric project, or any part thereof, now or hereafter licensed by the federal power commission under the Federal Power Act of June 10, 1920, Public Law No. 280, 66th Congress, 2nd Session, and amendments thereto. Likewise nothing herein is intended to authorize such public corporation to engage in or finance, directly or indirectly, the organization or operation of any irrigation district or similar irrigation authority.\n\nThis chapter shall be liberally construed in conformity with its purpose.\n\n(Acts 1969, No. 186, p. 491, §2.)",

Such approval by the Governor may be shown on any such bonds by a facsimile of his signature printed or otherwise reproduced thereon when authorization thereof is contained in the said approval signed by him.\n\nThe bonds shall be executed in the name of the state by the Governor, and the Great Seal of the State, or a facsimile thereof, shall be affixed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and attested by the Secretary of State.
