The said resolution of the board or the said trust indenture may provide for the filing for record in the office of the probate judge of each county in which any part of such property and facilities, or either, may be located of a notice containing a brief description of such property and facilities, or either, a brief description of such bonds, and a declaration that said statutory mortgage lien has been created for the benefit of the holders of such bonds and the interest coupons applicable thereto, upon such property and facilities, or either, including any additions thereto and extensions thereof. Each probate judge shall receive, record and index any such notice filed for record in his office. The recording of such notice, as herein provided, shall operate as constructive notice of the contents thereof.\n\ng. All moneys derived from the sale of any bonds issued by the agency shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes for which the same are authorized and any costs and expenses incidental thereto. Such costs and expenses may include but shall not be limited to:\n\n1. The fiscal, engineering, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the bonds,\n\n2. In the case of bonds issued to pay costs of construction, interest on such bonds (or, if a part only of any series of bonds is issued for construction purposes, interest on that portion of the bonds of that series that is issued to pay construction costs) prior to and during such construction and for not exceeding one year after completion of such construction, and\n\n3. In the case of bonds issued for the purpose of refunding principal and interest, or either, with respect to bonds issued by the agency, any premium that it may be necessary to pay in order to redeem or retire the bonds or other obligations to be refunded.\n\n(6) EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION, ETC. The agency, the property and income of the agency, all bonds issued by the agency, the income from such bonds, conveyances by or to the agency and leases, mortgages and deeds of trust by or to the agency shall be exempt from all taxation in the State of Alabama.
