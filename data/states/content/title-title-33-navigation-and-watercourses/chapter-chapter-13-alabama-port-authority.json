The bonds hereby authorized shall be general obligations of the state, and the full faith, credit and taxing powers of the state are hereby irrevocably pledged for the prompt and faithful payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon.\n\nThe bonds may be sold from time to time as the board of directors may deem advantageous; provided, that no bonds (other than refunding bonds) may be sold or issued unless the Governor shall have first determined that the issuance of the bonds proposed to be issued will be necessary to enable the authority to promote, develop, construct, improve, expand and modernize the state docks facilities. Except as hereinafter limited, the bonds may be executed and delivered at any time and from time to time, may be in such forms, denominations, series and numbers, may be of such tenor and maturities, may bear such date or dates, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest, or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times, may be payable at such place or places within or without the state, may bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding eight percent per annum payable and evidenced in such manner, may contain provisions for redemption at the option of the authority at such date or dates prior to their maturity and upon payment of such redemption price or prices and may contain such other provisions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, all as shall be provided by the board of directors in the resolution or resolutions whereunder the bonds are issued. The principal of each series of the bonds shall mature in annual installments in such amounts as shall be specified in the resolution or resolutions of the board of directors under which they are issued, the first of which installments shall mature not later than three years after the date of the bonds of the same series and the last of which installments shall mature not later than 30 years after the date of the bonds of the same series. Any redemption price required to be paid in order to effect any redemption of bonds prior to maturity shall not exceed the face value of each bond redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption and a premium equal to one year’s interest on such bond. Each series of bonds having an installment of principal maturing more than 10 years after the date thereof shall be made subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the state, at the end of the tenth year following their date and semiannually thereafter in such manner as may be specified in the resolution authorizing such series.\n\nNone of the bonds shall be sold for less than its face value plus accrued interest thereon to the date of their delivery, and all of the bonds shall be sold only at public sale, either on sealed bids or at public auction, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to the state computed to the respective maturities of the bonds sold; provided, that if no bid deemed acceptable by the authority is received, all bids may be rejected. Notice of each bond sale shall be given by the authority by publication in either a financial journal or a financial newspaper published in New York, New York, at least one time not less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for the sale. The authority shall cause such other publicity to be given of each bond sale as it may deem advisable, and it shall fix the terms and conditions under which each sale of bonds may be held; provided, that such terms and conditions shall not conflict with any of the requirements of this chapter. The authority is authorized to provide terms and conditions under which any of the bonds may be exchanged for like bonds of other denominations and may be converted from bearer bonds into registered bonds, either as to principal or interest or both as the authority may prescribe, and again converted into bearer bonds, all without the payment of any fee by the holder of any such bonds.\n\nThe bonds shall not be valid unless the Governor shall approve the terms and conditions under which they were authorized by the board to be issued. Such approval shall be entered on the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors at which the bonds are authorized and shall be signed by the Governor. Such approval by the Governor may, but need not, be shown on any such bonds by a facsimile of his signature printed or otherwise reproduced thereon when authorization hereof is contained in the said approval signed by him.\n\nThe bonds shall be executed in the name of the state by the Governor or by the Director of Finance, and the Great Seal of the State, or a facsimile thereof, shall be impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and attested by the Secretary of State. If the bonds are executed by the Director of Finance, such execution shall be approved on the face of the bonds by the Governor. A facsimile of the signature of any of said officials may be printed or otherwise reproduced on any of the bonds in lieu of being manually signed thereon; provided, that the signature of at least one of the said officials shall be manually signed thereon. The coupons evidencing any installments of interest on the bonds shall be executed with a facsimile of the signature of the State Treasurer printed or otherwise reproduced thereon. Each such facsimile of a signature shall be valid in all respects as if the officials the facsimiles of whose signatures are so used had signed the bonds in person. Any signature, whether manual or facsimile, which appears on any of the bonds and which purports to be the signature of the person acting as one of the officials hereinabove specified shall be treated in all respects as if it were the signature (whether manual or facsimile, as the case may be) of that official. The Great Seal of the State so used shall be valid in all respects as if the Great Seal of the State had been manually affixed to the bonds. In the event any official who shall sign the bonds or the facsimile of whose signature shall appear thereon shall thereafter cease to hold office before the bonds are delivered and paid for, the bonds and the coupons applicable thereto shall nevertheless be valid for all purposes to the same extent as if the official who signed the bonds or the facsimile of whose signature appears thereon had remained in office until all of the bonds bearing such signature or facsimile thereof shall have been delivered and paid for.\n\nThe bonds and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation in the state.\n\n(Acts 1975, 2nd Ex.
