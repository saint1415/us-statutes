The appointive members of the authority shall serve for terms of four years each. Vacancies on the authority shall be filled by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The members of the authority shall not be compensated, but each shall be entitled to actual expenses incurred in attending meetings, or incurred otherwise in the performance of his duties as a member of the authority. The members of the authority shall hold regular quarterly meetings and such special meetings as its business may require. They shall choose annually a chairman and vice-chairman from among their members, and the chairmanship shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. The secretary of the authority (hereinafter provided for) shall notify each member in writing of all meetings of the authority in such a manner and under such rules and regulations as the authority may prescribe. The authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business; and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business and shall furnish a copy thereof to each member of the authority. It shall be the duty of the authority, in general, to promote, encourage and coordinate efforts of the party states to secure the development of a deep draft harbor and terminal. Toward this end, the authority shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits and other matters associated with the development of a deep draft harbor and terminal, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift or otherwise, and hold and dispose of such money and property as may be provided for the proper performance of their function; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional or national, having an interest in the development of deep draft harbors and terminals; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the congress of the United States and other appropriate offices and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties in connection with the development of a deep draft harbor and terminal and to carry out the purposes of this compact.\n\nArticle III. The authority shall appoint an executive secretary, who shall be the compact administrator. His term of office shall be at the pleasure of the authority and he shall receive such compensation as the authority shall prescribe. He shall maintain custody of the authority’s books, records and papers, which he shall keep at the office of the authority, and he shall perform all functions and duties, and exercise all powers and authorities, that may be delegated to him by the authority.\n\nArticle IV. Each party state agrees that, when authorized by its Legislature, it will from time to time make available and pay over to the authority such funds as may be required for the establishment and operation of the authority. The contribution of each party state shall be equally shared.\n\nArticle V. Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other harbor or terminal project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.\n\nArticle VI. This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until the Legislature or Governor of each or either state takes action to withdraw therefrom; provided that such withdrawal shall not become effective until six months after the date of the action taken by the Legislature or Governor. Notice of such action shall be given to the other party state or states by the secretary of state of the party state which takes such action.\n\nArticle VII. There is hereby granted to the Governor, to the members of the authority for Alabama and to the compact administrator all the powers provided for in said compact and in this chapter. All officers of the State of Alabama are hereby authorized and directed to do all things falling within their respective jurisdictions which are necessary or incidental to carrying out the purposes of said compact. The members of the authority appointed by the Governor of the State of Alabama under the provisions of Article II of the compact shall be with the advice and consent of the State Senate of Alabama.\n\nArticle VIII. The provisions of this compact are severable. If any part of the compact is declared invalid or unconstitutional, such declaration shall not affect the part which remains.\n\nArticle IX. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its passage and approval by the Governor, or upon its otherwise becoming a law.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1065, p. 1784.)",
