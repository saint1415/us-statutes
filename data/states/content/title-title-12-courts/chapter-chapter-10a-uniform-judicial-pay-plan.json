      "text": "Section 12-10A-1\n\nCompensation of Judges - Uniform Plan.\n\n(a) In recognition of the disparity in compensation of circuit and district judges caused by varying amounts of local supplements to state salaries and the need for a uniform plan of compensation, the following comprehensive plan is adopted for the compensation of judges. This plan, when implemented, shall reward judges for judicial experience and phase out local salary supplements and expense allowances.\n\n(1) On October 1, 2000, the salary of circuit judges paid from the State Treasury shall be increased to the amount authorized for attorneys in the classified service of the state as Attorney IV, step 14, on June 10, 1999, and the salary of the Supreme Court Justices, judges of the appellate courts, and district judges shall be adjusted correspondingly as provided by Act 90-111, 1990 Regular Session (Acts 1990, p. 132).\n\n(2) On October 1, 2001, the salary of circuit judges paid from the State Treasury shall be increased to the amount authorized for attorneys in the classified service of the state as Attorney IV, step 17, on June 10, 1999, and the salary of the Supreme Court Justices, judges of the appellate courts, and district judges shall be adjusted correspondingly as provided by Act 90-111, 1990 Regular Session (Acts 1990, p. 132).\n\n(3) On October 1, 2002, the salaries of the circuit judges paid from the State Treasury shall be fixed at one thousand dollars ($1,000) above the maximum amount authorized on June 10, 1999, for attorneys in the classified service of the state as Attorney IV, and the salary of Supreme Court Justices, judges of the appellate courts, and district judges shall be adjusted correspondingly as provided by Act 90-111, 1990 Regular Session (Acts 1990, p. 132).\n\nThe salaries of circuit judges shall not be increased above the amounts provided in this chapter as the result of any increases in the salaries of Attorneys IV which may occur after June 10, 1999.\n\n(b) A circuit or district judge, Supreme Court Justice, or judge of an appellate court may not receive a cost-of-living raise during fiscal year 2000-2001, 2001-2002, or 2002-2003, other than an increase as provided by this chapter and Act 90-111, 1990 Regular Session (Acts 1990, p. 132).\n\n(c) A circuit or district judge who is first elected or appointed after October 1, 2001, shall be paid compensation only from the State Treasury, and may not receive any salary supplement or expense allowance, or both, from any county.\n\n(d)(1) Effective October 1, 2000, all circuit and district judges shall receive as additional compensation from the state the base salary provided in subsection (a) plus the appropriate amount for bench experience calculated pursuant to subdivision (2). Any salary supplement or expense allowance being paid by a county commission on September 30, 2000, to a sitting judge shall be diminished on October 1, 2000, and each October 1 thereafter, by the amount that the judge receives from the state for his or her bench experience as provided in subdivision (2). No salary supplement or expense allowance may increase after June 10, 1999.\n\n(2) Effective October 1, 2000, the salary of circuit judges, district judges, Supreme Court Justices, and judges of the appellate courts shall be increased by 1.25 percent for every year that they have served as judges or justices of a state court to a maximum of 25 percent of the base salary.\n\n(3) Any local salary supplement or expense allowance paid to a circuit or district judge shall be reduced by the amount of any increase in compensation brought about by virtue of the bench experience provision in subdivision (2).\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d), no circuit judge, district judge, Supreme Court Justice, or judge of the appellate courts shall have his or her salary increased for bench experience after May 26, 2004.\n\n(f) Effective April 23, 2006, notwithstanding subsection (e), the provisions of subsection (d), which provide for additional compensation based on bench experience are reinstated, as they apply to circuit and district judges only.\n\n(Act 99-427, p. 759, §4; Act 2004-636, p. 1452, §4; Act 2015-316, §1(b)(3); Act 2015-368, §1(b)(3).)",
