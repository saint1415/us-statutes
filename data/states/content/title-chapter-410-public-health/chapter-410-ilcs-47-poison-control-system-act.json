      "text": "The General Assembly finds and\ndeclares that it is in the public interest to reduce the incidence,\nseverity, and expenditures associated with the accidental, intentional, and\nenvironmental poisoning of children, adults, and animals; to educate the\npublic and health professionals concerning the prevention and treatment of\nhazardous exposures; and to ensure that adequate poison control services\nare available on a statewide basis. The General Assembly believes that the\npeople of the State of Illinois will benefit from the provision of poison\ncontrol activities because these activities will reduce the number of\naccidental poisonings, provide immediate medical information, and lower health\ncare costs. In addition, poison control activities will reduce the number of\ndeaths, reduce emotional stress, promote faster recovery, and provide more cost\neffective treatment for poisoning exposures. The General Assembly also finds\nthat a statewide poison control system covering human and animal exposures can\nutilize animal exposures as monitors of environmental quality and human risk,\nprovide for a complete epidemiological surveillance of poisoning, reduce the\neconomic impact from livestock loss due to poisoning and help maintain a safe\nfood supply, and avoid duplication of services and waste. A statewide system\nwill also increase preparedness for toxicological disasters and provide\nantidote depots. It is the purpose of this Act to establish a comprehensive,\nstatewide regional poison control system so that any person may obtain expert\nhazard, toxicology, and treatment information on a 24 hours basis.",

The 2-year period shall automatically\nbe extended for an additional 2 years if funding was not secured after a\npoison control center's initial designation. The designated departments shall\nset standards of operation after consulting with current poison control service\nproviders. Poison control centers shall cooperate to reduce the cost of\noperations, collect information on poisoning exposures, and provide education\nto the public and health professionals. A regional poison control center shall\ncontinue to operate unless it voluntarily closes or the designating departments\nrevoke the designation for failure to comply with the standards. Centers\ndesignated under this Act shall be considered State agencies for purposes of\nthe State Employee Indemnification Act.",
