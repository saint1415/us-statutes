The General Assembly recognizes that peaceful primary picketing of any type is explicitly permitted by statute pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq., and the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq., including the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection as provided in 29 U.S.C. 157 et seq.",

It is declared to be the policy of this State that the regulation of picketing is an exclusive power and function of the State. A home rule unit may not regulate picketing. This Section is a denial and limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.",
