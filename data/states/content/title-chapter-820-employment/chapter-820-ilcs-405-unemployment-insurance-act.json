Poverty, distress and\nsuffering have prevailed throughout the State because funds have not been\naccumulated in times of plentiful opportunities for employment for the\nsupport of unemployed workers and their families during periods of\nunemployment, and the taxpayers have been unfairly burdened with the cost\nof supporting able-bodied workers who are unable to secure employment.\nFarmers and rural communities particularly are unjustly burdened with\nincreased taxation for the support of industrial workers at the very time\nwhen agricultural incomes are reduced by lack of purchasing power in the\nurban markets. It is the considered judgment of the General Assembly that\nin order to lessen the menace to the health, safety and morals of the\npeople of Illinois, and to encourage stabilization of employment,\ncompulsory unemployment insurance upon a statewide scale providing for\nthe setting aside of reserves during periods of employment to be used to\npay benefits during periods of unemployment, is necessary.",
