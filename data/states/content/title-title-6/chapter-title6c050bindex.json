Express warranties.(a) A manufacturer who sells or leases a new assistive technology device to a consumer, either directly or through an assistive technology device dealer or lessor, shall furnish the consumer with an express warranty that the assistive technology device will be free from any defect or condition that substantially impairs the use, value or safety of the assistive technology device. The duration of the express warranty must not be less than 1 year after first possession of the assistive technology device by the consumer. The duration of the express warranty shall be reasonably extended by any period of time during which repair services or replacement parts are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion, or strike, fire, flood, or other natural disaster.(b) If a new assistive technology device does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, the assistive technology device lessor, or any of the manufacturer’s authorized assistive technology device dealers and makes the assistive technology device available for repair before 1 year after first possession of the device by the consumer, the nonconformity must be repaired or replaced at no cost to the consumer.(c) If a manufacturer fails to furnish an express warranty as required by this section, the assistive technology device shall be covered by an express warranty as if the manufacturer had furnished an express warranty to the consumer as required by this section.(d) A manufacturer may provide any express warranty in addition to the express warranty required by this section; provided, however, that no term of any additional express warranty is inconsistent with, or in any way limits the applicability of, the warranty required by this section.74 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5003B. Notice to consumer.At the time of purchase the manufacturer must provide directly to the consumer a statement, written in 10-point all capital type on a separate piece of paper or in such other form as the consumer can understand, in substantially the following form:“IMPORTANT: IF THIS DEVICE IS DEFECTIVE, YOU MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER STATE LAW TO REPLACEMENT OF IT OR A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE. HOWEVER, TO BE ENTITLED TO REFUND OR REPLACEMENT, YOU MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE MANUFACTURER, ITS AGENT OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALER OF THE PROBLEM AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR THE DEVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TITLE 6, CHAPTER 50B.”74 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5004B. Replacement or refund.(a) If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, a nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall, at the direction of the consumer, do 1 of the following:(1) Accept return of the assistive technology device and within 30 days refund to the consumer and to a holder of a perfected security interest in the consumer’s assistive technology device, as their interest may appear, the full purchase price plus any finance charge, amount paid by the consumer at the point of sale and collateral costs; or(2) Accept return of the assistive technology device, refund to the assistive technology device lessor and to a holder of a perfected security interest in the assistive technology device, as their interest may appear, the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer the amount that the consumer paid under the written lease plus collateral costs; or(3) Accept return of the assistive technology device upon delivery to the consumer of a comparable new assistive technology device.(b) To receive a comparable new assistive technology device, a consumer shall offer to transfer possession of the nonconforming assistive technology device to the manufacturer. No later than 30 days after that offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with the comparable new assistive technology device. When the manufacturer provides the new assistive technology device, the consumer shall return the assistive technology device having the nonconformity to the manufacturer, at the manufacturer’s expense, along with any endorsements necessary to transfer real possession to the manufacturer.(c) For the purposes of this section, the current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which that lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus the assistive technology device dealer’s early termination costs and the value of the assistive technology device at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the assistive technology device lessor’s early termination savings.(d) No person may enforce the lease against the consumer after the consumer receives a refund.74 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5005B. Nonconformity disclosure requirement.No assistive technology device returned by a consumer or assistive technology device lessor in this State or another state may be sold or leased in this State unless full disclosure of the reason for return is made to a prospective buyer or lessee.74 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5006B. Availability of other remedies; waivers void; additional relief.(a) This chapter does not limit rights or remedies which are otherwise available under any uniform commercial code, consumer protection statute, or any other applicable law or regulation.(b) A waiver of rights by a consumer under this chapter is void.(c) In addition to pursuing other remedies, a consumer may bring an action to recover damages for any damages caused by a violation of this chapter. The court shall award a consumer who prevails in the action twice the amount of any pecuniary loss, together with costs, disbursements, reasonable attorney’s fees, and any equitable relief that the court may determine is appropriate.74 Del. Laws, c. 278,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n5007B. Replacement during repair; reimbursement of rental costs incurred by consumer; penalties.(a) Whenever an assistive technology device covered by a manufacturer’s express warranty is tendered by a consumer to the manufacturer, assistive technology lessor, or authorized assistive technology dealer from whom it was purchased or exchanged for the repair of a defect, malfunction, or nonconformity to which the warranty is applicable and at least 1 of the following conditions exists, the manufacturer shall provide directly to the consumer for the duration of the repair period, a replacement assistive technology device or reimbursement for the cost incurred by the consumer for renting a replacement assistive technology device. The applicable conditions are as follows:(1) The repair period exceeds 10 working days, including the day on which the device is tendered to the dealer for repair; or(2) The defect, malfunction, or nonconformity is the same for which the assistive technology device has been tendered to the dealer for repair on at least 2 previous occasions.(b) This section applies for the duration of the manufacturer’s express warranty and any extension thereof.74 Del.
