The dollar amount must be rounded to the nearest $100, except that the amounts in § 2423A of this title must be rounded to the nearest dollar.(g) The Attorney General shall notify licensed providers of any change in dollar amounts made pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and make that information available to the public.(h) The Attorney General may adopt such regulations, not inconsistent herewith, as the Attorney General may deem necessary or appropriate in the administration, interpretation and enforcement of this chapter. Subchapter II of the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29 shall apply to the procedures for adopting such regulations.75 Del. Laws, c. 430,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2433A. Administrative remedies.(a) In addition to any other enforcement method specified in this Code, the Attorney General may enforce this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter by taking one or more of the following actions:(1) Ordering a provider or a director, employee, or other agent of a provider to cease and desist from any violations;(2) Ordering a provider or a person that has caused a violation to correct the violation, including making restitution of money or property to a person aggrieved by a violation;(3) Imposing on a provider or a person that has caused a violation a civil penalty not exceeding $50,000 for each violation;(4) Prosecuting a civil action to:(A) Enforce an order; or(B) Obtain restitution or an injunction or other equitable relief, or both;(5) Intervening in an action brought under § 2435A of this title.(b) If a person violates or knowingly authorizes, directs, or aids in the violation of a final order issued under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the Attorney General may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $75,000 for each violation.(c) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to impose under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall consider the seriousness of the violation, the good faith of the violator, any previous violations by the violator, the deleterious effect of the violation on the public, the net worth of the violator, and any other factor the Attorney General considers relevant to the determination of the civil penalty.(d) Any civil penalty imposed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.(e) Service of any notice or order issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or subsection (b) of this section may be effected in any manner that is allowed for service of a complaint in the Superior Court of this State.(f) The Attorney General may recover from the violator all reasonable costs of enforcing this chapter under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, including attorney’s fees based on the hours reasonably expended and the hourly rates for attorneys of comparable experience in the community, and also including the compensation of all employees of the Attorney General’s office based on the time they reasonably expended on the matter.(g) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, an order issued under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or subsection (b) of this section shall not become effective less than 10 days after the order is served. After an order is served, but before its effective date, any interested party may petition the Attorney General for a hearing. At the conclusion of such hearing, the Attorney General may affirm the order as originally issued, or modify, amend or rescind the order.(2) Whenever in the opinion of the Attorney General, the violation that is the subject of an order under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section represents an immediate danger or substantial harm to the interests of any person aggrieved by a violation or the public, or where such violation or its continuance is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of the assets of a provider, the Attorney General may issue an order which shall become effective immediately upon service, without prior notice or hearing. Upon application of any interested party, the Attorney General shall afford an opportunity for a hearing to consider rescission of that order or any action taken promptly thereafter.(3) Upon receipt of a hearing request, the Attorney General shall conduct a proceeding pursuant to subchapter III of the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, any final order under this section will be a public record.75 Del. Laws, c. 430,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2434A. Suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of license.(a) In this section “insolvent” means:(1) Having generally ceased to pay debts in the ordinary course of business other than as a result of good-faith dispute;(2) Being unable to pay debts as they become due; or(3) Being insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., as amended.(b) The Attorney General may suspend, revoke, or deny renewal of a provider’s license if:(1) A fact or condition exists that, if it had existed when the licensed provider applied for its provider license, would have been a reason for denying the license;(2) The provider has committed a material violation of this chapter or a rule or order of the Attorney General under this chapter;(3) The provider is insolvent;(4) The provider or an employee or affiliate of the provider has refused to permit the Attorney General to make an examination authorized by this chapter; or(5) The provider has not responded within a reasonable time and in an appropriate manner to communications from the Attorney General.(c) If a provider does not comply with § 2422A(f) of this title or if the Attorney General otherwise finds that the public health or safety or general welfare requires emergency action, the Attorney General may order a summary suspension of the provider’s license, effective on the date specified in the order.(d) If the Attorney General suspends, revokes, or denies the renewal of a provider license, the Attorney General may seek a court order authorizing seizure of any or all of the money in a trust account required by § 2422A of this title, as well as all books, records, accounts, and other property of the provider which are located in this State.(e) If the Attorney General makes a preliminary determination to suspend or revoke a provider’s license, the provider may file a request for a hearing with the Attorney General pursuant to subchapter IV of the Delaware Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 101 of Title 29. The Attorney General’s preliminary determination may become a final decision if such a request is not timely filed. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, any final order under this section will be a public record.75 Del. Laws, c. 430,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2435A. Private enforcement.(a) If an individual voids an agreement pursuant to § 2425A(b) of this title, the individual may recover in a civil action all money paid or deposited by or on behalf of the individual pursuant to the agreement, except amounts paid to creditors, in addition to the recovery under paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.(b) If an individual voids an agreement pursuant to § 2425A(a) of this title, the individual may recover in a civil action 3 times the total amount of the fees, charges, money, and payments made by the individual to the provider, in addition to the recovery under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.(c) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, an individual with respect to whom a provider violates this chapter may recover in a civil action from the provider and any person that caused the violation:(1) Compensatory damages for injury, including noneconomic injury, caused by the violation;(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, with respect to a violation of § 2417A, § 2419A, § 2420A, § 2421A, § 2422A, § 2423A, § 2424A, § 2427A, or § 2428A(a), (b), or (d) of this title, the greater of the amount recoverable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or $5,000;(3) Punitive damages; and(4) Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.(d) In a class action, except for a violation of § 2428A(a)(5) of this title, the minimum damages provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section do not apply.(e) In addition to the remedy available under subsection (c) of this section, if a provider violates an individual’s rights under § 2420A of this title, the individual may recover in a civil action all money paid or deposited by or on behalf of the individual pursuant to the agreement, except for amounts paid to creditors.(f) A provider is not liable under this section for a violation of this chapter if the provider proves that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a good-faith error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error. An error of legal judgment with respect to a provider’s obligations under this chapter is not a good-faith error. If in connection with a violation, the provider has received more money than authorized by an agreement or this chapter, the defense provided by this subsection is not available unless the provider refunds the excess within 2 business days of learning of the violation.(g) The Attorney General shall assist an individual in enforcing a judgment against the surety bond or other security provided under § 2413A or § 2414A of this title.75 Del. Laws, c. 430,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2436A. Violation of unfair or deceptive practices statute.If an act or practice of a provider violates both this chapter and Chapter 25 of this title, an individual may not recover under both for the same act or practice.75 Del.

Statute of limitations.(a) An action or proceeding brought pursuant to § 2433A(a), (b), or (c) of this title must be commenced within 4 years after the conduct that is the basis of the Attorney General’s complaint.(b) An action brought pursuant to § 2435A of this title must be commenced within 3 years after the latest of:(1) The individual’s last transmission of money to a provider;(2) The individual’s last transmission of money to a creditor at the direction of the provider;(3) The provider’s last disbursement to a creditor of the individual;(4) The provider’s last accounting to the individual pursuant to § 2427A(a) of this title;(5) The date on which the individual discovered or reasonably should have discovered the facts giving rise to the individual’s claim; or(6) Termination of actions or proceedings by the Attorney General with respect to a violation of the chapter.(c) The period prescribed in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is tolled during any period during which the provider or, if different, the defendant has materially and wilfully misrepresented information required by this chapter to be disclosed to the individual if the information so misrepresented is material to the establishment of the liability of the defendant under this chapter.75 Del. Laws, c. 430,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2438A. Uniformity of application and construction.In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.75 Del.
