During such period, liens or encumbrances shall arise or be created only against each unit in the same manner and under the same conditions in every respect as liens or encumbrances may arise or be created upon or against any other separate parcel of real property subject to individual ownership; provided, that no labor performed or materials furnished with the consent or at the request of a unit owner or his agent, his contractor or subcontractor shall be the basis for the filing of a lien against the unit or any other property of any other unit owner not expressly consenting to or requesting the same, except that such express consent shall be deemed to be given by the owner of any unit in the case of emergency repairs thereto. Labor performed or materials furnished for the common elements and limited common elements, if duly authorized by the association in accordance with this chapter, the declaration, or bylaws, shall be deemed to be performed or furnished with the express consent of each unit owner benefited by such labor or materials and shall be the basis for the filing of a lien pursuant to the lien laws against each of the units so benefited and shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(b) In the event a lien against two or more units becomes effective, the owner of each separate unit may remove his unit from the lien and obtain a discharge and satisfaction by payment of the proportion thereof attributable to such unit. The proportion so attributable to each unit subject to the lien shall be the proportion in which all units subject to the lien share among themselves in liability for common expenses or limited common expenses as appropriate. Subsequent to any such payment, the lien on such unit shall be discharged or otherwise satisfied of record, and the unit shall thereafter be free and clear of such lien. Such partial payment discharge and satisfaction shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce his rights against any other unit not so paid, satisfied, or discharged.\n\n(Acts 1964, 1st Ex. Sess., No. 206, p. 266, §9; Acts 1973, No. 1059, p. 1732, §16.)",

      "text": "Section 35-8-17\n\nLiens in Favor of Association.\n\nThe association shall have a lien on each unit for any unpaid assessment duly made by the association for a share of common expenses, limited common expenses or otherwise, together with interest thereon and, if authorized by the declaration or bylaws, reasonable attorney’s fees. Such lien shall be effective from and after the time of recording in the public records of the county in which the unit is located of a claim of lien stating the description of the unit, the name of the record owner, the amount due, and the date when due. Such claim of lien shall include only sums which are due and payable when the claim of lien is recorded and shall be signed and verified by an officer or agent of the association. Upon full payment of all sums secured by the lien, the party making payment shall be entitled to a recordable satisfaction of lien. All such liens shall be subordinate to any lien for taxes, the lien of any mortgage of record, and any other lien recorded prior to the time of recording of the claim of the association’s lien.\n\n(1) Upon any voluntary conveyance of a unit, the grantor and grantee of such unit shall be jointly and severally liable for all unpaid assessments pertaining to such unit duly made by the association or accrued up to the date of such conveyance without prejudice to the right of the grantee to recover from the grantor any amounts paid by the grantee, but the grantee shall be exclusively liable for those accruing while he is the unit owner.\n\n(2) Any unit owner or any purchaser of a unit prior to completion of a voluntary sale may require from the association a certificate showing the amount of unpaid assessments pertaining to such unit, and the association shall provide such certificate within 10 days after request therefor. The holder of a mortgage or other lien on any unit may request a similar certificate with respect to such unit. Any person other than the unit owner at the time of issuance of any such certificate who relies upon such certificate shall be entitled to rely thereon, and his liability for such unpaid assessments shall be limited to the amounts set forth in such certificate.\n\n(3) If a holder of a first lien of record or other purchaser of a unit obtains title to such unit as a result of foreclosure of the first lien, such acquirer of title, his successors and assigns shall not be fully liable for the share of common expenses, limited common expenses, or other assessments by the association pertaining to such unit or chargeable to the former unit owner which became due prior to acquisition of title as a result of the foreclosure. Such unpaid share of common expenses, limited common expenses, or other assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses or limited common expenses collectable from all of the remaining unit owners including such acquirer, his successors and assigns.\n\n(4) Liens for unpaid assessments may be foreclosed by an action brought in the name of the association in the same manner as a foreclosure of a mortgage on real property. The association shall have the power, unless prohibited by the declaration or bylaws, to bid in the unit at foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the same. An action to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without waiving the lien securing the same.\n\n(Acts 1964, 1st Ex.

The instrument creating any such mortgage shall provide a method whereby any unit owner may obtain a release of his unit from the lien of such mortgage and a satisfaction and discharge in recordable form upon payment to the holder of the mortgage of a sum equal to the proportionate share attributable to his unit of the then outstanding balance of unpaid principal and accrued interest and any other charges then due and unpaid. Such proportionate share attributable to each unit shall be the proportion in which all unit owners whose units are then subject to the lien of the mortgage own among themselves the common elements and limited common elements as provided in the declaration, and the private elements, or such other reasonable proportion as shall be specifically provided in the mortgage instrument. Such mortgage may contain provisions for converting such mortgage to individual mortgages on the individual units included therein. In the event of such conversion, the mortgage on the individual units shall be entitled to recordation without the payment of the mortgage tax provided for by Section 40-22-2.\n\n(Acts 1973, No. 1059, p. 1732, §18.)",

The undivided share in the property owned in common by each such owner with respect to the previous common elements shall be the undivided interest previously owned by such owner in the previous common elements. The undivided share in the property owned in common by each such owner with respect to the previous limited common elements shall be the undivided interest previously owned by each such owner in the previous limited common elements. The undivided share in the property owned in common by each such owner with respect to the previous private elements may be determined by an appraisal of all previous private elements and a computation of the relation that the value of each such owner’s previous private elements bears to the value of all previous private elements or such other reasonable method of determination as the declaration may provide. Under no circumstances shall anyone other than the owner of a unit at the time of removal be entitled to the use of any previous element of such previous unit subsequent to the removal of the condominium property from the provisions of this chapter and prior to the sale of such previous element.\n\n(d) After termination of a condominium in any manner, the liens upon the previous units shall be upon the respective undivided interests of the owners as tenants in common.\n\n(e) The termination of a condominium shall not bar the creation of another condominium affecting all or part of the same property.\n\n(Acts 1964, 1st Ex.
