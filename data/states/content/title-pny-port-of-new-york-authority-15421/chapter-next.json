Such an action or proceeding may be\nbrought in the supreme court, which shall have jurisdiction to grant\nmandamus or injunction or any other relief appropriate to the case.§ 7. The commission, and any member thereof when directed by the\ncommission, may make any investigation which the commission may deem\nnecessary to enable it effectually to carry out the provisions of this\nact, and for that purpose the commission, or such member, may take and\nhear proofs and testimony and compel the attendance of witnesses and the\nproduction of books, papers, records and documents, including public\nrecords. The commission and its authorized agents may enter upon any\nlands as in its judgment may be necessary for the purpose of making\nsurveys and examinations to accomplish any purpose authorized by this\nact, the district being liable for actual damage done.§ 8. In the preparation of its comprehensive plan of port development\nprovided for in this act, the commission shall incorporate existing\nfacilities as an integral part thereof, so far as practicable. If the\ncommission shall determine as part of such plan that the district shall\nconstruct any port facilities or contribute to the cost of such\nfacilities to be constructed by any municipality, the plan shall contain\nspecifications of all such work, estimates of the cost of each and an\nestimate of the total cost, including the cost of acquiring necessary\nreal property; and the total cost of such work, and amount of such\ncontributions shall be borne by all the municipalities in the district,\nexcept as hereinafter provided. The commission also shall make a\ntentative determination and shall annex to and file with such\nspecifications and estimates a statement showing the proportion of\nbenefit to each municipality in the district from such improvements,\nregard being had to the special benefit to the municipality in which any\ndistrict part of such work is to be done, and from the estimated annual\naverage expenditures of the commission, other than for construction\nwork, for a period of three years. Such proportions shall be expressed\nin decimals. The development of such port shall be deemed and is hereby\ndeclared to be a public, municipal purpose of each city, in the\ndistrict, to the extent of the local benefits accruing and to accrue\ntherefrom. Such decimal, with respect to any municipality, shall\nrepresent the proportion of the total cost to be borne by it, and shall\nbe the proportion of the total amount to be raised annually by tax on\nthe taxable property in the municipality of the portion of such cost to\nbe provided annually, of the annual expenses of the commission other\nthan for construction work and contributions to municipal construction,\nand of any installment of principal and interest of any obligation of\nthe district next to become due. At the end of each three year period,\nnew estimates shall be made of the expenses of the commission, other\nthan for construction work and such contributions, for the ensuing three\nyears, and, if necessary, such apportionment shall be revised. It may\nalso be revised if there be subsequent construction work, not\ncontemplated by the original comprehensive plan, by which the relative\nbenefits of the whole work to the several municipalities are altered.\nNotwithstanding, however, any provisions of this act, the entire cost of\nconstruction of any port facilities within the city of Albany or upon\nland owned by said city, including the cost of acquiring the necessary\nreal property therefor, shall be borne by the city of Albany. Before any\napportionment under this section, or revision thereof, shall be deemed\nfinal, the commission shall cause its determination as to such\napportionment to be published in at least two daily newspapers in the\ndistrict, twice in each week for two weeks, and shall therewith give\nnotice of a public hearing on such apportionment, to be held not less\nthan ten days after the last publication. It shall also give notice to\neach municipality by mailing a notice setting forth the time and place\nof such hearing, which said notice shall be mailed to the mayor, and the\ncorporation counsel of each municipality at least ten days before the\nday of such hearing. It shall give such a hearing and the\nrepresentatives of the governing body of a municipality and any taxpayer\nin the district may be heard for or in opposition to such apportionment.\nAfter such hearing the commission shall file in the office of the clerk\nof each such municipality its final determination, either affirming such\noriginal apportionment or modifying it and affirming it as modified.§ 9. The fiscal year of the district shall be from July first to June\nthirtieth, inclusive. Annually, in the month of June, the commission\nshall file with the clerk and with the treasurer of each city in the\ndistrict, a statement of the amount to be raised upon the territory\nwithin such city and paid to the commission, for the estimated\nexpenditures of the commission under this act during such fiscal year,\nincluding construction cost, expenses other than for construction, and\ninstallments of the district debt, if any, and interest, to fall due in\nsuch year. The statement shall specify when the amount shall be paid to\nthe commission which shall, so far as practicable, be after the\ncollection of taxes next to be levied in or for such municipality. The\nclerk of each city shall cause such statement to be presented to the\nlegislative governing body, and board of estimate, if any, of the city,\nat its next meeting, and such board or body shall cause the amount\nchargeable to the several parcels of real estate in the city to be\nlevied upon such real estate in the city by the first annual municipal\ntax levy next occurring, in proportion to the valuation of the taxable\nreal property for city taxes. The amounts chargeable under this section,\nwhen collected, shall be paid to the treasurer of the commission. In\ndetermining the total amount to be raised for any fiscal year under this\nsection the commission shall deduct from its estimate of total\nexpenditures the probable amount of net revenues, if any, from its port\nfacilities, and the amount of any appropriations by the legislature to\nbe available in such year.Prior to the first apportionment of construction cost to the several\nmunicipalities, under this act, and the fixing of the decimal\nrepresenting the proportion of benefit, the expenses of the commission,\nor so much thereof as may not be provided for by state appropriations,\nannually shall be borne by the several cities in the proportion that the\nassessed valuation of the taxable property in the district; and the\nnecessary statement shall be filed with each city clerk, as provided in\nthis section, and the provisions of this section, relative to levy and\ncollection of a tax to pay such amounts shall apply thereto.§ 10. After estimates of the cost of any improvement or improvements\nby the commission under this act shall have been made and after the\napportionment, or any revision or apportionment, covering any such\nimprovement or improvements shall have become final, as provided in this\nact, whereby the proportions to be paid by the real estate in the\nseveral municipalities shall have been determined, the commission may\nprovide moneys for construction of such improvements, in an amount not\nexceeding such estimated cost. Any judicial review of such final\napportionment by the commission, however, shall not delay or prevent the\ncommencement of construction work. Bonds or notes of the district shall\nnot be construed in any event as obligations of the state, and the state\nshall not be obligated to pay the principal or interest, or either.§ 10-A. Subject to the provisions of section three of article eight of\nthe constitution and section six-a of the general municipal law,\nnotwithstanding the provisions of any other general, special or local\nlaws: (a) With the approval of and on terms and conditions prescribed by\nthe state comptroller, the commission may refund the principal of and\nissue bonds of the district to pay the interest on any bonded\nindebtedness or portion thereof contracted before the first day of\nJanuary, nineteen hundred thirty-nine. The consent of the state\ncomptroller shall be executed under his hand and seal in duplicate. One\nof such duplicates shall be filed in the office of the department of\naudit and control and the other in the office of the chief fiscal\nofficer of the commission. Both of such duplicates shall be public\nrecords. All such bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued\npursuant to this section, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of\ntheir validity and of the regularity of the issue. The validity of the\nbonds hereby authorized shall in no wise be affected by the invalidity\nof, or any irregularity in any proceeding authorizing the issuance of,\nthe obligations the principal of or interest on which is to be paid with\nthe proceeds thereof except that bonds shall not be issued to pay the\nprincipal of or interest on bonds of the district adjudged invalid by\nthe final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No bonds issued\npursuant to this section shall be refunded. Such bonds may be authorized\nat any general or special meeting of the commission by the vote of a\nmajority of the commission. Such bonds shall show upon their face that\nthe payment thereof is secured by general tax in the several\nmunicipalities in the Albany Port District under the provisions of this\nact, reciting the title and chapter number hereof, and that the proceeds\nof such tax are hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds. Such bonds\nshall not be construed in any event as bonds or indebtedness of the\nstate, and the state shall not be obligated to pay the principal or\ninterest, or either, nor shall such bonds be considered obligations of\ncities and subject to the provisions of section four of article eight of\nthe constitution of the state of New York. Such bonds shall bear\ninterest at a rate of not exceeding six per centum per annum, payable\nsemi-annually. Such bonds, as issued from time to time, shall be paid in\nannual installments, the first of which shall be payable not more than\nfive years and the last of which shall be payable not later than the\nyear nineteen hundred and sixty-one. None of such installments shall be\nmore than twice the amount of any prior installment. Such bonds shall be\nexempt from taxation except for transfer and inheritance taxes. They\nshall be signed by the chairman of the commission, attested by its\nsecretary and have the seal of the district affixed thereto. The coupons\nshall bear the facsimile signature of the treasurer of the commission.\nThey shall be sold at not less than par. The commission shall sell such\nbonds to the highest bidder after advertisement for a period of five\nconsecutive days, Sundays and holidays excepted, in at least two daily\nnewspapers published in the city of Albany. Advertisements shall contain\na provision to the effect that the commission, in its discretion, may\nreject any or all bids made in pursuance of such advertisement and in\nthe event of such rejection, the commission is authorized to readvertise\nfor bids in the form and manner above described as many times as in its\njudgment may be necessary to effect a sale. In the event that at any\ntime prior to April first, nineteen hundred forty-three no bids are\nreceived on the date named in such advertisement, the commission may,\nwithin sixty days thereafter at a regular or special meeting at which\nnot less than four members are present and acting by the affirmative\nvote of not less than three members, sell such bonds or any part thereof\nat private sale, with or without competition on any bid which it could\nhave legally accepted had it been received on the date named in such\nadvertisement. Such bonds shall be lawful investments for trustees and\nsavings banks of the state, and may be accepted as investments for any\nof the sinking funds or other funds or moneys of the state or of any of\nthe agencies, municipalities or political subdivisions of the state.(b) The amount of any bonds issued hereunder for any purpose, except\nto pay the principal on maturing bonds, shall be included in\nascertaining the power of each of the cities within the district to\ncontract indebtedness; the portion of the total to be included in\ncomputing the debt of each city to be determined in accordance with\ngeneral law.(c) Any provisions of this chapter inconsistent with the provisions of\nthis section ten-A shall not apply to the bonds hereby authorized to be\nissued.§ 10-b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this act or of\nany other general, special or local law, all bonds issued by such\ncommission after this section shall become effective, shall be sold at\npublic sale, except that such commission may sell any of its bonds at\nprivate sale if the state comptroller upon proper application shall give\nhis approval and consent in writing to such private sale and the terms\nthereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, such commission may not\nsell any of its bonds to the state comptroller at private sale or\nexchange any of its bonds for any of its bonds or notes held by the\nstate comptroller.§ 11. No proposition of expenditure of money for the acquisition of\nany real property, or interest therein or the purchase of machinery or\nequipment, or the work of construction of terminals, involving an\nexpenditure of one thousand dollars or upwards, shall be adopted without\nthe consent of three members of such commission. All construction work\nand the purchase of machinery which would involve an expenditure of more\nthan one thousand dollars shall be upon contract, let after\nadvertisement and competitive bidding, and on plans and specifications\non file in the office of the commission.§ 12. No member of such commission shall be pecuniarily interested,\neither directly or indirectly, in the doing or furnishing of any work or\nmaterial for the commission or any municipality, in carrying out such\nplan of port development.§ 13. Any municipality within the district may set aside and devote\nany property owned by such municipality and which is suitable for port\nfacilities, to the uses and control of the port commission, provided,\nthat the legislative body of such municipality shall, by a majority vote\nof all its members and, where there is a board of estimate and\napportionment, by a vote also of a majority of all the members of such\nboard, give consent to such use and control and prescribe the terms and\nconditions upon which the same shall be held.§ 14. The title to any real estate, or interest therein acquired for\nport facilities and to any improvements which may be made thereon,\nsituate in any municipality which has paid for the same, shall remain in\nsuch municipality; but such property shall be maintained and operated\nsubject to the rules and the control of the port commission, and shall\nbe used for port purposes.§ 15. The sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), or so much thereof as\nmay be necessary, is hereby appropriated from any moneys in the state\ntreasury not otherwise appropriated, for paying the expenses in\nconnection with the appointment and functioning of the commission, as\nprovided in this act, until the moneys necessary for meeting the\nexpenses thereafter incurred by such commission, may be assessed, levied\nand collected in the municipalities within the port district as\nhereinbefore provided; and such sum, or so much thereof as may be\nnecessary, shall be paid by the state treasurer on the warrant of the\ncomptroller upon the order of the chairman of the port commission.",

If the\ncommission shall determine as part of such plan that the district shall\nconstruct any port facilities or contribute to the cost of such\nfacilities to be constructed by any municipality, the plan shall contain\nspecifications of all such work, estimates of the cost of each and an\nestimate of the total cost, including the cost of acquiring necessary\nreal property; and the total cost of such work, and amount of such\ncontributions shall be borne by all the municipalities in the district,\nexcept as hereinafter provided. The commission also shall make a\ntentative determination and shall annex to and file with such\nspecifications and estimates a statement showing the proportion of\nbenefit to each municipality in the district from such improvements,\nregard being had to the special benefit to the municipality in which any\ndistrict part of such work is to be done, and from the estimated annual\naverage expenditures of the commission, other than for construction\nwork, for a period of three years. Such proportions shall be expressed\nin decimals. The development of such port shall be deemed and is hereby\ndeclared to be a public, municipal purpose of each city, in the\ndistrict, to the extent of the local benefits accruing and to accrue\ntherefrom. Such decimal, with respect to any municipality, shall\nrepresent the proportion of the total cost to be borne by it, and shall\nbe the proportion of the total amount to be raised annually by tax on\nthe taxable property in the municipality of the portion of such cost to\nbe provided annually, of the annual expenses of the commission other\nthan for construction work and contributions to municipal construction,\nand of any installment of principal and interest of any obligation of\nthe district next to become due. At the end of each three year period,\nnew estimates shall be made of the expenses of the commission, other\nthan for construction work and such contributions, for the ensuing three\nyears, and, if necessary, such apportionment shall be revised. It may\nalso be revised if there be subsequent construction work, not\ncontemplated by the original comprehensive plan, by which the relative\nbenefits of the whole work to the several municipalities are altered.\nNotwithstanding, however, any provisions of this act, the entire cost of\nconstruction of any port facilities within the city of Albany or upon\nland owned by said city, including the cost of acquiring the necessary\nreal property therefor, shall be borne by the city of Albany. Before any\napportionment under this section, or revision thereof, shall be deemed\nfinal, the commission shall cause its determination as to such\napportionment to be published in at least two daily newspapers in the\ndistrict, twice in each week for two weeks, and shall therewith give\nnotice of a public hearing on such apportionment, to be held not less\nthan ten days after the last publication. It shall also give notice to\neach municipality by mailing a notice setting forth the time and place\nof such hearing, which said notice shall be mailed to the mayor, and the\ncorporation counsel of each municipality at least ten days before the\nday of such hearing. It shall give such a hearing and the\nrepresentatives of the governing body of a municipality and any taxpayer\nin the district may be heard for or in opposition to such apportionment.\nAfter such hearing the commission shall file in the office of the clerk\nof each such municipality its final determination, either affirming such\noriginal apportionment or modifying it and affirming it as modified.",
