Except as expressly provided in Section 34-15C-9, nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit any person who is not a registered interior designer from conducting any activity not prohibited by any other state law. Further, registration under this chapter may not be required by this state or by any city, town, county, or other governmental entity or official for the submission, review, approval, or issuance of permits for plans and specifications for or to administer the erection, enlargement, or alteration of any building upon any farm for the use of any farmer, any single family residence of any size, or of any other type building which has a total area of less than 2,500 square feet, provided the building is not a school, church, auditorium, or other building intended for the assembly occupancy of people, nor for any activity other than the submission to building officials of construction documents for commercial interior projects in certain spaces up to 5,000 contiguous square feet, within a building which has a total area of 2,500 square feet or more.\n\n(Act 2010-706, p. 1715, §2(b).)",
