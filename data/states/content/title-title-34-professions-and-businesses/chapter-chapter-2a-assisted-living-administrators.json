On and after September 1, 2003, no assisted living facility in the state may operate unless it is under the supervision of an administrator who holds a currently valid assisted living administrator’s license, or new initial provisional license, issued by the board. No person shall practice or offer to practice assisted living administration in this state or use any title, sign, card, or device to indicate that he or she is an assisted living administrator unless the person shall have been duly licensed as an assisted living administrator or as a provisional assisted living administrator in this state.
