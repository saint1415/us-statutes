In Alabama, when a single business entity provides home medical equipment services from more than one location within the state, each such location shall be licensed. A provider of home medical equipment services that has a principal place of business outside this state shall maintain at least one physical location within this state, each of which shall be licensed.\n\n(b) A license applicant shall submit the application for licensing or renewal to the board on a form promulgated and required by the board.

A license may be renewed within the 60-day period after August 31 upon payment of both the required fee and a late fee as established by rule of the board. Any license that is not renewed before the end of the 60-day grace period shall lapse. A lapsed license may not be renewed unless the holder reapplies and satisfies then current requirements for initial licensure.\n\n(e) License applicants who, upon initial inspection, are found not to comply with applicable licensing standards, shall be notified by the board of the areas of noncompliance and shall be reinspected for compliance upon application and payment of a reasonable reinspection fee established by the board of up to three hundred dollars ($300).\n\n(f) Except as provided in this chapter, the board may inspect all license applicants to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter prior to the issuance of a license.\n\n(g) The board may conduct random inspections upon application for renewal of a license, for cause, and as necessary to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the licensing process.\n\n(h) At any time upon the filing of a substantive, relevant complaint of a consumer of services or other qualified source as identified by the board, the board may inspect the operations of the provider to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(i) The board shall adopt and maintain standards for the individuals charged with conducting the inspections for the purpose of determining compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Board employees or contractors may conduct inspections.\n\n(j) Upon notice of a failure to pass an inspection and obtain a license, a provider shall have 30 days to appeal the inspection results or be subject to penalties pursuant to Section 34-14C-6. Upon appeal, a provider shall have the right to an inspection review or a new inspection in accordance with procedures promulgated by the board.\n\n(Act 2000-739, p. 1619, §4; Act 2004-441, p. 777, §1; Act 2014-74, p. 121, §3; Act 2014-172, p. 489, §1.)",
