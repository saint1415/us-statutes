      "text": "Section 34-21A-1\n\nThe Alabama Onsite Wastewater Board is created to examine, license, and regulate persons engaged in the manufacture, installation, or servicing of onsite sewage systems in Alabama. As more residences are built in rural areas where public sewer hookups and centralized sewage treatment systems are often unavailable, many property owners must rely on onsite sewage systems, such as septic systems, to handle residential waste and sewage. The improper manufacture, installation, service, cleaning, and maintenance of onsite sewage equipment and treatment systems can contaminate and pollute the environment and pose significant harm to public health and the rural environment. This board is created to establish the qualification levels for those engaged in the manufacture, installation, servicing, or cleaning of onsite sewage systems and equipment in Alabama and promote the proper manufacture, installation, and servicing of onsite sewage systems.\n\n(Act 99-571, p. 1265, §1; Act 2010-258, p. 453, §1.)",
