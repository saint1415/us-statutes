      "text": "Section 34-20-4\n\nBoard of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators - Generally.\n\n(a) There is a Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators composed of seven members, six original members as set out in this subsection, and an additional consumer member as set out in subsection (b). The membership of the board shall be inclusive and reflect the racial, gender, geographic, urban/rural, and economic diversity of the state. The six original members shall be composed as follows: Three members shall be nursing home administrators duly licensed and registered under this chapter; one member shall be a physician, licensed under the laws of the State of Alabama, who is actively concerned in a practice with the care of chronically ill and infirm, aged patients; one member shall be a hospital administrator; and one member shall be a registered nurse, licensed in Alabama, who has five years’ experience as a geriatric nurse and who is actively serving as a director of nursing in a geriatric facility.\n\n(b) Within 30 days following April 6, 1993, the Governor shall appoint an additional consumer member of the board for a term that is the same as the term of the member who is a licensed registered nurse. The consumer member shall vote in all matters. No consumer member, or a spouse or immediate family member of a consumer member, shall be a licensee of the board or be employed in the nursing home profession.\n\n(c) All members of the board shall be citizens of the United States and shall be residents of the state. Not more than one board member from any United States Congressional District may be appointed to serve at the same time, unless necessary to ensure diversity on the board or to satisfy other board member qualification requirements of this section.\n\n(d) The three members who are licensed nursing home administrators whose terms expire after April 6, 1993, shall each serve a one-year term of office. Successor members shall serve three-year terms and no board member shall serve, in addition to the one-year term provided in this subsection, more than two consecutive full three-year terms. All members shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed by the Governor.\n\n(e) Appointments to the board for those positions to be held by nursing home administrators shall be made by the Governor from a list of three nominees for each position to be submitted to the Governor by the Alabama Nursing Home Association. The appointment to the board of the member for the position to be held by a physician shall be made by the Governor from a list of three nominees to be submitted by the Medical Association of the State of Alabama. The appointment to the board of the member for the position to be held by a hospital administrator shall be made by the Governor from a list of three nominees to be submitted to him or her by the Alabama Hospital Association. The appointment to the board of the member for the position to be held by a licensed registered nurse shall be made by the Governor from a list of three nominees to be submitted to him or her by the Alabama State Nurses Association. In the event the nominating entities and the Governor are unable to nominate or appoint members to the board so that diversity and other requirements of this section are satisfied, the board may submit a substitute list of three nominees to the Governor for appointment who are selected from the state at-large and otherwise qualify for appointment.\n\n(f) The Governor may remove any board member for misconduct, incapacity, incompetence, or neglect of duty after the board member so charged has been served with a written statement of charges and has been given an opportunity to be heard. Absence from any three consecutive meetings of the board within a calendar year, without cause acceptable to the Governor and the board, shall be deemed cause for removal.\n\n(g) Any vacancy created by the death, resignation, or removal of any board member shall be filled by the Governor for the unexpired term in the same manner as required by this chapter to make appointments.\n\n(h) Each member of the board shall receive a per diem fee of not less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100) to be determined by the board for the time spent in the performance of official duties. Each member shall be reimbursed for all necessary and proper travel and incidental expenses incurred in implementing this chapter as is provided to state employees by the laws of the State of Alabama and regulations of the State Personnel Director. In setting the per diem fee, the board shall give due consideration to funds which are available for that purpose.\n\n(i) The board shall hold four or more meetings a year. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum at any meeting except as provided in Section 34-20-14. A majority vote of the members present shall be sufficient to transact the business of the board except as provided in Section 34-20-14. Meetings may be called by the chair or by a majority of the members of the board. Members shall be given seven days’ written notice of all meetings.\n\n(j) The board shall annually elect from its members a chair and a vice chair, at the first meeting of the board held after October 1 of each year, and each shall serve until the first meeting held after October 1 of the following year. In the event of the death, resignation, or removal of the chair from the board, the vice chair shall succeed as chair for the remainder of the unexpired term. In the event of the death, resignation, removal, or succession to the office of chair of a vice chair, a successor shall be elected by the board to fill the remainder of the unexpired term as vice chair. The chair, or in the absence of the chair, the vice chair, shall preside at all meetings of the board. The chair of the board may appoint a secretary to the board, with the consent of the members of the board, who shall serve at the pleasure of the board. The salary of the secretary shall be fixed by the board. The secretary shall be the executive officer to the board but shall not be a member of the board. The secretary shall have those powers and shall perform those duties as are prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of the board. A clerk and sufficient deputy clerks to adequately assist the board and secretary in the keeping of the records and in the performance of their duties may be appointed by the board subject to the Merit System.\n\n(Acts 1969, No. 986, p. 1734, §4; Acts 1980, No. 80-467, p. 731, §1; Acts 1993, No. 93-152, p. 216, §3; Acts 1997, No. 97-157, p. 208, §3; Act 2001-246, p. 290, §3.)",
