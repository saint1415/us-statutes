However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the compact commission shall be subject to an annual financial review by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the financial review shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the compact commission.\n\n(h) Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification.\n\n(1) The members, officers, executive director, employees, and representatives of the compact commission shall be immune from suit and liability, both personally and in their official capacities, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the individual against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to protect any individual from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct of that individual. The procurement of insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way compromise or limit the immunity granted under this subsection.\n\n(2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the compact commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the compact commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit that individual from retaining his or her own counsel at his or her own expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that individual’s intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct.\n\n(3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the compact commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that individual arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such individual had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct of that individual.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.\n\n(5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state’s state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or rule.\n\n(6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the member states or by the compact commission.\n\n(Act 2024-366, §1.)",

A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under the contract, or based upon another applicable standard of review.\n\n(b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in each member state; provided, however, that where the rules conflict with the laws or rules of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the circumstances under which he or she may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.\n\n(c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.\n\n(d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.\n\n(e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.\n\n(f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.\n\n(g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:\n\n(1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;\n\n(2) To individuals who have requested notice of the compact commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking; and\n\n(3) In such other ways as the compact commission may specify by rule.\n\n(h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n\n(1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;\n\n(2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;\n\n(3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason supporting it;\n\n(4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n\n(5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.\n\n(i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.\n\n(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this section.\n\n(k) The compact commission, by majority vote of all members, shall take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\n(1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.\n\n(2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule, as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.\n\n(3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.\n\n(l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24-hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment; provided, that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n(1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n(2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;\n\n(3) Meet a deadline for the adoption of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or\n\n(4) Protect public health and safety.\n\n(m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission.\n\n(n) No member state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact.\n\n(Act 2024-366, §1.)",

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.

The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n(i) Dispute resolution.\n\n(1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.\n\n(2) The compact commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\n(j) Enforcement.\n\n(1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the compact and its adopted rules.
