A person entitled under this chapter to take and use the title.\n\n(3) SOIL CLASSIFICATION. The soil science evaluation of the nature, physio-chemical properties, formation, taxonomic classification, and general land use suitability on the basis of these parameters within a soil management criteria; it shall specifically include the mapping and identification of surficial and subsurface soil profiles, and the soil management interpretation of these data. Soil classification centers on soils as the biochemically weathered part of the earth’s crust, the collection of natural bodies on the earth’s surface, supporting plants, with a lower limit at the deeper of either the unconsolidated mineral or organic material lying within the zone of rooting of the native perennial plants; or where horizons impervious to roots have developed the upper few feet of the earth’s crust having properties differing from the underlying rock material as a result of interactions between climate, living organisms, parent material, and relief.\n\n(4) PRACTICE OF SOIL CLASSIFICATION. Any professional service which requires the application of soil classification principles and data. Such professional service includes identification and mapping of soils according to the standards of the national cooperative soil survey, consultation, or evaluation.\n\n(5) QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL SOIL CLASSIFIERS. Such persons who, by reason of their knowledge of soil classification acquired by professional education and practical experience, are qualified to engage in the practice of soil classification as defined.\n\n(6) RESPONSIBLE CHARGE OF WORK. The independent control and direction by the use of initiative, skill, and independent judgment of work or the supervision of such work.\n\n(7) SUBORDINATE.
