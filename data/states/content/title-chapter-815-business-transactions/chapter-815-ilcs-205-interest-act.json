It is lawful for any other lender to receive or contract\nto receive and collect interest in an amount not in excess of 1 1/2% per\nmonth of either the average daily unpaid balance of the principal of the\ndebt during the billing cycle, or of the unpaid balance of the debt on\napproximately the same day of the billing cycle. If a lender under a revolving\ncredit arrangement notifies the debtor at least 30 days in advance of any\nlawful increase in the amount or rate of interest to be charged under\nthe revolving credit arrangement, and the debtor, after the effective date\nof such notice, incurs new debt pursuant to the revolving credit\narrangement, the increased interest amount or rate may be applied only to\nany such new debt incurred under the revolving credit arrangement.\nFor purposes of determining the balances to which the increased interest\nrate applies, all payments and other credits may be deemed to be applied\nto the balance existing prior to the change in rate until that balance is\npaid in full. The face amount of the\ndrafts, items, orders for the payment of money, evidences of debt, or\nsimilar written instruments received by the lender in connection with the\nrevolving credit, less the amounts applicable to principal from time to\ntime paid thereon by the debtor, are the unpaid balance of the debt upon\nwhich the interest is computed.

For the\npurposes of the foregoing computation, a \"month\" is deemed to be any time\nof 30 consecutive days.
