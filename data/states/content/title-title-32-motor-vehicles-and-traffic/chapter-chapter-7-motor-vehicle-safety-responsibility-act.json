The director shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and may make rules and regulations necessary for its administration and shall provide for hearings upon the request of persons aggrieved by orders or acts of the director under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(b) Appeal to court.

The court shall determine whether the filing of an appeal shall operate as a stay of any order or decision of the director. The appeal shall be taken by serving written notice of the appeal upon the director, which service shall be made by delivering a copy of such notice to the director and filing the original thereof with the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken and upon giving bond with sureties to be approved by the clerk of the court, payable to the State of Alabama, conditioned to pay all costs created by the appeal. A copy of such notice must also be served upon all other parties in interest, if there be any, by mailing the same to the parties in interest to such addresses of such parties as such parties shall have left with the director. If such parties shall have left no address with the director, then no service on such parties shall be required. The order of filing and service of notice is immaterial. The director shall, within 10 days after receipt of notice, prepare and file with the clerk of the court a true and correct copy of the order or decision appealed from together with a complete transcript of all the proceedings had by him or her with reference to the order, decision, or act appealed from, together with all official forms or documents in the possession of the director pertaining to the order, decision, or act. Immediately upon the return of such matter, the court shall fix a day for the hearing of the appeal and shall cause notice to be served upon the director and upon the appellant and also upon any other parties in interest upon whom service was required under the provisions of this section. The trial upon appeal to the circuit court shall be de novo, and the court shall render judgment confirming, modifying or setting aside the order or decision of the director or, in its discretion, may remand the case to the director for proceedings in conformity with the direction of the court. From the judgment of the circuit court either party may appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama, as in civil cases.\n\n(Acts 1951, No. 704, p. 1224, §2.)",

The policy may not be cancelled or annulled as to that liability by any agreement between the insurance carrier and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage. Any statement made by the insured or on his or her behalf and any violation of the policy shall not defeat or void the policy.\n\n(2) The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for injury or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of injury or damage.\n\n(3) The insurance carrier shall have the right to settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the settlement shall be deductible from the limits of liability specified in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(4) The policy, the written application for the policy, if any, and any rider or endorsement which does not conflict with this chapter shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.\n\n(g) Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy, and the excess or additional coverage shall not be subject to this chapter. With respect to a policy which grants any excess or additional coverage, the term “motor vehicle liability policy” shall apply only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.\n\n(h) Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for this chapter.\n\n(i) Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide for the prorating of the insurance by its terms with other valid and collectible insurance.\n\n(j) The requirements for a motor vehicle liability policy may be fulfilled by the policies of one or more insurance carriers which policies together meet the requirements for a policy.\n\n(k) Any binder issued pending the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy shall be deemed to fulfill the requirements for a policy.\n\n(Acts 1951, No. 704, p. 1224, §21; Acts 1993, 1st Ex.

An affidavit of the applicant as to the nonexistence of such facts, or that he or she has been released from all of his or her liability or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable for such injury or damage shall be sufficient evidence thereof in the absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the director.\n\n(c) Whenever any person whose proof has been cancelled or returned under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section applies for a license or registration within a period of three years from the date proof was originally required, any such application shall be refused unless the applicant shall reestablish such proof for the remainder of such three-year period.\n\n(Acts 1951, No. 704, p. 1224, §29.)",

The policy shall be considered as proof of financial responsibility or insurance pursuant to Chapter 7 and Chapter 7A or any other applicable requirement of state law.\n\n(c) Any applicant for, or any person insured by a policy provided under the Alabama Automobile Insurance Plan, and any insurance company affected by the administration of the plan may appeal to the commissioner from any ruling or decision of the governing committee.

The court shall summarily hear the petition and may enter any appropriate order or judgment.\n\n(d) This section shall not revoke any exception granted to the automobile assigned risk plan under any other provision of this code.\n\n(e) Annually, the governing committee shall file an audited financial report with the commissioner.\n\n(f) The commissioner may establish regulations required to implement the purposes of this section.\n\n(Acts 1951, No. 704, p. 1224, §35, Act 2024-38, §1.)",
