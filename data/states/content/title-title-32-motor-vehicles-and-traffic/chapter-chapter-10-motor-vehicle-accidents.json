Local police departments, and their contracted agents, may retain copies of the written reports.\n\n(b) Accident reports prepared pursuant to this section shall be made available pursuant to Section 32-2-8, to a news-gathering organization solely for the purpose of publishing or broadcasting the news. The news-gathering organization shall not use or distribute the report, or knowingly allow its use or distribution, for a commercial purpose other than the news-gathering organization’s publication or broadcasting of the information in the report. A newspaper, periodical, or radio or television station shall not be held to have used or knowingly allowed the use of the report for a commercial purpose merely because of its publication or broadcast.

The authority of the heir to act on behalf of the decedent shall terminate upon the appointment of a personal representative of the estate of the decedent. The Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency or local law enforcement agency may rely upon the affidavit of the heir stating that he or she meets the requirements of this section and that a personal representative has not been appointed by a probate court with respect to the estate of the decedent. For purposes of this section, heir means a person who is entitled to a distribution from the estate of an intestate decedent or a person who would be entitled to a distribution from the estate of a testate decedent if that decedent had died intestate.\n\nd.
