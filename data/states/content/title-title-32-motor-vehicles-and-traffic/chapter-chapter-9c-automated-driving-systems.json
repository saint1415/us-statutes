Lateral vehicle motion control via steering.\n\nb. Longitudinal vehicle motion control via acceleration and deceleration.\n\nc. Monitoring the driving environment via object and event detection, recognition, classification, and response preparation.\n\nd. Object and event response execution.\n\ne. Maneuver planning.\n\nf. Enhancing conspicuity via lighting, signaling, and gesturing.\n\n(5) FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE.
