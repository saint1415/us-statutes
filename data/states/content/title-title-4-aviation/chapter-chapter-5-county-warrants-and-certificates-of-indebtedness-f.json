All such warrants and certificates shall evidence general obligation indebtedness of the county by which they are issued, and the full faith and credit of the county shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon. The proceeds derived from the sale of any such warrants and certificates shall be used solely for the purpose for which they are authorized to be issued, including the payment of any expense incurred in connection with the issuance thereof.\n\n(Acts 1955, No. 363, p. 881, §2.)",
