A written explanation that any individual who casts a provisional ballot will be able to ascertain under the system described in subsection (g) whether the vote was counted and, if the vote was not counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of an application for an absentee ballot where the voter is not identified as appearing in the precinct for which the voter seeks a ballot, the absentee election manager shall:\n\na.

When verifying a provisional ballot based upon the challenge of an inspector, the board of registrars shall promptly contact the voter by first class mail and provide an explanation of how the provisional voter may respond to the challenge. After determining that the provisional voter has had notice and an opportunity to be heard, the board of registrars shall verify by a certification attached to the challenge statement whether the provisional ballot is due to be counted and, if not, why it should not be counted. The board of registrars shall deliver the provisional voter affirmations and inspector challenge statements, with the certified findings of the board of registrars attached, to the judge of probate, or in municipal elections to the municipal clerk, no later than noon seven days after the election until which time the findings shall remain confidential.

The canvassing board shall certify on a form to be prescribed by the Secretary of State the results of the provisional votes cast and shall post one copy in a public location within the courthouse, or in the city hall in municipal elections, and shall seal one copy with the provisional ballots, provisional voter affirmations, inspector or clerk challenge statements, and certifications of the board of registrars into a sealed container or, in the case of primary elections, containers designated for each political party for such purpose. The containers shall be delivered and remain secured with the other records of the election in accordance with state law.\n\n(g) The board of registrars, after verifying the identity of a provisional voter, shall make available at the request of such voter, the findings of the board of registrars as to whether the individual’s provisional ballot was counted and, if not, the reason why. This may be accomplished by telephone, by letter, or by secured electronic means. The Secretary of State shall provide a secure means for provisional voters to verify by electronic means whether the individual’s vote was counted and, if not, the reason why. There shall be no charge to the provisional voters for obtaining this information.\n\n(h) The Secretary of State, by rule, may address the means of identifying ballots cast by particular provisional voters by the appointing board and the method of providing confidentiality and security to communications with provisional voters seeking information about the status of their ballot. Notice of any proposed rule or amendment to an existing rule relating to provisional balloting shall be sent by certified mail to every judge of probate at least 30 days prior to certification of the proposed rule or amendment under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(Act 2003-313, p. 733, §5; Act 2006-281, p. 496, §1; §17-10A-2; amended and renumbered by Act 2006-570, p. 1331, §50; Act 2019-507, §1.)",
