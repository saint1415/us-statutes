In the event the Commissioner determines that multiple consumers have been injured by a licensee, the Commissioner shall cause a notice to be published for the purpose of identifying all relevant claims.(5) When a surety company receives a claim against the bond of a licensee, it shall immediately notify the Commissioner and shall not pay any claim unless and until it receives notice to do so from the Commissioner.(6) The Commissioner shall have a period of 2 calendar years after the effective date of cancellation or termination of the surety bond by the insurer to submit claims to the insurer.(b)Irrevocable letters of credit. —In lieu of requiring the filing of a surety bond, the Commissioner may, at the Commissioner’s discretion, accept from a licensee an irrevocable letter of credit.(1) Such irrevocable letters of credit shall be provided by an insured depository institution (as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act at 12 U.S.C. § 1813(c)) acceptable to the Commissioner, in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner in the principal sum of $25,000.(2) No irrevocable letter of credit shall be accepted unless the following requirements are satisfied:a.

Compensation under the irrevocable letter of credit shall be for amounts which represent actual losses and shall not be payable for claims made by business creditors, third-party service providers, agents or persons otherwise in the employ of the licensee. The aggregate liability of the insured depository institution issuing the irrevocable letter of credit shall in no event exceed the amount of such irrevocable letter of credit; andb. Draws upon such irrevocable letters of credit shall be available by sight drafts thereunder, in amounts determined by the Commissioner, up to the aggregate amount of the irrevocable letter of credit. Such drafts shall be paid in accordance with § 5-112(1) of Title 6.(3) The Commissioner may require potential claimants to provide such documentation and affirmations as the Commissioner shall determine to be necessary and appropriate. In the event the Commissioner determines that multiple consumers have been injured by a licensee, the Commissioner shall cause a notice to be published for the purpose of identifying all relevant claims.(4) The Commissioner may refuse release of an irrevocable letter of credit, following the surrender of a license, up to 2 years after the effective date of such termination of licensure.68 Del.

The Commissioner shall forthwith serve the written order upon the licensee. Any such order may be reviewed in the manner provided by Chapter 101 of Title 29.68 Del. Laws, c. 326,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del.

Within 10 days after receipt of a statement from the Commissioner, such licensee shall pay or reimburse the fees, costs and expenses of any 3rd parties retained by the Commissioner under this subsection.(c) Any examination under this section may be made by any person or persons designated by the Commissioner, and in such case all the powers vested in the Commissioner by this section shall be possessed by such person or persons so designated.

Mortgage or loan broker disclosures.A licensee may not receive a fee for acting as a mortgage loan broker except pursuant to a written agreement between the mortgage loan broker and the borrower. Such written agreement shall be entered into prior to the time that the mortgage loan broker undertakes to perform mortgage loan brokerage services on behalf of a borrower. A copy of the fully completed written agreement shall be provided to the borrower at the time the borrower signs the agreement.

Laws, c. 326,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2115. Mortgage loan broker fees.A licensee may not accept any fee in connection with a mortgage loan, other than an application fee or any credit report fee, property appraisal fee, title examination fee or other bona fide 3rd-party fee actually and reasonably paid or incurred by the licensee on behalf of the borrower, prior to obtaining a written commitment from a qualified lender (setting forth the terms and conditions upon which the lender is willing to make a mortgage loan to the borrower). The amount of fees that may be collected or received by a mortgage loan broker, whether constituting an application fee, a fee payable to a 3rd party, fee payable at the time of written commitment or upon consummation of a mortgage loan or otherwise, shall be subject to such limitations as may be provided by regulation of the Commissioner. A licensee shall be obligated to refund all fees collected by it from a borrower, other than those fees paid by the licensee to a 3rd party, if a written commitment for a mortgage loan from a qualified mortgage lender is not produced within the time specified by the mortgage loan broker and otherwise at the rate, terms and overall costs agreed upon by the borrower or the mortgage loan does not close; provided however, that a licensee shall not be required to refund fees when the failure to obtain a written commitment for a mortgage loan or the failure of a closing thereunder to occur is due to the substantial fault of the borrower. For purposes of this section, substantial fault of the borrower means that the borrower has:(1) Failed to provide information or documentation required by the lender or mortgage loan broker in a timely manner;(2) Provided information, in the application or subsequently, which upon verification proves to be significantly inaccurate, causing the need for review or further investigation by the lender or mortgage loan broker;(3) Failed to produce, no later than the date specified by the lender, all documentation specified in its mortgage loan commitment or closing instructions as being required for closing; or(4) Failed to be ready, willing or able to close the mortgage loan no later than the date specified by the lender.The Commissioner, by regulation, may provide further definition of the circumstances constituting substantial fault of a borrower, including, without limitation, reasonable time periods for the provision by a borrower of information or documentation or when information will be considered significantly inaccurate.68 Del. Laws, c. 326,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2116.

Laws, c. 247,\n\n§\n\n 7;§\n\n2117.

The Commissioner shall ensure that the system maintains appropriate confidentiality, privacy, data security, and security breach notification policies that are in full compliance with Delaware law.76 Del. Laws, c. 264,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2118. Reverse mortgages.(a) For purposes of this section, unless the context requires otherwise:(1) “Independent housing counselor” means a housing counseling agency approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or any government agency or nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with either the reverse mortgage lender or any other person receiving a fee from the transaction and provides mortgage loan counseling to the public of this State regarding the advisability of entering into a reverse mortgage transaction.(2) “Reverse mortgage loan” means a mortgage loan the proceeds of which are disbursed to the mortgagor in 1 or more lump sums, or in equal or unequal installments, either directly by the lender or the lender’s agent, and which requires no repayment until a future time, upon the earliest occurrence of 1 or more events specified in the reverse mortgage loan contract.(b) A licensee may not accept any fee in connection with a reverse mortgage loan, other than an application fee or a credit report fee, property appraisal fee, title examination fee or other bona fide third-party fee actually and reasonably paid or incurred by the licensee on behalf of the borrower, prior to receiving a written certification from an independent housing counselor attesting that the prospective borrower has received counseling on reverse mortgage loans that includes the information specified in 12 U.S.C. § 1715z-20(f) and such other information as the Commissioner may designate by regulation.76 Del. Laws, c. 335,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n2119.
