Any serial shareholder who is 6 months in arrears in the payment of his or her monthly dues may be required to withdraw any balance due the shareholder from the association. If any serial shareholder, who is delinquent 6 months or more in payment of monthly dues, refuses to accept settlement from the association, or if the association is unable to locate the shareholder, then the association may (1) deposit the amount due the shareholder to his or her credit in an account in any state or national bank as defined in § 101 of this title, or (2) invest in a full paid share account or an installment full paid share account or a similar account of the association in the name of the shareholder.(b) A building and loan association may lend funds of the association either with or without charging the borrower a premium for the privilege of being granted such loan, but an association shall not charge any premium unless the borrower agrees in writing to pay such premium. Any premium charged shall not exceed 3 percent of the original amount of the loan and may be deducted by the association in advance, or paid separately by the borrower at settlement, or if the association consents, may be paid in 3 equal annual installments with the first installment payable at settlement and the other 2 installments on the first and second anniversaries of the date of settlement.A premium paid, pursuant to this section, by a borrower from an association, shall not be deemed usurious, although when it is added to any interests paid upon such loan, it exceeds the legal or the contract rate of interest.32 Del.

Laws, c. 107,\n\n§\n\n 7;39 Del. Laws, c. 19,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\nCode 1935,\n\n§\n\n 2342;45 Del. Laws, c. 165,\n\n§\n\n 1; \n\n5 Del. C. 1953,\n\n§\n\n 1911;56 Del. Laws, c. 328,\n\n§\n\n 5;§\n\n1912.

The building and loan association shall allow the owners of matured stock interest at the rate of not less than 5 percent per annum upon the matured value of the series of stock during the time after the first month that the same remains unpaid.
