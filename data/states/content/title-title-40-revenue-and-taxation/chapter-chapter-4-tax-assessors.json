The commission herein provided for is to be calculated on collections for real property and personal property, except motor vehicles, for the general fund of the state and county.

The commissions for assessment of taxes on motor vehicles for the general fund of the state and county shall be calculated on the same basis and at the same rate as provided for the assessment of taxes on real property and personal property other than motor vehicles for the general fund of the state and county. The amount of the commission on taxes which would be due on property except for the provisions of the presently applicable law exempting homesteads from state taxes shall inure to the benefit of the General Fund of the state only and shall be covered into the State Treasury to the credit of said fund. He shall also be entitled to receive two percent on all collections made by the tax collector of special taxes, whether such special taxes are levied for the state or county, to be paid out of such special taxes. The tax assessor shall receive two percent commission on all special county or district taxes levied for school purposes, but he shall not receive such commissions on such special school taxes unless he has properly apportioned such special taxes.\n\nIn Jefferson County, no fees or commissions shall be allowed for assessing the three-mill county school tax and the three-mill district school tax.\n\nIn all counties having a population of 225,000 or more inhabitants according to the last or any subsequent decennial federal census, the license commissioner, director of revenue, or other official now charged with the duty of assessing motor vehicles for ad valorem taxation shall continue to assess said motor vehicles for state and county ad valorem tax, and all fees, charges, and commissions for assessing state and county ad valorem tax on motor vehicles provided in this section to be paid to the tax assessor shall be paid to said license commissioner, director of revenue, or other official now charged with the assessing of motor vehicles for ad valorem taxes in such counties, and he shall pay said commissions into the county treasury, and all commissions collected by the tax assessor in such counties who is on a salary basis shall be paid into the county treasury, and said commissions so collected and paid into the county treasury shall be the property of the county.\n\n(Acts 1935, No. 194, p. 256; Acts 1939, No. 326, p. 467; Code 1940, T. 51, §30; Acts 1955, No. 563, p. 1224.)",
