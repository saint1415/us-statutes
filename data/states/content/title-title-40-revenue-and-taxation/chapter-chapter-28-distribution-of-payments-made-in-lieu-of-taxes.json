      "text": "Section 40-28-2\n\nDistribution of Tennessee Valley Authority Payments.\n\n(a) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, the State of Alabama will annually transfer to the counties in Alabama served by T.V.A. a portion of the in-lieu-of-taxes payments made by T.V.A. to the State of Alabama. Such transfer of funds shall be according to the following schedule:\n\n(b) The state shall distribute the in-lieu-of-taxes payments each fiscal year to each of the counties served by T.V.A., and the three percent increases after September 30, 2005, generated by the amendments to this section at the 2006 Regular Session of the Legislature shall be allocated by local legislation.\n\n(c)(1) In addition to the distribution provided for in subsection (a) of this section, the state shall distribute each fiscal year five percent of the in-lieu-of-taxes payments to the dry counties and municipalities therein which are not served by T.V.A. Said five percent shall be distributed on the same proportionate basis that each such county received in fiscal year 1978-79 from A.B.C. payments as compared to the total A.B.C. payments received by all dry counties not served by T.V.A. during the same fiscal year. The distribution of such in-lieu-of-taxes payments between each dry non-T.V.A.-served county and the municipalities located therein shall be made pro rata on the basis of A.B.C. payments received by each such jurisdiction in the fiscal year 1979 to the total A.B.C. payments to the county and all municipalities in such county in the fiscal year 1979. Such distribution to the municipalities will be administered by the county governing body.\n\nBeginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, the distribution provided in this subsection to the dry counties and municipalities that are not served by T.V.A. shall be reduced by an amount equal to the funds allocated to those dry counties and municipalities from liquor tax revenues pursuant to Section 40-28-5 until the aggregate annual amount of revenue received by those dry counties and municipalities from the provisions of Section 40-28-5 is equal to the amount of T.V.A. payments distributed to the dry counties and municipalities therein pursuant to this subdivision for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. Until the aggregate annual amount of liquor tax distributions to the dry counties and municipalities not served by T.V.A. provided in Section 40-28-5 is equal to the amount of T.V.A. payments distributed to the dry counties and municipalities therein pursuant to this subdivision for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, the annual amount by which any payments to such counties and municipalities are reduced by liquor tax revenues pursuant to Section 40-28-5 shall be distributed to the counties served by T.V.A. Thereafter, all payments distributed pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed to the counties served by T.V.A. The distribution to the counties served by T.V.A. provided in this subsection is to be allocated in the same manner as the increase generated by the amendment to this section made during the 2006 Regular Session of the Legislature that now appears as subsection (b).\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the distributions to Limestone County, to Madison County, to Marshall County, and to Morgan County provided in this subsection shall be allocated by local law.\n\nThe additional distributions to the above listed counties pursuant to Act 2010-135 shall be held by the respective county separate and apart from other T.V.A. distributions and shall not be expended by the county until the effective date of the local law providing for the allocation of such funds.\n\n(2) Effective for transfers after July 1, 2006, the distribution to the State General Fund shall remain at the level received on July 1, 2006, until the level received attains the amount of seventeen million eight hundred forty thousand two hundred thirty-three dollars ($17,840,233) and thereafter the state shall receive 17 percent of the total amount of the in-lieu-of-taxes payments.\n\n(d) Any T.V.A.-served dry county which is eligible to receive funds under Section 40-28-3 shall receive from that portion of the in-lieu-of-taxes payments not less than that amount which the county received in A.B.C. payments in the fiscal year 1978-79.\n\n(Acts 1978, 2nd Ex. Sess., No. 92, p. 1786, §1; Acts 1979, No. 79-306, p. 458; Acts 1979, No. 79-786, p. 1425, §2; Act 2006-655, p. 1792, §1; Act 2010-135, p. 190, §1.)",

Any county receiving a share of said payments that has within its boundaries a municipality or part thereof that is served in whole or in part by T.V.A. shall share in the county’s payments with said municipality receiving the same amount as the ratio of T.V.A.-served population of the municipality bears to the T.V.A.-served population of the entire county. However, the Legislature may, by general or local laws, prescribe other distribution within such counties to local governments and/or public agencies therein.\n\n(b) The in-lieu-of-taxes payments distributed each year to the served counties shall be as follows:\n\n(1) Eighty percent of the amount of such distribution to the served counties shall be distributed among the counties in the same proportion that the amount of T.V.A. power sales revenue generated in that county less industrial power sales bears to the total amount of T.V.A. power sales revenue generated in all counties less industrial power sales in all served counties.\n\n(2) Ten percent of the amount of such distribution to the served counties shall be distributed among the counties in the same proportion that the book value amount of the T.V.A.‘s property in each county bears to the total book value of all T.V.A.‘s property in all counties served by the T.V.A.\n\n(3) Ten percent of the amount of such percentage of payments shall be distributed among the counties in the same proportion that the T.V.A.‘s industrial power sales in each county bears to the total amount of T.V.A.’s industrial power sales in all served counties of the state.\n\n(Acts 1978, 2nd Ex.
