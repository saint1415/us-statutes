The agreement shall apply only to the specific tax and the tax period for which amnesty is granted.\n\n(c) Amnesty may be granted only for eligible taxes to eligible taxpayers who have not been contacted by the department in the past two years concerning the tax type for which amnesty has been applied and who apply for amnesty during the amnesty period prescribed by this chapter. Amnesty applications must be submitted in an electronic manner as prescribed by the department.\n\n(d) Amnesty applications shall include a written waiver of all rights, restrictions, delays for assessing, collecting, or protesting taxes and interest due as set forth in Chapter 2A and Chapter 2B of this title. The filing of the applications shall make the applicable tax ineligible for refund, credit, or claim against the state and ineligible for redetermination. A taxpayer shall be eligible for a refund or credit if the overpayment arises after the amnesty application is submitted and is attributable to a properly claimed Alabama net operating loss or an adjustment made by the Internal Revenue Service to the taxpayer’s federal income tax, and the taxpayer provides notice of the adjustment to the commissioner within 60 days of receipt of the adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service. A taxpayer who files an application for amnesty retains all administrative and judicial rights of appeal with respect to any additional tax assessed by the department.\n\n(Act 2018-153, §4.)",

The commissioner may impose by rule, after the expiration of the tax amnesty period, a cost of collection penalty not to exceed twenty percent of any additional deficiency assessed for any taxable period for which amnesty was taken. This penalty shall be in addition to all other applicable penalties, fees, or costs. The commissioner may waive any or all of the collection penalty when it is demonstrated that any deficiency of the taxpayer was not due to negligence, intentional disregard of administrative rules, or fraud.
