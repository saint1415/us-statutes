Any person or corporation which shall transfer or deliver or having control thereof shall permit the transfer or delivery of any such property to any person other than a resident legal representative before such tax has been paid shall be liable for the tax and additional penalty of not more than $1,000 in an action brought by the Department of Revenue for the use of the state.\n\n(e) Legal representatives shall be liable for such tax upon and to the extent of all such property which shall come into their hands as such, with interest as hereinafter provided.\n\n(f) Every person having in his possession or control any tangible personal property belonging to the estate of a nonresident and taxable under this chapter shall, unless the property is delivered to a resident legal representative within 30 days after the death of the owner, notify the Department of Revenue and prepare and transmit to the department and the legal representative an itemized schedule of the property. If the tax is not paid or a resident legal representative appointed within nine months after the owner’s death, the Circuit Court of the County of Montgomery shall, upon petition of the Department of Revenue, appoint a resident legal representative, or a special legal representative as the circumstances of the case may require, to whom the property shall be transferred, whose duty it shall be to collect and pay the tax and to account for the balance of the property according to law under order of the court.\n\n(g) All taxes imposed by this chapter in relation to estates of nonresident decedents shall be due and payable at the time of the death of the decedent; and, if not paid within nine months thereafter, unless the time for payment shall be extended, interest shall be charged and collected from the expiration of nine months after the death of the decedent, and said taxes and interest shall be and remain a lien on the property transferred until the same are paid.\n\n(h) Real estate and tangible personal property within the jurisdiction of this state, except as otherwise provided, belonging to nonresidents which shall pass by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift, made in contemplation of death, or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor or donor, shall be subject to the same tax imposed upon transfers hereinbefore described by this chapter. The taxes upon such transfer shall become due and payable at once upon the death of the grantor or donor, and if not paid within nine months from the death of the grantor or donor, unless the time for payment shall be extended, shall be subject to interest as aforesaid after the expiration of said period until paid. Said taxes and interest shall be a charge against the person receiving such property, and the property transferred shall be subject to a lien to secure its payment. All persons or corporations within the jurisdiction of the state in whose possession or control any such property so transferred or to be transferred remains at the time of the death of the grantor or donor shall be subject to all the duties, liabilities, and penalties imposed herein upon persons having the possession or control of the personal estate of such decedent.\n\n(i) A resident legal representative holding personal property of a deceased nonresident subject to said tax shall deduct the tax therefrom or collect it from the legal representative in the state of the decedent’s domicile and shall not deliver such property to him or any other person until he has collected the tax and paid the same to the Department of Revenue. When the transfer of such personal property is subject to a tax under the provisions of this chapter and the legal representative in the state of domicile neglects or refuses to pay the tax upon demand, or if for any reason the tax is not paid within nine months after the decedent’s death, or within the time extended, the resident legal representative may, upon such notice as the Circuit Court of the County of Montgomery may direct, be authorized to sell such property or, if the same can be divided, such portion thereof as may be necessary, and shall deduct the tax from the proceeds of such sale and shall account for the balance, if any, in lieu of the property. When a conveyance made by the nonresident decedent in his lifetime is subject to said tax, the resident legal representative shall collect the taxes due on account of such conveyance and may be authorized to sell any property subject to the lien of such tax, as in other cases.\n\n(j) The Department of Revenue shall determine the amount of all taxes due and payable under the provisions of this chapter in relation to nonresident decedents and shall certify the amount due and payable to the resident legal representative, if any, otherwise, to the person or persons by whom the tax is payable.\n\n(k) The Department of Revenue, whenever it has knowledge or reason to believe that any person, firm, or corporation has in his, its or their possession or control any tangible personal property belonging to the estate of a deceased nonresident upon or in respect to which the tax has not been paid and a schedule of which has not been furnished, as herein provided, or that any such person, firm, or corporation has received a transfer or delivery of such property or made such transfer or delivery, except to a resident legal representative, upon which or in respect to which the tax has not been paid, as herein provided, or that such person, firm, or corporation has knowledge of a transfer or delivery of any such personal property, of such nonresident decedent in his lifetime, by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift, made in contemplation of death, or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor or donor, or has possession or control of property so transferred, may require such person or any member of such firm, or any officer of such corporation to appear at the office of the Department of Revenue at Montgomery, at such time as the Department of Revenue may designate, and then and there to produce for the use of the department all books or papers which may be in the possession or control of such person, firm, or corporation relating to such property or transfer or delivery and to furnish such other information relating to the same as he may be able and the department may require. Whenever the Department of Revenue shall require the attendance of any person, as herein provided, it shall issue a notice stating the time and place when such attendance is required and shall transmit the same by certified or registered mail, or cause a copy of the same to be given in hand, to such person at least 14 days before the date when such person is required to appear. If any person receiving such notice shall neglect or fail to attend or to give attendance so long as may be necessary, for the purpose for which the notice was issued, or refuse to furnish such books or papers or give such information, or if a corporation or firm whose officer or member is thus summoned refuses to permit him to produce such books or papers as are called for and are within the control of the corporation or firm, such person, firm, or corporation shall be liable to a penalty of $25 for each offense, which may be recovered by the Department of Revenue for the use of the state.
