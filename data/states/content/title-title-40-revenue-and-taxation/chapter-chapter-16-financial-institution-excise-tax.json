Any person, firm, corporation, and any legal entity whatsoever doing business in this state as a national banking association, bank, banking association, trust company, industrial or other loan company or building and loan association, and such term shall likewise include any other institution or person employing moneyed capital coming into competition with the business of national banks, and shall apply to such person or institution regardless of what business form and whether or not incorporated, whether of issue or not, and by whatsoever authority existing. The common parent corporation of a controlled group of corporations eligible to elect to file a consolidated excise tax return, in accordance with Section 40-16-3, shall be considered a financial institution if such parent corporation is a registered bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a financial institution, the common parent corporation will be governed by Sections 40-16-1 through 40-16-11 and exempt from all income taxes under Chapter 18 of this title, with the exception that the credit for licenses or taxes as provided by Section 40-16-8 and the rules adopted pursuant thereto by the Department of Revenue will not apply to amounts of excise tax on financial institutions imposed hereby and paid by such parent corporation. Financial institution shall not mean or include individual citizens and fiduciaries acting in a representative capacity for individual citizens, not engaged in a banking, loan, investment, or similar business, but merely making personal investments of personal or fiduciary funds in bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and not made in competition with the business of national banks, nor shall such term apply to insurance companies or insurance associations merely making investments of reserves in bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness and not made in competition with the business of national banks.\n\n(2) INTERNAL REVENUE CODE or U.S.C.

      "text": "Section 40-16-10\n\nComputation of Net Income of Financial Institutions.\n\n(a) In computing the net income of financial institutions subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, there shall be allowed, in addition to the deductions specified therein, a deduction for the sum of the net operating losses which may be carried forward to the taxable year for which the net income of the financial institution is being computed.\n\n(1) The term “net operating loss” for the purposes of this chapter means the amount by which net income of the financial institution, before the deduction allowed by this section, with respect to a taxable year is less than zero. For purposes of this section, the financial institution’s net income shall be determined under this chapter applicable to the year in which the net operating loss arises.\n\n(2) A net operating loss shall be carried forward to the earliest subsequent taxable year in which the financial institution has net income greater than zero, determined without taking into account the deduction allowed by this subsection. The amount of a net operating loss which may be carried to any later taxable year shall be the excess of the net operating loss over the sum of the amounts thereof deductible under this subsection in all the taxable years preceding this taxable year.\n\n(3) If net operating losses arising in more than one taxable year can be carried forward to a taxable year of the financial institution, the net operating loss arising from the earliest of those years shall be deducted first.\n\n(4) The net operating loss allowed by this section shall be limited to sources attributable to Alabama, as determined by applying the allocation and apportionment methodology in the year in which the loss arose pursuant to Section 40-16-4.\n\n(5) A net operating loss may be carried forward and deducted only during the 15 consecutive tax years immediately following the tax year in which it arose.\n\n(b) In the case of a financial institution classified as an acquiring corporation within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 381, or in the case of a financial institution classified as a new loss corporation within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 382, or in the case of the recognized built-in gains of a financial institution classified as a gain corporation within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 384, only the net operating losses as are allowable in accordance with 26 U.S.C. §§ 381, 382, and 384 shall be allowed as a deduction under this section. This subsection shall be applied before the limitations in the preceding subsection are applied.\n\n(c) Net operating losses incurred by members of a qualified corporate group, as defined in Section 40-16-3(c), (including those net operating losses described in subsection (b)) shall be deducted in the following order:\n\n(1) Net operating losses shall be carried forward only on account of the member which incurs the loss (including any prior year net operating losses allocated from the parent under subdivision (2), which subsequently became part of the member’s loss carryforward) and shall be deducted prior to consolidating any resulting taxable income with the other members’ income on the consolidated return under Section 40-16-3(b). Any remaining net operating losses of the member shall be carried forward in accordance with this section.\n\n(2) Any current year net operating losses of the parent of a qualified corporate group, as defined in Section 40-16-3(c), shall be allocated among the other members of the qualified corporate group based on the percentage which the gross assets of each member of the qualified corporate group bears to the total gross assets of all members of the qualified corporate group, excluding the parent of a qualified corporate group, and shall be deducted prior to consolidating any resulting taxable income with the other members’ income on the consolidated return under Section 40-16-3(b). To the extent this loss described in the preceding sentence creates or increases a loss for a member, such loss becomes part of that member’s net operating loss carryforward from the year of such allocation.\n\n(Act 2019-284, §3.)",

      "text": "Section 40-16-11\n\nTransition Rules for Financial Institution Excise Tax Reform Act of 2019.\n\nThis section provides for transition rules for the implementation of the Financial Institution Excise Tax Reform Act of 2019.\n\n(1) Act 2019-284 imposes for the first time a system of prepaid estimated tax payments patterned after the federal system and transitions the Financial Institution Excise Tax from the current post-payment system. To account for this transition, the Department of Revenue shall waive both penalties and interest attributable to underpayments of estimated tax payments occurring within the first two applicable tax years and not attributable to an intentional disregard of the law.\n\n(2) Act 2019-284’s conformity of the depreciation deduction allowed in the calculation of the tax due under this chapter with the corollary deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes, as well as the act’s express rejection of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017’s (i) limitations on the deductibility of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums under 26 U.S.C. § 162(r), (ii) limitations on the deductibility of certain interest under 26 U.S.C. § 163(j), and (iii) inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) under 26 U.S.C. § 951A and deduction of foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI under 26 U.S.C. § 250, are merely a clarification of existing law and shall apply retroactively to all open tax years.\n\n(3) The enactment of Section 40-16-10 extends the carryforward period for net operating losses to a maximum of fifteen tax years, while eliminating the financial institution’s ability to carry back net operating losses to the prior two tax years. The fifteen tax year carryforward period shall only apply to net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2019. The clarification of the ordering rules applicable to net operating losses provided by Section 40-16-10(c) shall apply to all open tax years.\n\n(4) In addition to the deductions from federal taxable income provided by Section 40-16-1.2(b), subject to the limitation provided by Section 40-16-1.2(c), a financial institution may deduct the applicable percentage of dividend income from a Captive REIT if such dividend income would be deductible under 26 U.S.C. § 243 if received from an entity that is not a REIT, as defined in Section 40-18-1(27). For purposes of this subdivision, a “Captive REIT” shall include any REIT, as defined in Section 40-18-1(27), whose shares or certificates of beneficial interest are not regularly traded on an established securities market and are owned or controlled, at any time during the last half of the tax year, by an association taxable as a corporation that is not exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. § 501(a) or a REIT, as defined in Section 40-18-1(27). For purposes of the definition of Captive REIT in this subdivision, own or control means to own or control directly, indirectly, beneficially, or constructively more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of an entity, applying the attribution rules of 26 U.S.C. § 318, as modified by 26 U.S.C. § 856(d)(5), in determining ownership and control. For purposes of this subdivision, the “applicable percentage” shall be: (i) One hundred percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019 and before January 1, 2021; (ii) Eighty percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2022; (iii) Sixty percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2023; (iv) Forty percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and before January 1, 2024; (v) Twenty percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2023 and before January 1, 2025; and (vi) Zero percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.\n\n(5) Act 2019-284’s distribution formula percentages, as stated in § 40-16-6, shall apply to the annual 2019 financial institution excise tax distribution.\n\n(Act 2019-284, §3.)",
