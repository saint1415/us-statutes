      "text": "Section 40-2A-4\n\nTaxpayers’ Bill of Rights.\n\n(a) Rights of the taxpayer.\n\n(1) For purposes of this subsection and subsections (c) and (d), the term “department” shall include the Department of Revenue, a self-administered county or municipality, or a private examining or collecting firm, depending on whether the Department of Revenue, a self-administered county or municipality, or private examining or collecting firm is conducting the examination of the taxpayer.\n\n(2) At or before the commencement of an examination of the books and records of a taxpayer, the department shall provide to the taxpayer the current version of Publication 1A. Publication 1A shall provide, in simple and non-technical terms, a statement of the taxpayer’s rights. Those rights include the right to be represented during an examination, an explanation of their appeal rights, and the right to know the criteria and procedures used to select taxpayers for an examination.\n\n(3) At or before the issuance of a preliminary assessment, the department shall provide to the taxpayer in simple and non-technical terms:\n\na. A written description of the basis for the assessment and any penalty asserted with respect to the assessment.\n\nb. A written description of the method by which the taxpayer may request an administrative review of the preliminary assessment.\n\n(4) At or before the issuance of a final assessment, the department shall inform the taxpayer by a written statement of his or her right to appeal to the Alabama Tax Tribunal or to the circuit court.\n\n(5) Except in cases involving suspected criminal violations of the tax law or other criminal activity, the department shall conduct an examination of a taxpayer during regular business hours after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who refuses a proposed time for an examination on the grounds that the proposed examination would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable alternative times and dates for the examination.\n\n(6) At all stages of an examination or the administrative review of the examination, and in any appeal to the Alabama Tax Tribunal, a taxpayer is entitled to be assisted or represented, at his or her own expense, by an authorized representative. The department shall prescribe a form by which the taxpayer may designate a person to represent him or her in the conduct of any proceedings, including collection proceedings, resulting from actions of the department. In the absence of this form, the department or the Alabama Tax Tribunal may accept such other evidence that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer as it considers appropriate. This subdivision shall not be construed as authorizing the practice of law before the department, Alabama Tax Tribunal, or any court in this state by a person who is not a licensed attorney.\n\n(7) A taxpayer shall be allowed to make an audio recording of any in-person interview with any officer or employee of the department relating to any examination or investigation by the department, provided, however, the taxpayer shall give reasonable advance notice to the department of his or her intent to record and the recording shall be at the taxpayer’s own expense and with the taxpayer’s own equipment. The department shall also be allowed to record any interview if the taxpayer is recording the interview, or if the department gives the taxpayer reasonable advance notice of its intent to record the interview. The department shall provide the taxpayer with a copy of the recording, but only if the taxpayer provides reimbursement for the cost of the transcript and reproduction of the copy. The cost shall be reasonable as prescribed by rules issued by the department.\n\n(8) This section shall not apply to criminal investigations or investigations relating to the integrity of any officer or employee of the department.\n\n(b) Department responsibilities generally.\n\n(1) The commissioner shall appoint one or more taxpayer advocates from among the employees of the department. These officers shall receive and review inquiries or complaints concerning matters that have been pending before the department for an unreasonable length of time, or matters where the taxpayer has been unable to obtain a reasonable response after several attempts to communicate with the department employee assigned to the taxpayer’s case, or his or her immediate superiors. In addition, these officers shall review and have the authority to waive a penalty for reasonable cause as provided in subsection (h) of Section 40-2A-11, shall promptly review inquiries concerning release of property levied upon, the erroneous filing of liens, the failure to release a lien for good cause, or other matters complained of by a taxpayer or other affected party. A taxpayer advocate shall have no authority nor issue any ruling with regard to any taxes collected by or on behalf of a self-administered county or municipality.\n\na. A taxpayer advocate, subject to the approval of the commissioner or the assistant commissioner, shall issue taxpayer assistance orders in the form and manner prescribed herein and by department rules.\n\nb. Notwithstanding any statute of limitation or other provision in this title, a taxpayer assistance order may declare that any tax, including a final assessment, was erroneously assessed or reported and is not a liability due the state, or that a petition for refund was erroneously denied by the department.\n\nc. A taxpayer assistance order shall grant relief as deemed appropriate, including the voiding of any erroneously issued final assessment for a tax which was not a debt due the state, granting of any refund due the taxpayer, or abating an assessment of interest that has accrued because of undue delay by department personnel.\n\nd. At the request of the Alabama Tax Tribunal, a taxpayer advocate shall review a final order issued by the Alabama Tax Tribunal that was not appealed pursuant to Section 40-2B-2, if there is newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to file an application for rehearing pursuant to Section 40-2B-2, and may propose relief as the taxpayer advocate deems appropriate and approved by the commissioner or the assistant commissioner.\n\ne. All taxpayer assistance orders shall be dated and signed by a taxpayer advocate and approved either by the commissioner or the assistant commissioner, and shall state the underlying facts, the reasons for granting relief, and the relief granted. Any taxpayer assistance order, for good cause, may be modified or rescinded in writing by a taxpayer advocate and either the commissioner or the assistant commissioner.\n\nf. A taxpayer advocate shall have full access to department personnel, books, and records subject, however, to the confidentiality restrictions imposed by this chapter.\n\ng. Taxpayer assistance orders shall not be subject to the confidentiality provisions of this title, and shall be maintained by the secretary of the department and shall be open to review upon written request. A taxpayer advocate shall have no authority nor issue any ruling with regard to any taxes collected by or on behalf of a self-administered county or municipality.\n\nh. The commissioner shall make an annual report to the Legislature of all taxpayer assistance orders approved in accordance with this section and Sections 40-2A-2 and 40-2A-3. The report shall contain the total amount of relief granted and the types of taxes for which relief was granted.\n\n(2) The department shall maintain a continuing education program to train employees of the department and to provide them with a current knowledge of state and applicable federal tax laws.\n\n(3) In addition to any other information provided by law, the commissioner shall include in the department’s annual report information about the number or kind of audits or assessments conducted in the year covered by the report.\n\n(4) The department shall not use the amounts of taxes assessed by an employee of the department as:\n\na. The basis of a production quota system for employees; or\n\nb. The basis for evaluating an employee’s performance.\n\n(5) The department shall establish procedures for monitoring the performance of department employees which may include the use of evaluations obtained from taxpayers.\n\n(6) INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.\n\na. The commissioner is authorized to enter into written agreements to allow any taxpayer to pay any tax in installment payments if the commissioner determines that such agreement will facilitate collection of such tax. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such agreements shall be entered into only regarding a tax that has been finally assessed by the department. The commissioner shall only be authorized to enter such an agreement with regard to a tax administered or collected by the department.\n\nb. The commissioner may terminate, alter, or modify any agreement entered into hereunder if:\n\n1. Information provided by the taxpayer to the commissioner prior to the date of such agreement was inaccurate or incomplete;\n\n2. The taxpayer fails to pay any installment at the time such installment payment is due under such agreement;\n\n3. The taxpayer fails to pay any other tax liability due the department at the time such liability is due, unless the taxpayer has appealed such other liability pursuant to the terms of this chapter;\n\n4. The financial condition of the taxpayer has significantly changed;\n\n5. The taxpayer fails to provide a financial condition update as requested by the commissioner; or\n\n6. The commissioner believes that collection of any tax to which an agreement under this subdivision relates is in jeopardy.\n\nc. The commissioner shall have sole authority or discretion to enter into or amend, modify, or terminate any installment payment agreement provided for herein. The commissioner shall adopt rules necessary for the implementation of this subdivision.\n\nd. Any self-administered county or municipality shall have the same authority as provided to the commissioner by this subdivision relating to installment payments with respect to taxes administered or collected by the self-administered county or municipality.\n\n(c) Department failure to comply with this section. The failure of the department to comply with this section shall not prohibit the department from assessing any tax as provided in this chapter, nor excuse the taxpayer from timely complying with any time limitations under this chapter. However, if the department fails to substantially comply with this section, the commissioner, upon application by the taxpayer or other good cause shown, shall abate any penalties otherwise arising from the examination or assessment.\n\n(d) Abatement of penalty. The department shall abate any penalty attributable to erroneous written advice furnished to a taxpayer by an employee of the department. However, this section shall apply only if the department employee provided the written advice in good faith while acting in his or her official capacity, the written advice was reasonably relied on by the taxpayer and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer, and the penalty did not result from the taxpayer’s failure to provide adequate or accurate information.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-186, p. 349, §3; Act 1998-192, p. 310, §9; Act 2000-233, p. 368, §1; Act 2014-146, p. 378, §3; Act 2019-101, §1.)",

Revenue rulings may also govern procedures applicable to the department, and in that event, shall be called “revenue procedures.” Revenue rulings shall be binding on the department and the state, its political subdivisions, and taxing authorities only with respect to the taxpayer making the request and only with respect to the facts contained in the request. The department attorney assigned to review the request for a revenue ruling shall consult with the taxpayer or its authorized representative, if requested by the taxpayer or the authorized representative, prior to issuing the revenue ruling. A revenue ruling shall constitute the department’s interpretation of the law or regulations as applied to the facts contained in the request, but only pertaining to the particular facts described in the request, and only to the taxpayer making the request.\n\n(b) Revenue rulings may be issued only if no taxes have accrued with respect to the transactions, events, or facts contained in the request at the time of the issuance of the ruling.\n\n(c) Revenue rulings may be revoked or modified by the commissioner at any time; but any revocation or modification shall not be effective retroactively unless one of the following has occurred:\n\n(1) The person making the request misstated or omitted facts material to the ruling.\n\n(2) The ruling was issued with respect to a matter involving the computation or payment of a tax that was due and payable at the time the ruling was requested.\n\n(3) The law applied by the commissioner in the revenue ruling is changed in a manner to alter the commissioner’s conclusions in the ruling and the change in the law is made effective as of the date of the ruling.\n\nThe taxpayer may petition for a hearing with the Alabama Tax Tribunal to determine the propriety, under subsections (a), (b), or (c), of any retroactive revocation of a ruling.\n\n(d) All revenue rulings issued by the department shall be published, maintained as a public record, and made available by the department for public inspection and copying, within a reasonable time following their issuance, at a reasonable cost to be determined by the department. Prior to publication, the department shall delete from the text of the ruling all names, addresses, titles, figures, dates, and other information which may identify the particular taxpayer who requested the ruling. If a revenue ruling contains trade secrets or other confidential information, the department shall, upon written request of the taxpayer, delete that information prior to publication.\n\n(e) Requests for revenue rulings shall be submitted in writing to the secretary in the form and manner as prescribed by department regulations, accompanied by a fee of two hundred dollars ($200). The commissioner shall either issue or refuse to issue a ruling within 120 days after receipt of the request unless the taxpayer consents to an extension of time. If the commissioner refuses to issue a ruling within the time prescribed, the two hundred dollar ($200) fee shall be refunded to the taxpayer. A request may be withdrawn at any time prior to the issuance of the requested ruling, in which case there shall be no refund of the two hundred dollar ($200) fee.\n\n(f) Revenue rulings shall be issued in the name of the commissioner.\n\n(g) Subject to the provisions of this section, the commissioner may also issue a revenue ruling in response to a written request by a governing body of a self-administered county or municipality, or by a taxpayer, regarding the substantive application of a sales, use, rental, or lodgings tax levied by or on behalf of the self-administered municipality or county; provided, however, that the commissioner may not (i) issue a revenue ruling interpreting any tax levied by or on behalf of a self-administered municipality or county which levies a gross receipts tax in the nature of a sales tax, as defined in Section 40-2A-3(8), or (ii) issue a revenue ruling that would establish a rule of nexus determining the locality to which sales and use taxes, or gross receipts taxes in the nature of a sales tax as defined by Section 40-2A-3(8), are due if the locality is a self-administered county or municipality, as defined by Section 40-2A-3(20). Revenue rulings shall be binding on a self-administered county or municipality only with respect to the specific taxpayer making the request and only with respect to the specific facts contained in the request. Any ruling shall, if the other requirements of this section are met, be issued within 45 days of receipt of the request, and if the requesting party is a self-administered municipal or county governing body, the fee for issuance of the ruling shall be waived. If the requesting party is a taxpayer, the department shall, promptly upon receipt, forward a copy of the ruling request to the appropriate municipal or county governing body and shall consult with and accept written comments from representatives of the municipality or county prior to issuance of the ruling.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-186, p. 349, §5; Acts 1995, No. 95-607, p. 1279, §2; Act 98-191, p. 297, §2; Act 2014-146, p. 378, §3.)",

      "text": "Section 40-2A-6\n\nGovernment Contract for Examination of Taxpayer’s Records Where Compensation, Etc., Contingent Upon Tax, Interest, Etc., Assessed or Collected; Violation; Costs of Examination.\n\n(a) The state or any county or municipal governing authority may not enter into any contract or arrangement for the examination of a taxpayer’s books and records, written or otherwise, with a private auditing or collecting firm, if any part of the compensation or other benefits paid or payable to the private auditing or collecting firm is contingent upon or in any manner related to the amount of tax, license fee, interest, court cost, penalty, or any other item assessed against or collected from the taxpayer. Any such contract or arrangement, if made or entered into, is void and unenforceable. Any assessment or preliminary assessment of taxes, license fees, penalties, court costs, interest, or other items proposed or asserted by, or based upon the recommendation of, a private auditing or collecting firm compensated under any such contract or arrangement shall be void and unenforceable. This provision does not prohibit or restrict the state or any county or municipal governing authority from entering into contracts or arrangements for the collection of any tax, interest, court cost, or penalty when the private auditing or collecting firm has no authority to determine the amount of tax, interest, court cost, or penalty owed the state, county, or municipal governing authority.\n\n(b) The compensation or other benefits paid or payable to any employee or other agent of a private auditing or collecting firm or to any employee or other agent of the state or county or municipal governing authority serving in the capacity of a hearings or appeals officer, including an attorney serving in that capacity, may not be contingent upon, in whole or in part, or otherwise related to in any manner, the amount of tax, license fee, interest, court cost, penalty, or other item assessed against or collected from the taxpayer. Any contract or arrangement based, in whole or in part, on any such contingency is void and unenforceable. Any assessment or preliminary assessment of taxes, license fees, penalties, court cost, interest, or other items proposed or asserted by or upon the recommendation of a private auditing or collecting firm, compensated under any such contract or arrangement, is void and unenforceable.\n\n(c) Any person violating this section, for each violation, shall have committed a Class A misdemeanor. Violators shall also forfeit any certification granted under Section 40-2A-14. Any private auditing or collecting firm that violates subsections (a) or (b) shall forfeit its license issued under Section 40-12-43.1 until such time as it and each of its examiners or other employees or agents involved in the violation meet any remedial requirements prescribed by the board created under Section 40-2A-15. This provision may not, however, preclude employees of a private auditing or collecting firm from participating in a profit-sharing arrangement generally made available to other employees of the firm who are not engaged in examining taxpayers’ books and records, provided that the formula utilized in calculating the profit-sharing allocations is based primarily on the overall profitability of the firm and secondarily on non-monetary criteria such as age or years of service.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the state or any county or municipal governing authority may not assess or attempt to assess a taxpayer for any costs incurred by, or charged to, the state, county, or municipality in connection with performing an examination of the taxpayer’s books and records, including lodging, meals, or mileage charges, and any assessment or proposed assessment of such costs is void and unenforceable. A self-administered county or municipality may, however, assess and collect from the taxpayer the reasonable costs, based on the then current state government employee per diem rates incurred by, or charged to, the county or municipality in connection with performing an examination of the taxpayer’s books and records, if the taxpayer received notice by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, at least 30 days prior to the date on which the examination was to commence and the taxpayer either failed or refused to respond or did not propose a reasonable alternative date on which the examination was to commence within 15 days of receipt of notice of the pending examination, or the taxpayer and the self-administered county or municipality agreed in writing as to an alternative date on which the examination was to commence but the taxpayer then failed or refused to permit reasonable access to its books and records on the alternative date. This subsection does not apply to examinations of the books and records of a taxpayer with respect to the insurance premium license tax levied by Chapter 4A, Title 27, or examinations for gasoline or motor fuel taxes if authorized by local law in effect on July 1, 1998.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-186, p. 349, §5A; Act 98-191, p. 297, §3; Act 2016-406, §1.)",

The books, records, and other information shall be open and available for inspection by the department upon request at a reasonable time and location.\n\n(2) The department may examine and audit the records, books, or other relevant information maintained by any taxpayer or other person for the purpose of computing and determining the correct amount of value or correct amount of any tax, license, or fee administered by the department, or for any other purpose necessary for the proper administration of any matter under the jurisdiction of the department.\n\n(3) A taxpayer, or any officer of a corporation or association, or partner of a partnership, or fiduciary of a trust, or responsible individual of any entity under a duty to maintain books and records pursuant to this subsection who fails or refuses to maintain such records and books, or permit inspection, shall be subject to contempt proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the person resides or has a principal place of business, and upon proof of the fact to the court, may be punished for contempt as provided in cases of contempt in circuit court.\n\n(4) The department may summon any witness to appear and give testimony, and summon by subpoena duces tecum any records, books, or other information of any kind relating to any matter which the department has authority to administer. The witness may be summoned by subpoena issued by the secretary of the department, any circuit judge, any magistrate, or any district judge, in the name of the department, directed to any sheriff of Alabama and returnable to the department. The subpoena may be served in like manner as subpoenas issued out of any circuit court, or the subpoena may be served by an authorized employee of the department or by either U.S. mail with delivery confirmation or certified mail, return receipt requested. A fee shall be paid to banking institutions, other similar entities, or any other person except the taxpayer, for copying, searching for, reproducing, and transporting any records, books, papers, or other documents requested or subpoenaed by the department and to persons who are required to appear as a witness equal to the fee authorized to be paid by the Internal Revenue Service for similar services or appearances pursuant to Section 7610 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If any witness has been subpoenaed to appear and testify or appear and produce records, books, or other information, and fails or refuses to appear or testify or to produce the books, records, or other information, that witness shall be subject to contempt proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the witness resides, and upon proof of the fact to a circuit court may be punished for contempt as is provided in cases of contempt in circuit court.\n\n(5) The department may issue forms and make reasonable regulations concerning any matter administered by the department. Regulations promulgated by the department shall be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 22 of Title 41.\n\n(b) Procedures governing entry of preliminary and final assessments; appeals therefrom.\n\n(1) ENTRY OF PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT; FINAL ASSESSMENT OF UNCONTESTED TAX; EXECUTION OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL ASSESSMENTS.\n\na. If the department determines that the amount of any tax as reported on a return is incorrect, or if no return is filed, or if the department is required to determine value, the department may calculate the correct tax or value based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable by the department. The department may thereafter enter a preliminary assessment for the correct tax or value, including any applicable penalty and interest.\n\nb. Where the amount of tax or value reported on a return is undisputed by the department, or the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency, determination of value, or preliminary assessment in writing as provided by regulation, the department may immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of the tax or value, plus applicable penalty and interest; provided, the department may at any time enter a final jeopardy assessment pursuant to Sections 40-17A-12, 40-29-90, and 40-29-91.\n\nc. All preliminary and final assessments issued by the department shall be executed as provided by regulations promulgated by the department.\n\n(2) TIME LIMITATION FOR ENTERING PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT. Any preliminary assessment shall be entered within three years from the due date of the return, or three years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later, or if no return is required to be filed, within three years of the due date of the tax, except as follows:\n\na. A preliminary assessment may be entered at any time if no return is filed as required, or if a false or fraudulent return is filed with the intent to evade tax.\n\nb. A preliminary assessment may be entered within six years from the due date of the return or six years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later, if the taxpayer omits from the taxable base an amount properly includable therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of the taxable base stated in the return.\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph:\n\n1. The term taxable base means the gross income, gross proceeds from sales, gross receipts, net worth, or other amounts on which the tax paid with the return is computed; and\n\n2. In determining the amount omitted from the taxable base, there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted from the taxable base stated in the return if the amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the department of the nature and amount of the item.\n\nc. A preliminary assessment entered pursuant to Sections 40-29-72 and 40-29-73, may be entered within five years from the due date of the return on which the underlying tax is required to be reported or within five years of the date the return is filed, whichever is later.\n\nd.1. In the case of income received during the lifetime of a decedent, or by his or her estate during the period of administration, the preliminary assessment of any income tax shall be entered within 18 months after written request therefor, filed after the return is made, by the executor, administrator, or other fiduciary representing the estate of the decedent, but not after the expiration of three years from the due date of the return or three years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later.\n\n2. In the case of income received by a corporation contemplating dissolution, a preliminary assessment of any income tax shall be entered within 18 months after written request, by the corporation, filed after the return is made, but not after the expiration of three years from the due date of the return or three years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later. This subparagraph shall not apply to any corporation unless dissolution is completed within 18 months of the date of the written notice.\n\ne. If a taxpayer has made the election provided in subsection (d) or (e) of Section 40-18-8, a preliminary assessment based on the gain realized as a result of the involuntary conversion [in the case of subsection (d) of Section 40-18-8] or a rollover of gain on the sale of a personal residence [as provided in subsection (e) of Section 40-18-8] may be entered within three years from the date the taxpayer notified the department of the replacement of the property in accordance with subsection (d) or (e) of Section 40-18-8, as the case may be, or of his or her intention not to replace the property.\n\nf. If a taxpayer has validly elected to have the provisions of subdivision (a)(7) of Section 40-18-6 and subsection (l) of Section 40-18-8 apply to an acquisition of stock before January 1, 1985, any liability of the taxpayer under this title, solely from amendment of its returns to be consistent with that election may be assessed at any time within five years from the date on which the taxpayer filed the amended returns with the department.\n\ng.1. When the Internal Revenue Service changes the amount of federal income tax or federal estate tax in any manner and the change results in an increase in additional income tax or estate tax owed under this title, the department may, at any time within one year after the department is notified or otherwise learns that the change has become final, enter a preliminary assessment for additional tax due. The department shall be allowed to assess the tax within the time period otherwise allowed by this section. Any tax assessed within the additional one year period allowed shall be limited to those items changed on the federal income tax return or federal estate tax return that affect the income tax liability or the estate tax liability imposed by this title.\n\n2. When a federal income tax return or federal estate tax return is changed in any manner after it has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, other than by an amended return, and the change results in an overpayment of taxes imposed by this title, a petition for refund of the overpayment may be filed within the later of one year after the federal changes become final, or within the time allowed for the filing of a petition for refund as provided in this chapter. The refund shall be limited to those items changed on the federal income tax return or federal estate tax return that affect the income tax liability or estate tax liability imposed by this title.\n\n3. For purposes of this subdivision, the date that a federal change becomes final is the date on which the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service formally agree to the changes, or the date of any administrative or judicial order, judgment, or decree from which no further appeal was or may be taken.\n\nh. The running of the period of limitations provided herein for entering a preliminary assessment shall be suspended for the period that:\n\n1. The taxpayer or the assets of the taxpayer are involved in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code, Bankruptcy, and for a period of six months thereafter; or\n\n2. The assets of the taxpayer are in the control or custody of a court in any proceeding, and for a period of six months thereafter.\n\ni. The department and the taxpayer may, prior to the expiration of the period for entering a preliminary assessment or the filing of a petition for refund, agree in writing to extend the time provided for entering the assessment or filing the petition in this chapter. The tax may be assessed, or the petition for refund may be filed, at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.\n\nj. Additional tax may be assessed by the department within any applicable period allowed above, even though a preliminary or final assessment has been previously entered by the department against the same taxpayer for the same or a portion of the same tax period. No taxpayer, however, shall be subject to unnecessary examination or investigation, and only one inspection of a taxpayer’s books and records relating to each type of tax administered by the department shall be made for each taxable year, unless the taxpayer requests otherwise or unless the commissioner after investigation, notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations consistent with those followed by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to second inspection of a taxpayer’s books and records.\n\nk. The three-year statute of limitations provided by this subdivision for entering a preliminary assessment shall be extended as provided in the following sentence, for the benefit of a self-administered county or municipality, in cases where: 1. the department has audited a taxpayer and has entered a final assessment against the taxpayer for additional sales, use, rental, or lodgings tax; 2. the taxpayer owes the same type of tax to the self-administered county or municipality for the same tax period or periods; and 3. the taxpayer or its authorized representative has not contacted the county or municipality or its private auditing firm, pursuant to its voluntary disclosure program, prior to the date of entry of the final assessment. In such cases, the statute of limitations shall not expire until the earlier of six months from the date of entry of the final assessment or 60 days following the date of mailing or transmittal by electronic mail by the department to the self-administered county or municipality or its private auditing firm of a copy of the notice of final assessment and any attachments thereto. Any tax assessed by the self-administered county or municipality within the additional time period allowed by this subdivision shall be limited to those items changed or adjustments included in the final assessment entered by the department. The Alabama Tax Tribunal, during the months of January and July of each year, shall publish a list of pending appeals and the tax or taxes at issue.\n\n(3) SERVICE OF PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT UPON TAXPAYER. The preliminary assessment entered by the department, or a copy thereof, shall be promptly mailed by the department to the taxpayer’s last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified mail with return receipt requested, but at the option of the department, the preliminary assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal service.\n\n(4) PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF DISPUTED PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS; ENTRY AND NOTICE OF FINAL ASSESSMENT.\n\na. If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the department, the taxpayer may file a written petition for review with the department within 30 days from the date of mailing or personal service, whichever occurs earlier, of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. If a petition for review is timely filed, or if the department otherwise deems it necessary, the department shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer and the department to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors, and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to their respective positions.\n\nb. If a written petition for review:\n\n1. Is not timely filed, or\n\n2. Is properly filed, and upon further review the department determines the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the department may make the assessment final in the amount of tax due as computed by the department, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment.\n\nc. If a preliminary assessment is not withdrawn or made final by the department within five years from the date of entry, the taxpayer may appeal the preliminary assessment to the Alabama Tax Tribunal or to the appropriate circuit court as provided by subsection (b)(5) for an appeal of a final assessment.\n\nd. The final assessment entered by the department, or a copy thereof, shall be mailed by the department to the taxpayer’s last known address by either (i) first class U.S. mail or certified mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of tax of five hundred dollars ($500) or less or (ii) certified mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of tax of more than five hundred dollars ($500). In either case and at the option of the department, the final assessment, or a copy thereof, may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal service.\n\n(5) PROCEDURE FOR APPEAL FROM FINAL ASSESSMENT.\n\na. A taxpayer may appeal to the Alabama Tax Tribunal from any final assessment entered by the department by filing a notice of appeal with the Alabama Tax Tribunal within 30 days from the date of mailing or personal service, whichever occurred earlier, of the final assessment, and the appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as provided in Chapter 2B for appeals to the Alabama Tax Tribunal.\n\nb.1. In lieu of the appeal under paragraph a., at the option of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may appeal from any final assessment to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, or to the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has a principal place of business in Alabama, as appropriate, by filing notice of appeal within 30 days from the date of mailing or personal service, whichever occurs earlier, of the final assessment with both the secretary of the department and the clerk of the circuit court in which the appeal is filed.\n\n2. If the appeal is to the circuit court, the taxpayer, also within the 30-day period allowed for appeal, shall do one of the following:\n\n(i) Pay the tax, interest, and any penalty shown on the final assessment.\n\n(ii) File a supersedeas bond with the court for 125 percent of the amount of the tax, interest, and any penalty shown on the final assessment. The supersedeas bond shall be executed by a surety company licensed and authorized to do business in Alabama and shall be conditioned to pay the amount of tax, interest, and any penalties shown on the final assessment, plus applicable interest and any court costs relating to the appeal, payable to the department, or the self-administered county or municipality, if applicable.\n\n(iii) File an irrevocable letter of credit with the circuit court in an amount equal to 125 percent of the amount of the tax, interest, and any penalty shown on the final assessment. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued by a financial institution designated as a qualified public depository by the Board of Directors of the Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement (SAFE) Program pursuant to Chapter 14A, Title 41. The department or the self-administered county or municipality, if applicable, shall be named the beneficiary of the irrevocable letter of credit. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be conditioned to pay the assessment plus applicable interest and any court costs relating to the appeal. The taxpayer may not issue an irrevocable letter of credit as to a final assessment entered against the same taxpayer.\n\n(iv) File a pledge or collateral assignment of securities with the circuit court that constitute eligible collateral under Chapter 14A, Title 41, in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount of the tax, interest, and penalty shown on the final assessment. The pledge or collateral assignment shall be in favor of the department or the self-administered county or municipality, if applicable, and conditioned to pay the assessment plus applicable interest and any court costs relating to the appeal.\n\n(v) Show to the satisfaction of the clerk of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken that the taxpayer has a net worth, on the basis of fair market value, of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or less, including his or her homestead.\n\n3. A taxpayer may appeal a final assessment to either the Alabama Tax Tribunal or to circuit court as provided herein, even though the taxpayer has paid the tax in issue prior to taking the appeal.\n\nc.1. The filing of the notice of appeal with the Alabama Tax Tribunal or, in the case of appeals to the circuit court, the filing of the notice of appeal with both the secretary of the department and the clerk of the circuit court in which the appeal is filed and also the payment of the assessment in full and applicable interest or the filing of a supersedeas bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a pledge or collateral assignment of securities as provided herein, are jurisdictional. Except as set forth in subparagraph 2., if such prerequisites are not satisfied within the time provided for appeal, the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., should the circuit court determine that the taxpayer has not satisfied the requirements of subparagraph b.2., the circuit court shall order that the taxpayer satisfy such requirements. The taxpayer may satisfy such requirements at any time within 30 days after service of the court order. No order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction shall be entered within 30 days after service of the court order, and no order of dismissal shall thereafter be entered if such requirement is satisfied within such 30-day period.\n\n3. On appeal to the circuit court or to the Alabama Tax Tribunal, the final assessment shall be prima facie correct, and the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to prove the assessment is incorrect.\n\nd.1. The Alabama Tax Tribunal, circuit court, or the appellate court on appeal may increase or decrease the assessment to reflect the correct amount due.\n\n2. If a final assessment is reduced on appeal, any overpayment of tax paid by the taxpayer shall immediately be refunded to the taxpayer by the state, county, municipality, or other entity to which the overpayment was distributed.\n\n3. No court shall have the power to enjoin the collection of any taxes due on an assessment so appealed or to suspend the payment thereof.\n\n(c) Procedure governing petitions for refund; appeals therefrom.\n\n(1) PETITION FOR REFUND ALLOWED, GENERALLY. Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the department for any overpayment of tax or other amount erroneously paid to the department or concerning any refund which the department is required to administer. If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the department, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment plus applicable interest has been paid in full prior to or with the filing of the petition for refund. The department may also issue automatic refunds pursuant to Section 40-29-71. In the case of a petition for refund of public utilities taxes pursuant to Chapter 21, sales or use taxes pursuant to Chapter 23, and any transient occupancy tax pursuant to Chapter 26, a petition may be filed by the consumer/purchaser who paid the tax directly to the taxpayer that collected the tax, or by the taxpayer if the taxpayer remitted in excess of the tax due, however never collected the tax from the consumer/purchaser, or by the taxpayer if the consumer/purchaser paid the tax directly to the taxpayer, provided that a refund shall not be paid to the taxpayer until after the tax has been credited or repaid to the consumer/purchaser by the taxpayer. The department may adopt rules and establish procedures regarding petitions for refund, including establishing procedures for claiming such refunds on an annual basis when the amount of a refund is less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and offsetting any state use tax liability against any refund otherwise due prior to paying a refund.\n\n(2) TIME LIMITATION FOR FILING PETITION FOR REFUND; AUTOMATIC REFUND.\n\na. Generally. A petition for refund shall be filed with the department or an automatic refund issued pursuant to Section 40-29-71, or a credit allowed, within (i) three years from the date that the return was filed, or (ii) two years from the date of payment of the tax, whichever is later, or, if no return was timely filed, two years from the date of payment of the tax. For purposes of this paragraph, taxes paid through withholding or by estimated payment shall be deemed paid on the original due date of the return.\n\nb. Net Operating Loss Carryback. In lieu of the periods provided in paragraph a., in the case of a net operating loss carryback, the period for filing a petition for refund, the department making an automatic refund or allowing a credit shall be the period prescribed in 26 U.S.C. Section 6511(d)(2) for the claiming of a credit or refund.\n\n(3) DEPARTMENT REQUIRED TO GRANT OR DENY REFUNDS; TIME LIMITATIONS. The department shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the department. The taxpayer shall be notified of the department’s decision concerning the petition for refund by first class mail, or by either United States mail with delivery confirmation or by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer’s last known address. If the department fails to grant a refund within the time provided herein, the petition for refund shall be deemed to be denied.\n\n(4) PROCEDURES IF REFUNDS GRANTED; CREDIT OF REFUND; PAYMENT OF OTHER TAXES; PAYMENT OF INTEREST. If a petition is granted, or the department, the Alabama Tax Tribunal, or a court otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the state, county, municipality, or other entity to which the overpayment was distributed. If the department determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus accrued interest may first be credited by the department against any outstanding final tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the department, and the balance of any overpayment shall, subject to the setoff provisions of Article 3 of Chapter 18, be refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the department, the department shall provide a written detailed statement to the taxpayer showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and the amount refunded.\n\n(5) PROCEDURES IF REFUND DENIED; APPEAL.\n\na. A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the Alabama Tax Tribunal within two years from the date the petition is denied, and the appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as hereinafter provided for appeals to the Alabama Tax Tribunal.\n\nb. In lieu of appealing to the Alabama Tax Tribunal, the taxpayer may appeal from the denial of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the Circuit Court in Montgomery County, Alabama, or the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has a principal place of business in Alabama, as appropriate, by filing the notice of appeal within two years from the date the petition is denied. The circuit court shall hear the appeal according to its own rules and procedures and shall determine the correct amount of refund due, if any.\n\nc. If an appeal is not filed with the Alabama Tax Tribunal or the circuit court within two years of the date the petition is denied, then the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n(d) The Department of Revenue shall revise existing regulations or administrative guidance, or issue new regulations or administrative guidance, as appropriate, in conformance with this section.\n\n(e) This section shall apply to all appeals filed after June 15, 2007. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, in any appeal to a circuit court which is pending on June 15, 2007, and in which a supersedeas bond was filed pursuant to, and in compliance with, the requirements of this section, for double the amount of the tax, interest, and any penalty shown on the final assessment, or for double the amount of the final order of the administrative law judge, such bond may be reduced to 125 percent of such amount shown on the final assessment or in the final order of the administrative law judge.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-186, p. 349, §6; Acts 1995, No. 95-607, p. 1279, §2; Act 2007-504, p. 1086, §§1-3; Act 2014-146, p. 378, §3; Act 2018-180, §1.)",

      "text": "Section 40-2A-8\n\nProcedures Governing Denial or Revocation of Licenses, Permits, and Certificates of Title; Procedures for Contesting Any Other Act or Failure to Act; Appeals.\n\n(a) The department shall notify a taxpayer in writing of any act or proposed act or refusal to act concerning the denial or revocation of a license, permit, or certificate of title concerning which the taxpayer has any interest. The notice must be mailed by either first-class U.S. mail, U.S. mail with delivery confirmation, or certified U.S. mail to the taxpayer’s last known address. Any taxpayer aggrieved by any act or proposed act or refusal to act concerning the denial or revocation of a license, permit, or certificate of title by the department shall be entitled to file a notice of appeal from such act or proposed act or refusal to act with the Alabama Tax Tribunal. Such notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date notice of such act or refusal to act is mailed to the taxpayer, and such appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as herein provided for appeals to the Alabama Tax Tribunal.\n\n(b) A taxpayer may elect, but is not required, to file a notice of appeal with the Alabama Tax Tribunal regarding a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the department affecting the taxpayer’s net operating loss deductions or carryovers for purposes of the taxes imposed by Chapters 16 and 18 of this title. Such notice of appeal shall be filed within the time period prescribed in subsection (a), and the Alabama Tax Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of the taxpayer’s net operating loss deductions or carryovers for the tax periods in question.\n\n(c) The department may proceed with the intended action if no appeal is filed by the taxpayer with the Alabama Tax Tribunal within the time allowed under subsection (a). If a designated agent has failed to provide the department with a bond and any qualifying license as provided in Section 32-8-34, the revocation of designated agent status by the department shall be effective immediately upon electronic notice through the system the designated agent uses to process applications for certificates of title or receipt of written notice of revocation, whether by U.S. mail or hand delivery. Otherwise, the revocation of a designated agent status shall be effective after the time for appeal under this section has expired. If a new or used motor vehicle dealer, motor vehicle wholesaler, motor vehicle reconditioner, or motor vehicle rebuilder licensee has failed to provide the department with or maintain the required bond or insurance, the revocation of the regulatory license shall be effective immediately upon electronic notice through the system the licensee uses to apply for or renew the regulatory license or upon written notice or revocation, whether by U.S. mail or hand delivery. Otherwise, the revocation of the regulatory license shall be effective after the time for appeal under this section has expired. The revocation of any motor vehicle certificate of title or license by the department shall not be final until either the titled owner and lien holder, if any, consent to the revocation or the time for filing an appeal to the Alabama Tax Tribunal has expired. The department may obtain an injunction in the appropriate circuit court at any time enjoining a licensee or designated agent from continuing to operate under a disputed license or designated agent authority, if the continued operation may cause substantial loss of revenue, would cause substantial harm to the state or public, or for such other good reason as determined by the circuit court. The department may suspend the designated agent’s access to process new applications for certificate of title until such time as any outstanding title applications not properly filed by the designated agent are properly filed with the department.\n\n(d) This section shall not apply to the procedures governing assessments and refunds which are otherwise provided for by this chapter, or to intradepartmental personnel actions or any matter which is the subject of any action then pending in state or federal court, or to the collection of any liability due the department.\n\n(e) A taxpayer may appeal any matter governed by this section in accordance with Section 40-2B-2(m) only after exhausting his or her appeal rights provided under this section. Any appeal must be from a final or appealable order issued by the Alabama Tax Tribunal.\n\n(Acts 1992, No. 92-186, p. 349, §7; Act 2014-146, p. 378, §3.)",

Except in the case of an individual income tax return filed with no tax due at the time of filing, if a taxpayer fails to file any return required to be filed with the department on or before the date prescribed therefor, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing, there shall be assessed as a penalty the greater of 10 percent of any additional tax required to be paid with the return or fifty dollars ($50).\n\n(b) Failure to timely pay tax.\n\n(1) If a taxpayer fails to pay to the department the amount of tax shown as due on a return required to be filed on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax, determined with regard to any extension of time for payment, there shall be added as a penalty one percent of the amount of the tax due if the failure to pay is for not more than one month, with an additional one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which failure to pay continues, not exceeding 25 percent in the aggregate. In lieu of the penalty provided in the immediately preceding sentence, for any tax for which a monthly or quarterly return is required, or for which no return is required, the department shall add a failure to timely pay penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount shown as tax due on the return or the amount stated in the notice and demand.\n\n(2) If a taxpayer fails to pay to the department any amount of any tax required to be shown on any return, which is not so shown, within 30 calendar days from the date of the first notice and demand therefore, there shall be added as a penalty one percent of the amount of the tax due if the failure to pay is for not more than one month, with an additional one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which failure to pay continues, not exceeding 25 percent in the aggregate. In lieu of the penalty provided in the immediately preceding sentence, for any tax for which a monthly or quarterly return is required, or for which no return is required, the department shall add a failure to timely pay penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount stated in the notice and demand unless payment is received within 30 calendar days from the date of the first notice and demand.\n\n(c) Underpayment due to negligence. If any part of any underpayment of tax is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of that part of the tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, the term “negligence” includes any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with Title 40, and the term “disregard” includes any careless, reckless, or intentional disregard.\n\n(d) Underpayment due to fraud. If any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to 50 percent of that portion of the underpayment which is attributable to fraud.\n\nFor purposes of this section, the term “fraud” shall have the same meaning as ascribed to the term under 26 U.S.C. Section 6663, as in effect from time to time.\n\n(e) Frivolous return penalty. If a taxpayer files a “frivolous return,” as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. Section 6702, that taxpayer may be liable for a penalty of up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250).\n\n(f) Frivolous appeal penalty. If any appeal to the Alabama Tax Tribunal or circuit court is determined to be frivolous or primarily for the purpose of delay or to impede collection of any tax, a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or 25 percent of the tax in question, whichever is greater, shall be assessed in addition to any tax due.\n\n(g) Penalties not exclusive. The penalties provided in this section for failure to timely file a return, failure to timely pay tax, filing a frivolous return, filing a frivolous appeal, or negligence may be asserted against the same taxpayer for the same tax period.

This action may be brought by the department in the circuit court for the judicial circuit of the tax return preparer’s residence or principal place of business, or in which the taxpayer with respect to whose tax return the action is brought resides. The court may exercise its jurisdiction over the action separate and apart from any other action brought by the State of Alabama against the tax return preparer or any taxpayer.\n\n(2) In an action under this subsection, the court may issue an injunction prohibiting a person from acting as a tax return preparer if the court finds that the individual has done any of the following:\n\na. Engaged in any pattern of conduct subject to a civil penalty under subsection (a) or a violation of Section 40-29-115.\n\nb. Misrepresented the preparer’s eligibility to practice before the department, or otherwise misrepresented the preparer’s experience or education as a tax return preparer.\n\nc. Guaranteed the payment of any tax refund or the allowance of any tax credit.\n\nd. Aided or assisted in, counseled, or advised the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under, the state revenue laws, of any returns, affidavits, claims, or other documents, which may constitute a significant congruous pattern of any of the following:\n\n1. Omissions of income.\n\n2. Excessive or nonexistent deductions.\n\n3. Claims of nonexistent dependents.\n\n4. Fictitious business schedules.\n\n5. Excessive losses.\n\n6. Documents that are fraudulent or false as to any material matter, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present the return, affidavit, claim, or document.\n\n(d) For purposes of this section, the term “understatement of liability” means an understatement of the net amount payable with respect to the individual income tax imposed by Chapter 18, or an overstatement of the net amount creditable or refundable with respect to the individual income tax imposed by Chapter 18. The determination of whether there is an understatement of liability must be made without regard to any administrative or judicial action involving the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the amount determined as an underpayment of estimated income tax under either Sections 40-18-80 or 40-18-80.1 is not considered an understatement of liability.\n\n(e) For purposes of this section, the term “tax refund preparer,” “return preparer,” or “tax return preparer” means an individual who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more individuals who prepare for compensation, a tax return or a claim for refund of tax. The preparation of a substantial part of a return or claim for refund is treated as if it were the preparation of the entire return or claim for refund. An individual is not considered a tax return preparer merely because the individual does any of the following:\n\n(1) Furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance.\n\n(2) Prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, by whom the individual is regularly and continuously employed.\n\n(3) Prepares a return or claim for refund of any person as a fiduciary for that person.\n\n(4) Prepares a claim for refund for a taxpayer in response to an assessment issued to the taxpayer.\n\n(f)(1) A civil action in the name of the State of Alabama to enjoin any person from further engaging in conduct subject to penalty under 26 U.S.C. §6700, relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, or 26 U.S.C. §6701, relating to penalties for aiding and abetting understatement of tax liability, may be commenced at the request of the commissioner. Any action under this section shall be brought in the circuit court of Alabama for the judicial circuit in which that person resides, has his or her principal place of business, or has engaged in conduct subject to penalty under §6700 or §6701. The court may exercise its jurisdiction over such action separate and apart from any other action brought by the State of Alabama against that person.\n\n(2) In any action under subdivision (1), the court may enjoin a person from engaging in conduct or in any other activity subject to penalty under 26 U.S.C. §6700 or 26 U.S.C. §6701 if the court finds both of the following:\n\na. The person has engaged in any conduct subject to penalty under 26 U.S.C. §6700 or 26 U.S.C. §6701.\n\nb. Injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent recurrence of such conduct.\n\n(3) If any citizen or resident of the United States does not reside in, and does not have his or her principal place of business in, any Alabama judicial circuit, that citizen or resident shall be treated for purposes of this section as residing in Montgomery County.\n\n(g) This section shall apply solely to the individual income tax imposed by Chapter 18.\n\n(Act 2006-589, p. 1593, §1.)",

No taxpayer, however, shall be subject to unnecessary examination or investigation, and no more than one examination of a taxpayer’s books and records by each respective taxing entity relating to each type of tax shall be made every three taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests otherwise or unless the commissioner, or the corresponding governing body of a self-administered county or municipality, after investigation, notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional examination is necessary, together with the basis or bases for the additional examination.\n\n(c) The Department of Revenue and each governing body of a self-administered county or municipality shall promulgate regulations or procedures consistent with those followed by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to second examinations of a taxpayer’s books and records. Provided, however, an examination of a taxpayer’s books and records may be conducted and shall not constitute an unnecessary examination pursuant to this section or the Alabama Taxpayers’ Bill of Rights and Uniform Revenue Procedures Act if the examination is necessary to meet one or more of the following criteria: (i) fulfill an obligation to another state pursuant to a Southeastern Association of Tax Administrators (“SEATA”) exchange of information agreement or to the Multistate Tax Commission; (ii) follow up on leads furnished by the Multistate Tax Commission or pursuant to a SEATA exchange agreement; (iii) verify a direct or joint refund claim and to determine if there is any offsetting tax liability to be credited against or that may exceed the refund claim; (iv) secure a tax return and the tax, penalty, interest, and service charge, if any, due thereon for any reporting period for which the taxpayer has failed to file a return by the due date of the return; (v) collect any tax, penalty, interest, or service charge which the taxpayer has failed to remit within 30 days after receiving notification that the amount is due; (vi) secure a corrected return and the additional tax, penalty, interest, or service charge due thereon, if any, when the taxpayer has failed to file a corrected return and remit any additional amount due thereon within 30 days of receiving a request for a corrected return; (vii) collect any tax due based upon substantial evidence of fraud or tax evasion discovered since the prior examination, and then only if the Department of Revenue or the governing body of the self-administered municipality or county explains to the taxpayer in writing the basis for the alleged fraud or tax evasion; or (viii) follow up on representations by the taxpayer that it is going out of business or the taxpayer has gone out of business.\n\n(d) Any person examining a taxpayer’s books and records on behalf of a self-administered municipality or county shall disclose in writing, upon first contact with the taxpayer, the identity of the self-administered municipalities and counties represented, and provide signed and dated written authorization, or a copy of signed and dated written authorization, from each self-administered municipality and county represented.
