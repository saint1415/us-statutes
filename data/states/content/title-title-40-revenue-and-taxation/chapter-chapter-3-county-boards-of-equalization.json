At the hearing of these protests, beginning on the date specified by the Department of Revenue following the making of the assessments as herein elsewhere provided, the board of equalization shall accord each a reasonable time and opportunity within which to be heard, taking into consideration the total time available for hearing the protests, the number of protests pending, the amount and nature of the property involved in the given assessment, and all other relevant circumstances.

      "text": "Section 40-3-26\n\nAppeals - Legal Counsel for State and County.\n\n(a) The county commission shall be responsible for securing legal counsel to represent the state and county in all property tax cases appealed to the circuit court in the county. The district attorneys and state and county officials are prohibited from representing taxpayers in any controversy between taxpayers and the state or county. However, a district attorney or county official may appear where the value of his or her own property is in controversy. The county may retain legal counsel to handle a property tax appeal or, when available pursuant to coverage provided by a self-insurance fund created under Chapter 30 of Title 11, utilize legal counsel provided through that coverage. In each case where the county commission employs its own legal counsel for a property tax case appeal, the county commission, in consultation with the local tax official, shall adopt a resolution approving the employment of the counsel. All expenses incurred by the county commission in complying with this section shall be paid from the budget of the county board of equalization as provided in Section 40-7-68.\n\n(b) In addition to the appearance specifications provided in Section 40-3-25, the county tax assessing official may appear in his or her official capacity and defend on behalf of the state in any appeal in which the taxable value of real or personal property is at issue. The appearance of the tax assessing official in the action shall be considered an appearance of the state, unless the Department of Revenue files a notice of appearance or subsequently intervenes on behalf of the state. The tax assessing official may act in the appeal as appropriate and necessary to defend the taxable value of real or personal property. The appearance provided for in this subsection shall not extend beyond this section unless otherwise provided by law.\n\n(c) In addition to all other powers granted to the board of trustees of a self-insurance fund created pursuant to Chapter 30 of Title 11, the board of trustees of the fund may provide legal counsel for property tax cases appealed to the circuit court. Coverage, when available, shall be treated as a claim filed under Chapter 30.\n\n(Acts 1935, No. 194, p. 256; Code 1940, T. 51, §113; Act 2016-127, p. 287, §1; Act 2022-183, §1.)",

Failure to disclose this information at the time the sale or lease transaction is offered into evidence shall result in the proffered evidence being deemed inadmissible.\n\n(Act 2018-265, §1.)",
