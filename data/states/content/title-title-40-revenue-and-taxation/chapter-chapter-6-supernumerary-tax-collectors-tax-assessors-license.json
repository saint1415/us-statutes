The sum shall be deducted on a pro rata millage basis from payments to the state, county, and all subdivisions and agencies thereof, except municipalities, to which the person collecting ad valorem taxes is charged with the distributing of ad valorem taxes collected under the law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the official dies without leaving a surviving spouse, or otherwise becomes disqualified as a supernumerary official, any money remaining in the fund shall be refunded to the person by whom it is paid to the county, and the person shall distribute the money refunded to the state, county, and other subdivisions and agencies on the same pro rata millage basis that it was originally withheld.\n\nIf any official covered under this chapter dies prior to attaining the age of 60 years, but being otherwise qualified to be appointed a supernumerary official, except for age, and is survived by a spouse lawfully married to the official at the time of his or her death, then the surviving spouse shall be paid a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of the salary which would have been paid to the official had he or she survived to the age of 60. The monthly allowance shall be paid in the same manner as provided for payment to a qualified official and shall continue for 15 years or until the marriage of the surviving spouse, whichever first occurs. Upon the death of any official covered under this chapter after he or she has become fully qualified for appointment as a supernumerary official, including age, whether appointed as a supernumerary official or whether still serving in active office, the surviving spouse of the official shall be paid a monthly allowance equal to 50 percent of the supernumerary salary being paid to the official or to which he or she would be entitled if appointed as supernumerary. The monthly allowance shall be paid in the same manner as provided for the official and shall continue for 15 years or until the marriage of the surviving spouse, whichever first occurs.\n\n(b) Beginning with the fiscal year commencing on October 1, 2006, the supernumerary officials of a county provided for in this section shall be entitled to receive the same cost-of-living increases in compensation, that are granted to county retirees by the county commission, if approved by a resolution of a majority of the county commission.

If any person coming under this chapter shall end his or her tenure of office prior to becoming supernumerary as provided in Section 40-6-1, the official whose tenure of office has ended may elect to have the total amount paid by him or her refunded or, if qualified by length of service but not age, may elect to wait until reaching age 60 and then receive the annual salary as provided for in Section 40-6-3. In the event the person dies in office prior to becoming supernumerary, and leaves no surviving spouse, the amount paid in by him or her shall be paid to his or her estate.

In the event an official dies in office prior to serving the minimum length of time to qualify as a supernumerary, and leaves a surviving spouse, the amount paid in by him or her shall be paid to the surviving spouse. Any person desiring to come under this chapter pursuant to subdivisions (a)(2) or (b) of Section 40-6-1, shall pay to the county tax collector such proportionate sum as to equal the amount he or she would have been required to pay if he or she were employed as a tax collector, tax assessor, revenue commissioner, license commissioner, or other elected or appointed official charged with the assessment or collection, or both, of ad valorem taxes of the county, and the proportionate sum shall be distributed by the tax collector as provided in this section.\n\n(Acts 1967, No. 755, p. 1609, §4; Acts 1971, No. 1943, p. 3138, §1; Acts 1977, No. 309, p. 410, §3; Acts 1983, No. 83-643, p. 999, §3; Acts 1988, 1st Ex.
