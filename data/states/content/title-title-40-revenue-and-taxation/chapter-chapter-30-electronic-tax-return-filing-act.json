      "text": "Section 40-30-2\n\nPurpose and Legislative Intent.\n\n(a) Purpose. The purpose of the Electronic Tax Return Filing Act is to authorize the Department of Revenue to accept tax returns and other documents of all types filed in electronic commerce without violating other statutes originally drafted for the use of paper returns submitted either personally or through the mail.\n\n(b) Intent of the Legislature. It is recognized that because of constant technological advances, the statutory outline herein for filing tax returns and other documents electronically cannot encompass all of the intricacies in requirements or qualifications currently or into the future. The bulk of the requirements and qualifications must be implemented through the Department of Revenue’s authority to promulgate regulations hereunder. It is the intent of the Legislature to allow the Department of Revenue the necessary flexibility to adopt specific regulations for accepting tax returns by electronic media, to control the integrity of the data submitted, to reduce processing costs and processing times, to aid accuracy, reduce complexities of filing, expedite the processing of refunds to taxpayers, and to update signature and return requirements.\n\n(Acts 1997, No. 97-493, p. 878, §2.)",

      "text": "Section 40-30-6\n\nQualification of Electronic Return Originators, Transmitters and Software Developers.\n\n(a) Generally. Qualified electronic return originators, qualified transmitters, and qualified software developers serve as agents of the Department of Revenue. Qualification with the department as an electronic return originator, transmitter, or software developer does not involve a property right of the party so qualified and such qualification may be revoked by the department at any time. The department may by regulation provide specific and general requirements for qualifications.\n\n(b) Qualification. An entity or person may be qualified with the department as an electronic return originator, a transmitter, or as a software developer upon notification of the entity’s or person’s application. If the application for qualification is not accepted by the department, the party making the application may appeal the decision of the department pursuant to Section 40-2A-8. The department may promulgate regulations for the qualifications of electronic return originators, transmitters, and software developers. The failure of the applicant to meet minimum requirements for electronic return originators, transmitters, or software developers is reasonable cause for the department to deny the application for qualification or to revoke a previously granted application.\n\n(c) Revocation of Qualification for Cause. The department may revoke an accepted qualification at any time for cause. Revocation for cause includes but is not limited to actual fraud or failure to adhere to any regulations of the department. An electronic return originator, transmitter, or software developer whose qualification has been revoked by the department is to be notified of the revocation of qualification by certified mail to their last known address or by actual notice. An entity whose qualification has been revoked may appeal the revocation of qualifications for cause by the same process and subject to the same limitations as an appeal under Section 40-2A-8. A revocation of qualification shall be effective upon the mailing of the revocation notice. This revocation of qualification may be stayed only as provided by subsection (d) of this section during the pendency of any appeal of the decision to revoke their qualification. A revocation of qualification for cause will not be considered a waiver of any other remedy at law or equity which the department may pursue against the party whose qualification is revoked.\n\n(d) Temporary Qualification during Pendency of Appeal from Revocation of Qualification for Cause. If requested by the electronic return originator, transmitter, or software developer a temporary qualification may be granted by the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue to be effective during the pendency of the appeal. As a consideration in the grant of a temporary qualification, the commissioner may require a bond and personal guarantees to protect the interest of the department during the pendency of the appeal. The decision of the commissioner as to whether to grant the temporary qualification is final.\n\n(Acts 1997, No. 97-493, p. 878, §6.)",
