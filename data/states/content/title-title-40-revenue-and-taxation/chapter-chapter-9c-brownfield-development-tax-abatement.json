A reduction or elimination of a taxpayer’s liability for tax. An abatement of local and noneducation transaction taxes imposed under Chapter 23 of this title shall relieve the seller from the obligation to collect and pay over the local portion of the noneducation transaction tax as if the sale were to a person exempt, to the extent of the abatement, from the local portion of the noneducation transaction tax.\n\n(2) BROWNFIELD DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY.
