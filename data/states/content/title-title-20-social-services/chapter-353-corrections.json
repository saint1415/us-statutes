(b) Unless the hearing is waived, the court shall hear the petition as soon as possible and no later than ten days after the date the petition is filed unless a reasonable delay is sought for good cause shown by the person who is the subject of the petition, the person's attorney, the petitioner, the guardian or guardian ad litem, or those persons entitled to receive notice of the hearing under section 353-13.8. (c) The person who is the subject of the petition shall be present at all hearings unless the person waives the right to be present, is unable to attend, or creates conditions that make it impossible to conduct the hearing in a reasonable manner as determined by the court. A waiver is valid only upon acceptance by the court following a judicial determination that the person understands the person's rights and is competent to waive them, or is unable to participate. At any point during the proceedings and after the filing of the petition, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem or a temporary guardian, as provided in article V of chapter 560, to represent the person throughout the proceedings, if the court finds that the person is unable to participate or that other good cause exists. (d) Hearings may be held at a convenient location within the circuit where the person who is the subject of the petition resides or any other circuit deemed appropriate by the court.
