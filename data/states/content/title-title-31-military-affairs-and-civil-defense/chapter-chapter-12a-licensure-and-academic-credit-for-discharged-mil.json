      "text": "Section 31-12A-1\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature recognizes the importance of active military personnel, veterans, and military facilities to the well-being, safety, and economic development of the State of Alabama. The Legislature further recognizes and finds that discharged service members leave the military with documented training and experience that can prepare them for civilian employment; however, this documentation is not always able to result in qualifying them for licenses required for their occupation or providing them with academic credit. By providing for expedited licensure and increased academic credit recognition for a service member’s military training and experience, the state can help promote the employment of veterans.\n\n(Act 2013-350, p. 1255, §1.)",
