If a situation occurs for which I have not expressed a preference, or in the event my preference is not available, my mental health care agent should think about what action would be consistent with past conversations we have had, my treatment preferences as expressed in PART ONE, my religious and other beliefs and values, and how I have handled medical and other important issues in the past. If what I would decide is still unclear, then my mental health care agent should make decisions for me that my mental health care agent believes are in my best interests, considering the benefits, burdens, and risks of my current circumstances and treatment options.I impose the following limitations on my agent's authority to act on my behalf:______________________________________________________(10)WHEN SPOUSE IS MENTAL HEALTH CARE AGENT AND THERE HAS BEEN A DIVORCE OR ANNULMENT OF OUR MARRIAGE[Initial if you agree with this statement; leave blank if you do not.]__________________ I desire the person I have named as my agent, who is now my spouse, to remain as my agent even if we become divorced or our marriage is annulled.PART THREE: OTHER RELATED ISSUES[PART THREE is optional.This psychiatric advance directive will be effective even if PART THREE is left blank.](11)GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENTI typically react to law enforcement in the following ways:______________________________________________________The following person(s) may be helpful in the event of law enforcement involvement:Name: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________Relationship: __________________Name: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________Relationship: __________________(12)HELP FROM OTHERSThe following people are part of my support system (child care, pet care, getting my mail, paying my bills, etc.) and should be contacted in the event of a crisis:Name: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________Responsibility: __________________Name: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________Responsibility: __________________Name: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________Responsibility: __________________PART FOUR: EFFECTIVENESS AND SIGNATURESThis psychiatric advance directive will become effective only if I have been determined in the opinion of a physician or licensed psychologist who has personally examined me, or in the opinion of a court, to lack the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of, and the alternatives to, a mental health care decision under consideration and I am unable to give or communicate rational reasons for my mental health care decisions because of impaired thinking, impaired ability to receive and evaluate information, or other cognitive disability.This form revokes any psychiatric advance directive that I have executed before this date.

If you are not married, a future marriage will revoke the selection of your mental health care agent unless the person you selected as your mental health care agent is your new spouse.]\n\nI select the following person as my mental health care agent to make mental health care decisions for me:\n\nName: __________________\n\nAddress: __________________\n\nTelephone Numbers: __________________\n\n(Home, Work, and Mobile)\n\nAgent's Acceptance: I have read this form, and I certify that I do not, have not, and will not provide mental health care and treatment for:(your name)__________________\n\nI accept the designation as agent for:(your name)__________________\n\n(Agent's signature and date)__________________\n\n[This section is optional.PART TWO will be effective even if this section is left blank.]\n\nIf my mental health care agent cannot be contacted in a reasonable time period and cannot be located with reasonable efforts or for any reason my mental health care agent is unavailable or unable or unwilling to act as my mental health care agent, then I select the following, each to act successively in the order named, as my back-up mental health care agent(s):\n\nName: __________________\n\nAddress: __________________\n\nTelephone Numbers: __________________\n\n(Home, Work, and Mobile)\n\nBack-up Agent's Acceptance: I have read this form, and I certify that I do not, have not, and will not provide mental health care and treatment for:(your name)__________________\n\nI accept the designation as agent for:(your name)__________________\n\n(Back-up agent's signature and date)__________________\n\nName: __________________\n\nAddress: __________________\n\nTelephone Numbers: __________________\n\n(Home, Work, and Mobile)\n\nBack-up Agent's Acceptance: I have read this form, and I certify that I do not, have not, and will not provide mental health care and treatment for:(your name)__________________\n\nI accept the designation as agent for:(your name)__________________\n\n(Back-up agent's signature and date)__________________\n\nMy mental health care agent will make mental health care decisions for me when I have been determined in the opinion of a physician or licensed psychologist who has personally examined me, or in the opinion of a court, to lack the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of, and the alternatives to, a mental health care treatment decision under consideration and I am unable to give or communicate rational reasons for my mental health care decisions because of impaired thinking, impaired ability to receive and evaluate information, or other cognitive disability.\n\nMy mental health care agent will have the same authority to make any mental health care decision that I could make. My mental health care agent's authority includes, for example, the power to:\n\n*Request and consent to admission or discharge from any facility;\n\n*Request, consent to, authorize, or withdraw consent to any type of provider or mental health care that is consistent with my instructions in PART ONE of this form and subject to the limitations set forth in Section (4) of PART ONE; and\n\n*Contract for any health care facility or service for me, and to obligate me to pay for these services (and my mental health care agent will not be financially liable for any services or care contracted for me or on my behalf).\n\nMy mental health care agent will be my personal representative for all purposes of federal or state law related to privacy of medical records (including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) and will have the same access to my medical records that I have and can disclose the contents of my medical records to others for my ongoing mental health care.\n\nMy mental health care agent may accompany me in an ambulance or air ambulance if in the opinion of the ambulance personnel protocol permits a passenger, and my mental health care agent may visit or consult with me in person while I am in a facility if its protocol permits visitation.\n\nMy mental health care agent may present a copy of this psychiatric advance directive in lieu of the original, and the copy will have the same meaning and effect as the original.\n\nI understand that under Georgia law:\n\n*My mental health care agent may refuse to act as my mental health care agent; and\n\n*A court can take away the powers of my mental health care agent if it finds that my mental health care agent is not acting in accordance with this directive.\n\nIn the event my directive is being used, my agent should first look at my instructions as expressed in PART ONE. If a situation occurs for which I have not expressed a preference, or in the event my preference is not available, my mental health care agent should think about what action would be consistent with past conversations we have had, my treatment preferences as expressed in PART ONE, my religious and other beliefs and values, and how I have handled medical and other important issues in the past. If what I would decide is still unclear, then my mental health care agent should make decisions for me that my mental health care agent believes are in my best interests, considering the benefits, burdens, and risks of my current circumstances and treatment options.\n\nI impose the following limitations on my agent's authority to act on my behalf:\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n[Initial if you agree with this statement; leave blank if you do not.]\n\n__________________ I desire the person I have named as my agent, who is now my spouse, to remain as my agent even if we become divorced or our marriage is annulled.\n\nPART THREE: OTHER RELATED ISSUES\n\n[PART THREE is optional.This psychiatric advance directive will be effective even if PART THREE is left blank.]\n\nI typically react to law enforcement in the following ways:\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\nThe following person(s) may be helpful in the event of law enforcement involvement:\n\nName: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________\n\nRelationship: __________________\n\nName: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________\n\nRelationship: __________________\n\nThe following people are part of my support system (child care, pet care, getting my mail, paying my bills, etc.) and should be contacted in the event of a crisis:\n\nName: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________\n\nResponsibility: __________________\n\nName: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________\n\nResponsibility: __________________\n\nName: __________________ Telephone Number: __________________\n\nResponsibility: __________________\n\nPART FOUR: EFFECTIVENESS AND SIGNATURES\n\nThis psychiatric advance directive will become effective only if I have been determined in the opinion of a physician or licensed psychologist who has personally examined me, or in the opinion of a court, to lack the capacity to understand the risks and benefits of, and the alternatives to, a mental health care decision under consideration and I am unable to give or communicate rational reasons for my mental health care decisions because of impaired thinking, impaired ability to receive and evaluate information, or other cognitive disability.\n\nThis form revokes any psychiatric advance directive that I have executed before this date. To the extent this form is in conflict or is inconsistent with any advance directive for health care, durable power of attorney for health care, health care proxy, or living will executed by me at any time, this form shall control with respect to my mental health care.\n\nUnless I have initialed below and have provided alternative future dates or events, this psychiatric advance directive will become effective at the time I sign it and will remain effective until my death.\n\n(Initials) __________________ This psychiatric advance directive will become effective on or upon (date) __________________ and will terminate on or upon (date)__________________.\n\n[You must sign and date or acknowledge signing and dating this form in the presence of two witnesses.\n\nBoth witnesses must be of sound mind and must be at least 18 years of age, but the witnesses do not have to be together or present with you when you sign this form.\n\n*Cannot be a person who was selected to be your mental health care agent or back-up mental health care agent in PART TWO;\n\n*Cannot be a provider who is providing mental health care to you at the time you execute this directive or an employee of such provider unless the witness is your family member, friend, or associate and is not directly involved in your mental health care; and\n\n*Cannot be an employee of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities or of a local public mental health agency or of any organization that contracts with a local public mental health authority unless the witness is your family member, friend, or associate and is not directly involved in your mental health care.]\n\nBy signing below, I state that I am of sound mind and capable of making this psychiatric advance directive and that I understand its purpose and effect.\n\n__________________ __________________\n\n(Signature of Declarant) (Date)\n\nThe declarant signed this form in my presence or acknowledged signing this form to me.
