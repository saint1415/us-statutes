If a majority of the votes cast on that question are in favor of the proposition to detach, the same shall be deemed carried, and the territory shall thereupon cease to be within the drainage district, and shall stand in the same plight as if never attached. The officers of the district shall certify the same to the county clerk, who shall make a record thereof.SourceLaws 1909, c. 150, § 1, p. 532;R.S.1913, § 1903;C.S.1922, § 1851;C.S.1929, § 31-539;R.S.1943, § 31-439.",
