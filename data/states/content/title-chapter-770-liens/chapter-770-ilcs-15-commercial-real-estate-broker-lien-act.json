The requirement to establish an escrow account,\nas provided for in this Section, shall not be cause for any party to refuse\nto close the transaction. These monies shall be held in escrow until the\nparties' rights to the escrowed monies have been determined by written\nagreement of the parties, a court of law, or other process as may be agreed\nto by the parties. Upon funds in the amount of the claimed lien being\nescrowed, a release of the claim for lien shall be provided by the broker\nclaiming the lien. The parties are not required to follow this escrow\nprocedure if alternative procedures which would allow the transaction to\nclose are available and are acceptable to the transferee in the\ntransaction. If the proceeds from the transaction are insufficient to\nrelease all liens claimed against the commercial real estate, including the\nbroker's lien, then the parties are not required to follow this escrow\nprocedure in the Section.",
