If the original financing statement or currently effective continuation statement was filed in multiple counties, then such continuation statement may be filed in any of such multiple counties, except where the original financing statement or currently effective continuation statement covers crops growing or to be grown, or minerals or the like, including oil and gas, or accounts subject to subsection (5) of Code Section11-9-103, or was filed as a fixture filing (Code Section11-9-313), then such continuation statement must be filed in each of such counties where any of the related real estate is located. This continuation statement must contain the information required by the first sentence of subsection (1) of Code Section11-9-402, other than a statement indicating the types, or describing the items, of collateral and the social security number or Internal Revenue Service taxpayer identification number of the debtor, and must further identify the original financing statement or currently effective continuation statement, the office where such financing statement or continuation statement was filed, and the filing number and date of filing or other recording information, and further state that the original financing statement is still effective. Except as specified in this subsection, the provisions of subsection (3) of Code Section11-9-403for continuation statements apply to such a statement.(3)Statements of amendment, assignment, release, or termination affecting original financing statements filed prior to January 1, 1995, (\"transitional filings\") shall be filed on the forms prescribed by the Georgia Superior Court Clerks' Cooperative Authority with the filing officer of the county where the original financing statement was filed, or if the original financing statement has previously been continued, where the currently effective continuation statement was filed.

Each transitional filing shall identify the original financing statement or currently effective continuation statement, the office where such financing statement or continuation statement was filed, the filing number or other recording information, and identify each named debtor and secured party. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (2) of Code Section11-9-405or Code Section11-9-406, no social security number or Internal Revenue Service taxpayer identification number of the debtor shall be required to be included in any such transitional filings.
