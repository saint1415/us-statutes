Pan v. IOC Realty Specialist, 301 Neb. 256, 918 N.W.2d 273 (2018).\"Tenant,\" as defined under this section as a person entitled under a rental agreement to occupy any premises for rent or storage uses to the exclusion of others \"whether such premises are used as a dwelling unit or self-service storage unit or facility or not,\" does not limit the application of the Disposition of Personal Property Landlord and Tenant Act to leases in nature of dwelling unit or self-service storage unit. Rather, the language \"whether or not\" indicates that it is not important which of the possibilities were true. Pan v. IOC Realty Specialist, 301 Neb. 256, 918 N.W.2d 273 (2018).The definition of landlord under this section clearly includes agents under its scope. Pan v.
