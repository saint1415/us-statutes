No creditor, servicer, or its institution shall be required to contribute to the funding of any nonprofit organization that provides counseling required pursuant to this paragraph;(8)A creditor shall not make a high-cost home loan unless a reasonable creditor would believe at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower residing in the home will be able to make the scheduled payments associated with the loan based upon a consideration of his or her current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, other than the borrower's equity in the collateral that secures repayment of the loan. There is a rebuttable presumption that the borrower residing in the home is able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, said borrower's total monthly debts, including amounts under the loan, do not exceed 50 percent of said borrower's monthly gross income as verified by tax returns, payroll receipts, and other third-party income verification;(9)A creditor or servicer shall not pay a contractor under a home improvement contract from the proceeds of a high-cost home loan unless:(A)The creditor or servicer is presented with an affidavit of the contractor that the work has been completed, which affidavit meets the requirements of Code Section44-14-361.2; and(B)The proceeds are disbursed in an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor or, at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the drafter of the instrument, and the contractor prior to the disbursement;(10)A creditor or servicer shall not charge a borrower any fees or other charges to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost home loan or to defer any payment due under the terms of a high-cost home loan;(11)A creditor who makes a high-cost home loan and who has the legal right to foreclose shall provide notice of the intent to foreclose to the borrower in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the borrower last known to the creditor.

Cure of default as provided in this paragraph shall reinstate the borrower to the same position as if the default had not occurred and shall nullify as of the date of the cure any acceleration of any obligation under the security instrument or note arising from the default;(13)(A)To cure a default under this Code section, a borrower shall not be required to pay any charge, fee, or penalty attributable to the exercise of the right to cure a default as provided for in this Code section, other than the fees specifically allowed by this Code section. The borrower shall not be liable for any attorneys' fees relating to the borrower's default that are incurred by the creditor or servicer prior to or during the 30 day period set forth in this paragraph, nor for any such fees in excess of $100.00 that are incurred by the creditor or servicer after the expiration of the 30 day period but prior to the time the creditor or servicer files a foreclosure action or takes other action to seize or transfer ownership of the home.

If the amount necessary to cure the default will change during the 30 day period after the effective date of the notice due to the application of a daily interest rate or the addition of late fees as allowed by this chapter, the notice shall give sufficient information to enable the borrower to calculate the amount at any point during the 30 day period;(ii)The date by which the borrower shall cure the default to avoid acceleration and initiation of foreclosure or other action to seize the home which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made;(iii)That, if the borrower does not cure the default by the date specified, the creditor or servicer may take steps to terminate the borrower's ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize the home; and(iv)The name and address of the creditor or servicer and the telephone number of a representative of the creditor or servicer whom the borrower may contact if the borrower disagrees with the creditor's or servicer's assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the creditor's or servicer's calculation of the amount required to cure the default;(14)A high-cost home loan shall not contain nor shall a creditor or servicer enforce a provision that permits a creditor or servicer, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness.

If the amount necessary to cure the default will change during the 30 day period after the effective date of the notice due to the application of a daily interest rate or the addition of late fees as allowed by this chapter, the notice shall give sufficient information to enable the borrower to calculate the amount at any point during the 30 day period;(ii)The date by which the borrower shall cure the default to avoid acceleration and initiation of foreclosure or other action to seize the home which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made;(iii)That, if the borrower does not cure the default by the date specified, the creditor or servicer may take steps to terminate the borrower's ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize the home; and(iv)The name and address of the creditor or servicer and the telephone number of a representative of the creditor or servicer whom the borrower may contact if the borrower disagrees with the creditor's or servicer's assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the creditor's or servicer's calculation of the amount required to cure the default;(14)A high-cost home loan shall not contain nor shall a creditor or servicer enforce a provision that permits a creditor or servicer, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness.
