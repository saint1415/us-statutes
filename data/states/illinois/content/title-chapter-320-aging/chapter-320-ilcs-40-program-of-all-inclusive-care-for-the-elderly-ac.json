The PACE program is\npart of a national replication project authorized in Section 9412(b)(2) of\nthe federal Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986, which\ninstructs the Secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human\nServices to grant Medicare and Medicaid waivers to permit not more than 10\npublic or nonprofit private community-based organizations in the country to\nprovide comprehensive health care services on a capitated basis to frail\nelderly who are at risk of institutionalization. The General Assembly\nfinds that by coordinating an extensive array of medical and nonmedical\nservices, the needs of the participants will be met primarily in an\noutpatient environment in an adult day health center, in their homes, or in\nan institutional setting. The General Assembly finds that such a service\ndelivery system will enhance the quality of life for the participant and\noffers the potential to reduce and cap costs to Illinois of the medical\nneeds of the participants, including hospital and nursing home admissions.",
