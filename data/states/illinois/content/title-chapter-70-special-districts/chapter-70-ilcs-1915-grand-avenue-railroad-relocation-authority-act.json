The Village of Franklin Park\nby reason of the location there of Grand Avenue and its use for vehicular\ntravel in access to the entire west metropolitan Chicago area, including\nmunicipalities in 2 counties, as well as commercial and industrial growth\npatterns and accessibility to O'Hare International Airport and massive freight\nrelated services, has become and will increasingly be the hub of transportation\nfrom all parts of the region and throughout the west metropolitan area.\nMotor vehicle traffic, pedestrian travel and the safety of both motorists and\npedestrians are substantially aggravated by the location of major railroad\nrights of way that divide the Village east from west and north from south.\nThose railroad rights of way have effectively impeded the development of\nhighway usage and rights of way to further and enhance growth throughout the\nregion. For the safety of the public it has been necessary to provide large\nnumbers of protected crossings at great expense to the railroads, but often\nwithout complete safety to the public. The presence of the railroad rights of\nway at grade crossings within the Village is detrimental to the orderly\nexpansion of industry and commerce and to progress of the region. To alleviate\nthis situation it is necessary to relocate the railroad tracks and right of way\non Grand Avenue and to separate the grades at crossings and to acquire property\nfor relocation or submergence of the railroad or highways and to create an\nagency to facilitate and accomplish that relocation.",
