The Authority shall have the power to acquire by gift, purchase, legacy, or by the exercise of eminent domain the fee simple title to real property located within the boundaries of the Authority, including temporary and permanent easements, as well as reversionary interests in the streets, alleys, and other public places and personal property, required for its purposes, and title thereto shall be taken in the corporate name of the Authority. Any such property that is already devoted to a public use may nevertheless be acquired, provided that no property belonging to the United States of America or the State of Illinois may be acquired without the consent of such governmental unit. No property devoted to a public use belonging to a corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Commerce Commission may be acquired without a prior finding by the Illinois Commerce Commission that the taking would not result in the imposition of an undue burden on intrastate commerce. Eminent domain proceedings shall be conducted in all respects in the manner provided for the exercise of the right of the eminent domain under the Eminent Domain Act. No condemnation proceedings for the acquisition of new property shall be instituted without the prior concurrence of the affected Railroads in the route, width and title to be acquired thereby. Consistent with the Land Acquisition and Procedures Manual prepared by the Department of Transportation and updated through October 23, 2012, when a railroad company owns the fee title to its operating right-of-way and such property is acquired by the Authority to construct a grade separation facility, no compensation of any kind shall be made to the railroad to construct a grade separation facility where an existing highway crossing is eliminated; however, consideration shall be given if the size of the acquisition is different than the original right-of-way. All land and appurtenances thereto, acquired or owned by the Authority, are to be deemed acquired or owned for a public use or public purpose.",
