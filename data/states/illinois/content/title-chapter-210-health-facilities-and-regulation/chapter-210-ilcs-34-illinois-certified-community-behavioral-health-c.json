The Strategy shall consolidate required pilots and initiatives into a cohesive behavioral health system designed to serve both adults and children in the least restrictive setting, as early as possible, once behavioral health needs have been identified, and through evidence-informed practices identified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and other national experts. The Strategy shall take into consideration initiatives such as the Healthcare Transformation Collaboratives program; integrated health homes; services offered under federal Medicaid waiver authorities, including Sections 1915(i) and 1115 of the Social Security Act; requirements for certified community behavioral health centers; enhanced team-based services; housing and employment supports; and other initiatives identified by customers and stakeholders. The Strategy shall also identify the proper capacity for residential and institutional services while emphasizing serving customers in the community.",
