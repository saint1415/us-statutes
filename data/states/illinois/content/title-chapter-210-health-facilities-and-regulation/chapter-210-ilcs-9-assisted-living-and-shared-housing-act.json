      "text": "The purpose of this Act is to permit the\ndevelopment and\navailability of assisted living establishments and shared housing\nestablishments\nbased on a social\nmodel that promotes the dignity, individuality, privacy, independence,\nautonomy, and decision-making ability and the right to negotiated risk of\nthose persons; to provide\nfor the health, safety,\nand welfare of those residents residing in assisted living and shared housing\nestablishments in\nthis State; to promote continuous quality improvement in assisted living; and\nto encourage the\ndevelopment of innovative and affordable assisted living establishments and\nshared housing\nwith service establishments for elderly persons of all income levels. It is\nthe public policy of\nthis State that assisted living is an important part of the continuum of\nlong term care. In support\nof the goal of aging in place within the parameters established by this Act,\nassisted living\nand shared housing establishments shall be operated as\nresidential environments\nwith supportive services designed to meet the individual resident's changing\nneeds and\npreferences. The residential environment shall be designed to encourage family\nand community\ninvolvement. The services available to residents, either directly or through\ncontracts or\nagreements, are intended to help residents remain as independent as possible.\nAssisted living,\nwhich promotes resident choice, autonomy, and decision making, should be based\non a contract\nmodel designed to result in a negotiated agreement between the resident or\nthe resident's\nrepresentative and the provider, clearly identifying the services to be\nprovided. This model\nassumes that residents are able to direct services provided for them and will\ndesignate a\nrepresentative to direct\nthese services if they themselves are unable to do so. This model supports\nthe\nprinciple that there is\nan acceptable balance between consumer protection and resident willingness\nto accept risk and\nthat most consumers are competent to make their own judgments about the\nservices they are\nobtaining. Regulation of assisted living establishments and shared housing\nestablishments must\nbe sufficiently flexible to allow residents to age in place within the\nparameters of this Act.\nThe\nadministration of this Act and services provided must therefore ensure that the\nresidents have the rights and responsibilities to direct the scope of services\nthey\nreceive and to make individual choices based on their needs and preferences.\nThese\nestablishments shall be operated in a manner that provides the least\nrestrictive and\nmost homelike environment and that promotes independence, autonomy,\nindividuality,\nprivacy, dignity, and the right to negotiated risk in residential\nsurroundings. It is not the intent of the State that establishments licensed\nunder this Act\nbe used as halfway houses for alcohol and substance abusers.",
