The\nresults of any major interruption of telecommunications services can be\ncatastrophic. It is therefore crucial that the State of Illinois take all\nreasonable actions to provide assurances that appropriate protective\nmechanisms are in place to prevent major interruptions of\ntelecommunications services and to provide assurances of a proper emergency\nresponse if such protective mechanisms fail. The intent of this Act is to\nauthorize the three State agencies most directly responsible for\ntelecommunications, fire prevention, and emergency services, respectively,\nto develop joint rules and implement enforcement action where necessary to\nprovide such assurances.",
