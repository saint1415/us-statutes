      "text": "The General Assembly previously imposed a\ntax on the invested capital of electric utilities to replace in part the\npersonal property tax that was abolished by the Illinois Constitution of 1970.\nSubsequent to the enactment and imposition of the invested capital tax on\nelectric utilities, State and federal laws regulating the provision of\nelectricity have been enacted which provide for the restructuring of the\nelectric power industry into a competitive industry. In response to this\nrestructuring, this amendatory Act of 1997 is intended to provide for a\nreplacement for the\ninvested capital tax on electric utilities, other than electric cooperatives,\nand replace it with a new tax based on the quantity of electricity that is\ndelivered in this State. The General Assembly finds and declares that this new\ntax is a fairer and more equitable means to replace that portion of the\npersonal property tax that was abolished by the Illinois Constitution of 1970\nand previously replaced by the invested capital tax on electric utilities,\nwhile maintaining a comparable allocation among electric utilities in this\nState for payment of taxes imposed to replace the personal property tax.",
