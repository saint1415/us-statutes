      "text": "and\nshall continue to have primary responsibility for investigating, indicting,\nand prosecuting persons who violate the criminal laws of the State of\nIllinois. However, in recent years organized terrorist activity directed\nagainst innocent civilians and certain criminal enterprises have\ndeveloped that require investigation, indictment, and prosecution on a\nstatewide or multicounty level. The criminal enterprises exist\nas a result of the\nallure of profitability present in narcotic activity, the unlawful sale and\ntransfer of firearms, and streetgang related felonies and organized terrorist\nactivity is supported by the contribution of money and expert assistance from\ngeographically diverse sources. In\norder to shut off the life blood of terrorism and\nweaken or eliminate the criminal enterprises, assets, and\nproperty\nused to further these offenses must be frozen, and any profit must be\nremoved. State\nstatutes exist that can accomplish that goal. Among them are the offense of\nmoney laundering, violations\nof Article 29D of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, the\nNarcotics Profit Forfeiture Act, and gunrunning. Local prosecutors need\ninvestigative personnel and specialized training to attack and eliminate these\nprofits. In light of the transitory and complex nature of conduct that\nconstitutes these criminal activities, the many diverse property interests that\nmay be used, acquired directly or indirectly as a result of these criminal\nactivities, and the many places that illegally obtained property may be\nlocated, it is the purpose of this Act to create a limited, multicounty\nStatewide Grand Jury with authority to investigate, indict, and prosecute:\nnarcotic activity, including cannabis and controlled substance trafficking,\nnarcotics racketeering, money laundering, violations of the Cannabis\nand\nControlled Substances Tax Act, and violations of Article 29D of the Criminal\nCode of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012; the unlawful sale and transfer of firearms;\ngunrunning; and streetgang related felonies.",
