      "text": "The General Assembly finds that the\ndomestic relations area of law frequently involves individuals who are indigent\nand unable to obtain legal representation; the courts of Illinois are\nbacklogged\nwith both pre-judgment and post-judgment domestic relations cases involving\ndissolution of marriage, legal separation, declaration of invalidity of\nmarriage, visitation, custody, child support, paternity, and maintenance issues\nthat\nrequire\nnumerous court appearances and lengthy hearings caused in part by individuals\nwho are not represented by legal counsel and who do not understand the\nproceedings; the resolution of these cases where one or both parties have not\nbeen represented by counsel results in the unrepresented party not following\nthe court procedures and orders, many times causing multiple court proceedings,\nleading to costly and time consuming judicial\nproceedings revolving around the same issues; providing legal representation to\nthe indigent party in domestic\nrelations cases has a great potential for efficiently reducing the volume of\nmatters which burden the court system in this State; there are social and\neconomic benefits in reducing the number of court proceedings in domestic\nrelations cases; many seemingly minor disputes between individuals may escalate\ninto major social and legal problems without the intervention of legal\nrepresentation and education about the legal system for all parties; there are\ncompelling reasons for providing legal representation to indigent individuals\nin domestic relations matters; and not-for-profit charitable organizations have\nin the past and can continue to make a substantial contribution to the\nexpeditious operation and maintenance of the courts in domestic relations cases\npending in this State.",
