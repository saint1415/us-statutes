The\nGeneral Assembly further finds\nthat the availability of conservation and recreational programs for veterans, youth, and young adults in parks and\nrecreational facilities and other lands operated\nby the State, by units of local government, and by local\nnot-for-profit entities is severely limited. The\nGeneral Assembly therefore creates the Illinois Veteran, Youth, and Young Adult Conservation Jobs Act\nto establish (a) the Illinois Veteran Conservation Corps and the Illinois Young Adult Conservation Corps to\nprovide year-round employment\nfor veterans and young adults of this State for the purpose\nof conservation, rehabilitation, protection and enhancement of the State's public land\nand (b) the Illinois Veteran Recreation Corps and the Illinois Youth Recreation Corps to provide employment for the veterans and youth of this State for the purpose of\nadministering and operating conservation or recreational programs operated by units of local government or local not-for-profit entities at conservation and open spaces, parks, or\nrecreational facilities or other similar facilities or locations.",
