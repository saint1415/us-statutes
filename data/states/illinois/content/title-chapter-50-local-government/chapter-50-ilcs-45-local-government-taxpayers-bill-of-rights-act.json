Taxpayers must be notified in\nwriting by the local jurisdiction of a proposed audit of the taxpayer's books and\nrecords clearly identifying who will be conducting the audit. For audits being conducted by third-party providers, the local jurisdiction must provide written authorization for the third-party provider to review the books and records of the taxpayer. No contact may be made by the third-party provider until the local-jurisdiction authorization is received by the taxpayer. The notice of audit must specify the tax and time\nperiod to be audited and must detail the minimum\ndocumentation or books and records to be made available to\nthe auditor. Audits must be held only during reasonable\ntimes of the day and, unless impracticable, at times agreed\nto by the taxpayer. The auditor must sign a confidentiality agreement upon request by the taxpayer. Upon the completion of the audit, the local jurisdiction must issue an audit closure report to the taxpayer with the results of the audit. An auditor who determines that there has\nbeen an overpayment of tax during the course of the audit is\nobligated to identify the overpayment to the taxpayer so that\nthe taxpayer can take the necessary steps to recover the\noverpayment. If the overpayment is the result of the application\nof some or all of the taxpayer's tax payment to an incorrect\nlocal government entity, then upon request by a unit of local government, the audit information must be given to any unit of local government that may be affected by an overpayment.",
