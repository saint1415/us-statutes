      "text": "The Director is authorized to acquire by private purchase, acceptance, or by condemnation in the manner provided for the exercise of the power of eminent domain under the Eminent Domain Act, any and all lands, buildings and grounds where radioactive by-products and wastes produced by industrial, medical, agricultural, scientific or other organizations can be concentrated, stored or otherwise disposed in a manner consistent with the public health and safety. Whenever, in the judgment of the Director, it is necessary to relocate existing facilities for the construction, operation, closure or long-term care of a facility for the safe and secure disposal of low-level radioactive waste, the cost of relocating such existing facilities may be deemed a part of the disposal facility land acquisition and the Agency may, on behalf of the State, pay such costs. Existing facilities include public utilities, commercial or industrial facilities, residential buildings, and such other public or privately owned buildings as the Director deems necessary for relocation. The Agency is authorized to operate a relocation program, and to pay such costs of relocation as are provided in the federal \"Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act\", Public Law 91-646. The Director is authorized to exceed the maximum payments provided pursuant to the federal \"Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act\" if necessary to assure the provision of decent, safe, and sanitary housing, or to secure a suitable alternate location. Payments issued under this Section shall be made from the Low-level Radioactive Waste Facility Development and Operation Fund established by the Illinois Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Act.",

In all instances lands, buildings and grounds which are to be designated as sites for the concentration and storage of radioactive waste materials shall be acquired in fee simple absolute and dedicated in perpetuity to such purpose. All rights, title and interest in, of and to any radioactive waste materials accepted by the Agency for permanent storage at such facilities, shall upon acceptance become the property of the State and shall be in all respects administered, controlled, and disposed of, including transfer by sale, lease, loan or otherwise, by the Agency in the name of the State. All fees received pursuant to contracts entered into by the Agency shall be deposited in the State Treasury and shall be set apart in a special fund to be known as the \"Radioactive Waste Site Perpetual Care Fund\". Monies deposited in the fund shall be expended by the Agency to monitor and maintain the site as required to protect the public health and safety on a continuing and perpetual basis. All payments received by the Department of Nuclear Safety (now the Agency) pursuant to the settlement agreement entered May 25, 1988, in the matter of the People of the State of Illinois, et al. v. Teledyne, Inc., et al. (No. 78 MR 25, Circuit Court, Bureau County, Illinois) shall be held by the State Treasurer separate and apart from all public moneys or funds of the State, and shall be used only as provided in such settlement agreement.",
