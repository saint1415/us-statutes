Such\nbond shall be signed by the operator as principal, and by a good and\nsufficient corporate surety, licensed to do business in Illinois, as\nsurety. The penalty of such bond shall be an amount between $600 and $10,000\nper acre as determined by the Director for lands to be affected by\nsurface mining, including slurry and gob disposal areas. Under circumstances where a written agreement between the operator and a third party requires overburden to be removed, replaced, graded, and seeded in a manner that the necessary bond penalty exceeds $10,000 per acre, the Department shall require a bond amount sufficient to ensure the completion of the reclamation plan specified in the approved permit in the event of forfeiture. In no case shall the bond for the entire area under one permit be less than $600 per acre or $3,000, whichever is greater. Areas used for\nthe disposal of slurry and gob shall continue under bond so long as they\nare in active use. In lieu of such bonds, the operator may deposit any\ncombination of cash, certificates of deposits, government securities, or\nirrevocable letters of credit\nwith the Department in an amount equal to that of the required surety\nbond on conditions as prescribed in this Section. The penalty of the bond or amount of other security\nshall be increased or reduced from time to time as provided in this Act.\nSuch bond or security shall remain in effect until the affected lands have\nbeen reclaimed, approved, and released by the Department except that when\nthe Department determines that grading and covering with materials capable\nof supporting vegetation in accordance with the plan has been\nsatisfactorily completed, the Department shall release the bond or security\nexcept the amount of $100 per acre which shall be retained by the\nDepartment until the reclamation according to Section 6 of this Act has\nbeen completed. Where an anticipated water impoundment has been approved by\nthe Department in the reclamation plan, and the Department determines the\nimpoundment will be satisfactorily completed upon completion of the\noperation, the bond covering such anticipated water impoundment area shall\nbe released.",
