A disclosing State department and the requesting certified local health department shall enter into a data use agreement to ensure appropriate, effective, and efficient use of data obtained under this Act by the certified local health department, though no data use agreement shall, in a manner inconsistent with the purpose or requirements of this Act, impede certified local health department access to any public health data available to the Department of Public Health, the Department of Human Services, or the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, nor shall it require indemnification as a prerequisite to access. Each disclosing State department or agency shall execute a single master data use agreement that includes all data sets and is in accordance with the applicable laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to the specific data being requested. Master data use agreements shall include, at a minimum, data content, format, method of transfer, analytic and statistical methods, scope of use, and requirements for safeguarding the data under State and federal law. Pursuant to 77 Ill. Adm. Code 600.300, the executive officer of each certified local health department shall execute all master data use agreements. The State department or agency may require the names of any authorized users who will access or use the data provided. Each certified local health department shall be required to enter into applicable master data use agreements with each disclosing State department or agency to obtain requested data. Certified local health departments shall not be required to enter into any master data use agreement unless they are requesting subject data. Furthermore, all State departments or agencies shall enter into interdepartmental agreements with other State departments or agencies to share applicable data with eligible certified local health departments if necessary. Any data shared between State departments and agencies that is requested by a certified local health department shall be reviewed and approved by the State department or agency providing the data to ensure that all disclosures are made in accordance with procedures set forth in the data use agreements.",
