The closure of small rural\nhospitals, the inability of these areas to attract new physicians, the\nelimination of existing physician services because of increasing practice\ncosts, including the cost of providing malpractice insurance, and the lack\nof systems of emergency medical care contribute to the access problems\nexperienced by these residents.
