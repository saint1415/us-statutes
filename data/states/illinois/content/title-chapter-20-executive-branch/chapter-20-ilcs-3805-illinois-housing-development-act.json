This shortage is inimical to the\nsafety, health, morals and welfare of the residents of this State and the\nsound growth of its communities. Private enterprise and investment, without\nthe assistance contemplated in this Act, is not disposed to nor can it\neconomically achieve the needed construction of decent, safe and sanitary\nhousing at rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income\ncan afford, nor is it disposed nor can it so achieve the urgently needed\nrehabilitation of existing housing or the provision of existing housing\nto those persons and families at those rentals. It is, therefore,\nimperative that the cost of mortgage financing, a major factor materially\naffecting rental levels in housing built by private enterprise, be made\nlower in order to reduce rental levels for low and moderate income persons\nand families; that the supply of housing for persons and families displaced\nby public action or natural disaster be increased; and that private\nenterprise be encouraged to acquire, build and rehabilitate housing which\nwill help prevent the recurrence of slum conditions and assist in their\npermanent elimination by housing persons of varied economic means in the\nsame structures and neighborhoods.",
