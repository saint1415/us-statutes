The General\nAssembly further recognizes that persons with\ndisabilities who receive the services and support, directly or indirectly,\nare often not consulted for their perspectives, nor are their viewpoints\nsought regarding the\nefficiency, strengths, or weaknesses of the services and support. Various\nagencies in State government also promulgate standards that govern the\nadministration or operation of the services and support. Seldom are\npersons with disabilities or their families involved in the development of\nstandards that directly affect the quality of the services and support that\nthey receive. In addition, there are legislative commissions that serve in\nan advisory capacity concerning the services provided to persons with\ndisabilities and their families, whose membership does not include persons\nwith disabilities and their families.",
