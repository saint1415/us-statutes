Numerous incidents in\nIllinois have resulted in the desecration of human remains and vandalism to\ngraves and grave markers. Similar incidents have occurred in neighboring states and\nas a result those states have increased their criminal penalties for such\nconduct. Strong and meaningful relationships between the State of Illinois and tribal nations geographically and culturally affiliated to the land now known as the State of Illinois must be cultivated. There\nis an immediate need for legislation to protect the graves of Native Americans and any other peoples geographically and culturally affiliated to the land now known as the State of Illinois from such desecration. The General Assembly intends to assure\nwith this Act that all human burials be accorded equal treatment and\nrespect for human dignity.",
