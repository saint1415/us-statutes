      "text": "that in many parts of this State, large numbers of citizens are faced with the\ninability to secure affordable rental housing. Due to either insufficient wages\nor a shortage of affordable rental housing stock, or both, many families have\ndifficulty securing decent housing, are subjected to overcrowding, pay too\nlarge a portion of their total monthly income for housing and consequently\nsuffer the lack of other\nbasic needs, live in substandard or unhealthy housing, or experience chronic\nhousing instability. Instability and inadequacy in housing limits the\nemployability and productivity of many citizens, adversely affects family\nhealth and stress levels, and impedes children's ability to learn; such instability produces\ncorresponding drains on public resources and contributes to an overall decline in real estate values. Unaffordable rental\nrates lead to frequent tenant turnover and difficulty filling vacancies, resulting in unstable\nincome streams for rental property owners, the limited ability of owners to properly maintain\ntheir properties, substandard rental housing, and greater rates of foreclosure. High tenant\nturnover, poorly maintained properties, vacant and abandoned properties, and overcrowded\nhousing negatively impact the safety and health of communities and the real estate values within\nsuch communities. Among others, the program created by this Act benefits (i) all individuals\nwho record real estate related documents by helping to stabilize real estate values in the State,\n(ii) rental property owners by subsidizing the portion of rent that many of their tenants are unable to pay, (iii) those individuals who own real estate in the State by providing an option for\naffordable rental housing should they one day face foreclosure, and (iv) tenants who participate\nin the program by providing them with rental assistance and the ability to achieve financial\nstability so that they are able to become property owners themselves. It is the purpose of this Act to\ncreate a State program to help localities address the need for decent,\naffordable, permanent rental housing.",
