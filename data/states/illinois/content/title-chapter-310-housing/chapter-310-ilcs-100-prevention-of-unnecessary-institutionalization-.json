The General Assembly further finds that older persons and adults\nand children with disabilities often are unnecessarily placed or forced to\nremain in institutionalized settings due to the lack of resources needed to\nmake modifications to their dwellings or to obtain assistive technology devices\nto enable them to remain in or return to their homes and communities. The\nGeneral Assembly further finds that it is in the best interests of the State of\nIllinois to support community-based living for older persons and adults and\nchildren with disabilities by implementing a program to enable them to make\nmodifications to their dwellings or to obtain assistive technology devices to\navoid unnecessary placement outside of their own homes and communities.",
