Blessed with rich agricultural soils and a favorable\nagricultural\nclimate, Illinois traditionally ranks fourth or fifth among the States in the\nnation's gross agricultural production. The food and agricultural sector,\nemploying nearly 20% of the State's workers, is committed to providing safe,\nnutritious, high-quality, affordable, and convenient agricultural products and\nservices to Illinois citizens. Compared with all other states, however,\nIllinois faces a tremendous challenge to meet its needs for ongoing adequate\nresearch investments that improve human health while protecting and enhancing\nits natural resources and environment. Without adequate State funding, the\nfood and agricultural sector faces the consequences of falling behind in\ninformation, projects, and programs affecting human lives and the demand for\nimproved nutrition, food quality, human health, and environment.",
