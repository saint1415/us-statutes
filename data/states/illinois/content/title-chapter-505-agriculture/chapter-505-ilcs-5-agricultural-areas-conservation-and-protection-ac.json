It is also the policy of this State to conserve and protect agricultural\nlands as valued natural and ecological resources which provide needed open\nspaces for clean air sheds as well as for aesthetic purposes. Agriculture\nin many parts of the State is under urban pressure from expanding metropolitan\nareas. This urban pressure takes the form of scattered development in wide\nbelts around urban areas, brings conflicting land uses into juxtaposition,\ncreates high costs for public services, and stimulates land speculation.\nWhen this scattered development extends into productive farm areas, ordinances\ninhibiting farming tend to follow, farm taxes rise, and hopes for speculative\ngains discourage investments in farm improvements. Much agricultural land\nin Illinois is in jeopardy of being lost for any agricultural purpose. Certain\nof these lands constitute unique and irreplaceable land resources of Statewide\nimportance. It is the purpose of this Act to\nprovide a means by which agricultural land may be protected and enhanced\nas a viable segment of the State's economy and as an economic and environmental\nresource of major importance.",
