      "text": "recognizes that hunger and food security are serious problems in the State of\nIllinois with as\nmany as one million citizens being affected. These citizens have lost\ntheir sense of food security.\nFood insecurity occurs whenever the availability of nutritionally adequate\nand safe foods or the ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially\nacceptable ways is limited or uncertain. Hunger is a painful or uneasy\nsensation caused by a recurrent or involuntary lack of food and is a\npotential, although not necessary, consequence of food insecurity. Over\ntime, hunger may result in malnutrition.\nIt is estimated that just under 600,000 Illinois\nchildren\nexperience hunger or food insecurity, meaning that they either go without\neating meals,\nor their parents or guardians cannot provide the kinds of food they need.\nAt present, the Illinois economy is steadily experiencing a 6%\nunemployment rate, people are being laid off who thought they had job\nsecurity, and the unemployed are remaining unemployed beyond the\nterms of unemployment benefits. Emergency food providers throughout\nthe State are experiencing an increase in the number of working poor\nfamilies requesting emergency food. In October 2003, Illinois was\nranked 48th in the nation in providing school breakfasts to low-income\nchildren of families who meet the criteria for free and reduced-price\nlunches.\nBecause\nlow-income children are not being\nadequately nourished, even to the point where many are arriving at school\nhungry, the General Assembly believes it is in the best interest of\nIllinois to utilize resources available through existing child nutrition\nprograms, to the fullest extent possible.",
