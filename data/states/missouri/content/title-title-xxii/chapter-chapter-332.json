Such terms shall only be used in the announcement or advertisement of sedation services with the possession of a deep sedation, general anesthesia, or moderate sedation permit or license;\n\n(15) Violation of the drug laws or rules and regulations of this state, any other state or the federal government;\n\n(16) Failure or refusal to properly guard against contagious, infectious or communicable diseases or the spread thereof;\n\n(17) Failing to maintain his or her office or offices, laboratory, equipment and instruments in a safe and sanitary condition;\n\n(18) Accepting, tendering or paying rebates to or splitting fees with any other person; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be so construed as to make it unlawful for a dentist practicing in a partnership or as a corporation organized pursuant to the provisions of chapter 356 to distribute profits in accordance with his or her stated agreement;\n\n(19) Administering, or causing or permitting to be administered, nitrous oxide gas in any amount to himself or herself, or to another unless as an adjunctive measure to patient management;\n\n(20) Being unable to practice as a dentist, specialist or hygienist with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reasons of professional incompetency, or because of illness, drunkenness, excessive use of drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or as a result of any mental or physical condition. In enforcing this subdivision the board shall, after a hearing before the board, upon a finding of probable cause, require the dentist or specialist or hygienist to submit to a reexamination for the purpose of establishing his or her competency to practice as a dentist, specialist or hygienist, which reexamination shall be conducted in accordance with rules adopted for this purpose by the board, including rules to allow the examination of the dentist's, specialist's or hygienist's professional competence by at least three dentists or fellow specialists, or to submit to a mental or physical examination or combination thereof by at least three physicians. One examiner shall be selected by the dentist, specialist or hygienist compelled to take examination, one selected by the board, and one shall be selected by the two examiners so selected. Notice of the physical or mental examination shall be given by personal service or registered mail. Failure of the dentist, specialist or hygienist to submit to the examination when directed shall constitute an admission of the allegations against him or her, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond his or her control. A dentist, specialist or hygienist whose right to practice has been affected pursuant to this subdivision shall, at reasonable intervals, be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that he or she can resume competent practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients.\n\n(a) In any proceeding pursuant to this subdivision, neither the record of proceedings nor the orders entered by the board shall be used against a dentist, specialist or hygienist in any other proceeding. Proceedings pursuant to this subdivision shall be conducted by the board without the filing of a complaint with the administrative hearing commission;\n\n(b) When the board finds any person unqualified because of any of the grounds set forth in this subdivision, it may enter an order imposing one or more of the following: denying his or her application for a license; permanently withholding issuance of a license; administering a public or private reprimand; placing on probation, suspending or limiting or restricting his or her license to practice as a dentist, specialist or hygienist for a period of not more than five years; revoking his or her license to practice as a dentist, specialist or hygienist; requiring him or her to submit to the care, counseling or treatment of physicians designated by the dentist, specialist or hygienist compelled to be treated; or requiring such person to submit to identification, intervention, treatment or rehabilitation by the well-being committee as provided in section 332.327. For the purpose of this subdivision,\"license\"includes the certificate of registration, or license, or both, issued by the board.\n\n3. After the filing of such complaint, the proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 621. Upon a finding by the administrative hearing commission that the grounds, provided in subsection 2, for disciplinary action are met, the board may, singly or in combination:\n\n(1) Censure or place the person or firm named in the complaint on probation on such terms and conditions as the board deems appropriate for a period not to exceed five years; or\n\n(2) Suspend the license, certificate or permit for a period not to exceed three years; or\n\n(3) Revoke the license, certificate, or permit. In any order of revocation, the board may provide that the person shall not apply for licensure for a period of not less than one year following the date of the order of revocation; or\n\n(4) Cause the person or firm named in the complaint to make restitution to any patient, or any insurer or third-party payer who shall have paid in whole or in part a claim or payment for which they should be reimbursed, where restitution would be an appropriate remedy, including the reasonable cost of follow-up care to correct or complete a procedure performed or one that was to be performed by the person or firm named in the complaint; or\n\n(5) Request the attorney general to bring an action in the circuit court of competent jurisdiction to recover a civil penalty on behalf of the state in an amount to be assessed by the court.\n\n4. If the board concludes that a dentist or dental hygienist has committed an act or is engaging in a course of conduct that would be grounds for disciplinary action and constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health and safety, the board may file a complaint before the administrative hearing commission requesting an expedited hearing and specifying the conduct that gives rise to the danger and the nature of the proposed restriction or suspension of the dentist's or dental hygienist's license. Within fifteen days after service of the complaint on the dentist or dental hygienist, the administrative hearing commission shall conduct a preliminary hearing to determine whether the alleged conduct of the dentist or dental hygienist appears to constitute a clear and present danger to the public health and safety that justifies that the dentist's or dental hygienist's license be immediately restricted or suspended. The burden of proving that a dentist or dental hygienist is a clear and present danger to the public health and safety shall be upon the Missouri dental board. The administrative hearing commission shall issue its decision immediately after the hearing and shall either grant to the board the authority to suspend or restrict the license or dismiss the action.\n\n5. If the administrative hearing commission grants temporary authority to the board to restrict or suspend a dentist's or dental hygienist's license, the dentist or dental hygienist named in the complaint may request a full hearing before the administrative hearing commission. A request for a full hearing shall be made within thirty days after the administrative hearing commission issues a decision. The administrative hearing commission shall, if requested by a dentist or dental hygienist named in the complaint, set a date to hold a full hearing under chapter 621 regarding the activities alleged in the initial complaint filed by the board. The administrative hearing commission shall set the date for full hearing within ninety days from the date its decision was issued. Either party may request continuances, which shall be granted by the administrative hearing commission upon a showing of good cause by either party or consent of both parties. If a request for a full hearing is not made within thirty days, the authority to impose discipline becomes final and the board shall set the matter for hearing in accordance with section 621.110.\n\n6. If the administrative hearing commission dismisses without prejudice the complaint filed by the board under subsection 4 of this section or dismisses the action based on a finding that the board did not meet its burden of proof establishing a clear and present danger, such dismissal shall not bar the board from initiating a subsequent action on the same grounds in accordance with this chapter and chapters 536 and 621.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of section 332.071 or of this section, a currently licensed dentist in Missouri may enter into an agreement with individuals and organizations to provide dental health care, provided such agreement does not permit or compel practices that violate any provision of this chapter.\n\n8.
