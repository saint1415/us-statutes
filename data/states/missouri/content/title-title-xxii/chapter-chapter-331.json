The application shall contain a statement that it is made under oath or affirmation and that representations contained thereon are true and correct to the best knowledge and belief of the person signing the application, subject to the penalties of making a false affidavit or declaration, and shall give the applicant's name, address, age, sex, name of chiropractic schools or colleges which the person attended or of which the person is a graduate, and such other reasonable information as the board may require. The applicant shall give evidence satisfactory to the board of the successful completion of the educational requirements of this chapter, and that the chiropractic school or college of which the applicant is a graduate is teaching chiropractic in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The board may make a final determination as to whether or not the school from which the applicant graduated is so teaching.\n\n3. Before an applicant shall be eligible for licensure, the applicant shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant has received the minimum number of semester credit hours, as required by the Council on Chiropractic Education, or its successor, prior to beginning the doctoral course of study in chiropractic. The minimum number of semester credit hours applicable at the time of enrollment in a doctoral course of study must be in those subjects, hours and course content as may be provided for by the Council on Chiropractic Education or, in the absence of the Council on Chiropractic Education or its provision for such subjects, such hours and course content as adopted by rule of the board; however in no event shall fewer than ninety semester credit hours be accepted as the minimum number of hours required prior to beginning the doctoral course of study in chiropractic. The examination applicant shall also provide evidence satisfactory to the board of having graduated from a chiropractic college having status with the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education or its successor.

The board shall issue to each applicant who meets the standards and successful completion of the examinations, as established by rule of the board, a license to practice chiropractic. The board shall not recognize any correspondence work in any chiropractic school or college as credit for meeting the requirements of this chapter.\n\n6. The board shall issue a license without examination to persons who have been regularly licensed to practice chiropractic in any foreign country, provided that the regulations for securing a license in the other country are equivalent to those required for licensure in the state of Missouri, when the applicant furnishes satisfactory evidence that the applicant has continuously practiced chiropractic for at least one year immediately preceding the applicant's application to the board, and upon the payment of the reciprocity license fee as established by rule of the board.
