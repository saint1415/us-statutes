Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a doctor of podiatric medicine from performing ankle surgery under the direct supervision of a doctor who is authorized to perform surgery of the ankle. Surgical treatment of the ankle by a doctor of podiatric medicine shall be performed only in a licensed acute care hospital or a licensed ambulatory surgical clinic. A doctor of podiatric medicine performing ankle surgery shall be required to complete the biennial continuing medical education hourly credit requirements as established by the state board of podiatric medicine.
