Furthermore, that psychologist's temporary authorization to practice is terminated and the IPC is revoked.\n\n(2) All home state disciplinary orders which impose adverse action shall be reported to the commission in accordance with the rules promulgated by the commission. A compact state shall report adverse actions in accordance with the rules of the commission.\n\n(3) In the event discipline is reported on a psychologist, the psychologist will not be eligible for telepsychology or temporary in-person, face-to-face practice in accordance with the rules of the commission.\n\n(4) Other actions may be imposed as determined by the rules promulgated by the commission.\n\n4. A home state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee which occurred in a receiving state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In such cases, the home state's law shall control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.\n\n5. A distant state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under temporary authorization practice which occurred in that distant state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In such cases, distant state's law shall control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's temporary authorization to practice.\n\n6. Nothing in this compact shall override a compact state's decision that a psychologist's participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the compact state's law. Compact states shall require psychologists who enter any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services under the temporary authorization to practice in any other compact state during the term of the alternative program.\n\n7. No other judicial or administrative remedies shall be available to a psychologist in the event a compact state imposes an adverse action pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.\n\n(L. 2018 H.B. 1719 merged with S.B. 660)\n\nEffective 12-22-20, see § 337.170",

This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:\n\n(1) Increase public access to Social Work Services;\n\n(2) Reduce overly burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with holding multiple licenses;\n\n(3) Enhance the Member States' ability to protect the public's health and safety;\n\n(4) Encourage the cooperation of Member States in regulating multistate practice;\n\n(5) Promote mobility and address workforce shortages by eliminating the necessity for licenses in multiple States by providing for the mutual recognition of other Member State licenses;\n\n(6) Support military families;\n\n(7) Facilitate the exchange of licensure and disciplinary information among Member States;\n\n(8) Authorize all Member States to hold a Regulated Social Worker accountable for abiding by a Member State's laws, regulations, and applicable professional standards in the Member State in which the client is located at the time care is rendered; and\n\n(9) Allow for the use of telehealth to facilitate increased access to regulated Social Work Services.\n\n(L. 2023 S.B. 70 merged with S.B. 157)",

The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State's laws, regulations, and applicable standards that govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.\n\n3. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.\n\n4. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member State.\n\n5. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.\n\n6. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.\n\n7.

All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.\n\n10. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.\n\n11. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.\n\n(1) The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule.\n\n(2) The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.\n\n(3) The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.\n\n12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n(1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n(2) Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;\n\n(3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is established by federal law or rule; or\n\n(4) Protect public health and safety.\n\n13. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\n14.
