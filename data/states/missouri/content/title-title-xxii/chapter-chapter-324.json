Division of professional registration established, duties — boards and commissions assigned to — reference to division in statutes — workforce data analysis, requirements. —1. For the purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Department\", the department of commerce and insurance;\n\n(2)\"Director\", the director of the division of professional registration; and\n\n(3)\"Division\", the division of professional registration.\n\n2. There is hereby established a \"Division of Professional Registration\" assigned to the department of commerce and insurance as a type III transfer, headed by a director appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. All of the general provisions, definitions and powers enumerated in section 1 of the Omnibus State Reorganization Act of 1974 and Executive Order 06-04 shall apply to this department and its divisions, agencies, and personnel.\n\n3. The director of the division of professional registration shall promulgate rules and regulations which designate for each board or commission assigned to the division the renewal date for licenses or certificates. After the initial establishment of renewal dates, no director of the division shall promulgate a rule or regulation which would change the renewal date for licenses or certificates if such change in renewal date would occur prior to the date on which the renewal date in effect at the time such new renewal date is specified next occurs. Each board or commission shall by rule or regulation establish licensing periods of one, two, or three years. Registration fees set by a board or commission shall be effective for the entire licensing period involved, and shall not be increased during any current licensing period. Persons who are required to pay their first registration fees shall be allowed to pay the pro rata share of such fees for the remainder of the period remaining at the time the fees are paid. Each board or commission shall provide the necessary forms for initial registration, and thereafter the director may prescribe standard forms for renewal of licenses and certificates. Each board or commission shall by rule and regulation require each applicant to provide the information which is required to keep the board's records current. Each board or commission shall have the authority to collect and analyze information required to support workforce planning and policy development. Such information shall not be publicly disclosed so as to identify a specific health care provider, as defined in section 376.1350. Each board or commission shall issue the original license or certificate.\n\n4. The division shall provide clerical and other staff services relating to the issuance and renewal of licenses for all the professional licensing and regulating boards and commissions assigned to the division. The division shall perform the financial management and clerical functions as they each relate to issuance and renewal of licenses and certificates.\"Issuance and renewal of licenses and certificates\"means the ministerial function of preparing and delivering licenses or certificates, and obtaining material and information for the board or commission in connection with the renewal thereof to include verifying if the applicant has submitted all required documentation and that the documentation is legible. It does not include any discretionary authority with regard to the original review of an applicant's qualifications for licensure or certification, or the subsequent review of licensee's or certificate holder's qualifications, or any disciplinary action contemplated against the licensee or certificate holder. The division may develop and implement microfilming systems and automated or manual management information systems.\n\n5. The director of the division shall maintain a system of accounting and budgeting, in cooperation with the director of the department, the office of administration, and the state auditor's office, to ensure proper charges are made to the various boards for services rendered to them. The general assembly shall appropriate to the division and other state agencies from each board's funds moneys sufficient to reimburse the division and other state agencies for all services rendered and all facilities and supplies furnished to that board.\n\n6. For accounting purposes, the appropriation to the division and to the office of administration for the payment of rent for quarters provided for the division shall be made from the \"Professional Registration Fees Fund\", which is hereby created, and is to be used solely for the purpose defined in subsection 5 of this section. The fund shall consist of moneys deposited into it from each board's fund. Each board shall contribute a prorated amount necessary to fund the division for services rendered and rent based upon the system of accounting and budgeting established by the director of the division as provided in subsection 5 of this section. Transfers of funds to the professional registration fees fund shall be made by each board on July first of each year; provided, however, that the director of the division may establish an alternative date or dates of transfers at the request of any board. Such transfers shall be made until they equal the prorated amount for services rendered and rent by the division. The provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, money in this fund shall not be transferred and placed to the credit of general revenue.\n\n7. The director of the division shall be responsible for collecting and accounting for all moneys received by the division or its component agencies. Any money received by a board or commission shall be promptly given, identified by type and source, to the director. The director shall keep a record by board and state accounting system classification of the amount of revenue the director receives. The director shall promptly transmit all receipts to the department of revenue for deposit in the state treasury to the credit of the appropriate fund. The director shall provide each board with all relevant financial information in a timely fashion. Each board shall cooperate with the director by providing necessary information.\n\n8. All educational transcripts, test scores, complaints, investigatory reports, and information pertaining to any person who is an applicant or licensee of any agency assigned to the division of professional registration by statute or by the department are confidential and may not be disclosed to the public or any member of the public, except with the written consent of the person whose records are involved. The agency which possesses the records or information shall disclose the records or information if the person whose records or information is involved has consented to the disclosure. Each agency is entitled to the attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege to the same extent as any other person. Provided, however, that any board may disclose confidential information without the consent of the person involved in the course of voluntary interstate exchange of information, or in the course of any litigation concerning that person, or pursuant to a lawful request, or to other administrative or law enforcement agencies acting within the scope of their statutory authority. Information regarding identity, including names and addresses, registration, and currency of the license of the persons possessing licenses to engage in a professional occupation and the names and addresses of applicants for such licenses is not confidential information.\n\n9. Any deliberations conducted and votes taken in rendering a final decision after a hearing before an agency assigned to the division shall be closed to the parties and the public. Once a final decision is rendered, that decision shall be made available to the parties and the public.\n\n10. A compelling governmental interest shall be deemed to exist for the purposes of section 536.025 for licensure fees to be reduced by emergency rule, if the projected fund balance of any agency assigned to the division of professional registration is reasonably expected to exceed an amount that would require transfer from that fund to general revenue.\n\n11.

Nothing herein shall prohibit employment of professional examining or testing services from professional associations or others as required by the boards or commissions on contract. Nothing herein shall be construed to affect the power of a board or commission to expend its funds as appropriated. However, the division shall review the expense vouchers of each board. The results of such review shall be submitted to the board reviewed and to the house and senate appropriations committees annually.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the director of the division shall exercise only those management functions of the boards and commissions specifically provided in the Reorganization Act of 1974, and those relating to the allocation and assignment of space, personnel other than board personnel, and equipment.\n\n(4)\"Board personnel\", as used in this section or chapters 317, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, and 345, shall mean personnel whose functions and responsibilities are in areas not related to the clerical duties involving the issuance and renewal of licenses, to the collecting and accounting for moneys, or to financial management relating to issuance and renewal of licenses; specifically included are executive secretaries (or comparable positions), consultants, inspectors, investigators, counsel, and secretarial support staff for these positions; and such other positions as are established and authorized by statute for a particular board or commission. Boards and commissions may employ legal counsel, if authorized by law, and temporary personnel if the board is unable to meet its responsibilities with the employees authorized above. Any board or commission which hires temporary employees shall annually provide the division director and the appropriation committees of the general assembly with a complete list of all persons employed in the previous year, the length of their employment, the amount of their remuneration, and a description of their responsibilities.\n\n(5) Board personnel for each board or commission shall be employed by and serve at the pleasure of the board or commission, shall be supervised as the board or commission designates, and shall have their duties and compensation prescribed by the board or commission, within appropriations for that purpose, except that compensation for board personnel shall not exceed that established for comparable positions as determined by the board or commission pursuant to the job and pay plan of the department of commerce and insurance. Nothing herein shall be construed to permit salaries for any board personnel to be lowered except by board action.\n\n12. All the powers, duties, and functions of the division of athletics, chapter 317, and others, are assigned by type I transfer to the division of professional registration.\n\n13. Wherever the laws, rules, or regulations of this state make reference to the division of professional registration of the department of economic development, such references shall be deemed to refer to the division of professional registration.\n\n14. (1) The state board of nursing, board of pharmacy, Missouri dental board, state committee of psychologists, state board of chiropractic examiners, state board of optometry, Missouri board of occupational therapy, or state board of registration for the healing arts may individually or collectively enter into a contractual agreement with the department of health and senior services, a public institution of higher education, or a nonprofit entity for the purpose of collecting and analyzing workforce data from its licensees, registrants, or permit holders for future workforce planning and to assess the accessibility and availability of qualified health care services and practitioners in Missouri. The boards shall work collaboratively with other state governmental entities to ensure coordination and avoid duplication of efforts.\n\n(2) The boards may expend appropriated funds necessary for operational expenses of the program formed under this subsection. Each board is authorized to accept grants to fund the collection or analysis authorized in this subsection. Any such funds shall be deposited in the respective board's fund.\n\n(3) Data collection shall be controlled and approved by the applicable state board conducting or requesting the collection. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 324.010 and 334.001, the boards may release identifying data to the contractor to facilitate data analysis of the health care workforce including, but not limited to, geographic, demographic, and practice or professional characteristics of licensees. The state board shall not request or be authorized to collect income or other financial earnings data.\n\n(4) Data collected under this subsection shall be deemed the property of the state board requesting the data. Data shall be maintained by the state board in accordance with chapter 610, provided that any information deemed closed or confidential under subsection 8 of this section or any other provision of state law shall not be disclosed without consent of the applicable licensee or entity or as otherwise authorized by law. Data shall only be released in an aggregate form by geography, profession or professional specialization, or population characteristic in a manner that cannot be used to identify a specific individual or entity. Data suppression standards shall be addressed and established in the contractual agreement.\n\n(5) Contractors shall maintain the security and confidentiality of data received or collected under this subsection and shall not use, disclose, or release any data without approval of the applicable state board. The contractual agreement between the applicable state board and contractor shall establish a data release and research review policy to include legal and institutional review board, or agency-equivalent, approval.\n\n(6) Each board may promulgate rules subject to the provisions of this subsection and chapter 536 to effectuate and implement the workforce data collection and analysis authorized by this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2016, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2008 S.B. 788, A.L. 2009 S.B. 296, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1816 merged with S.B. 635, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1719)",

Registration may include a requirement to post a bond but does not include education or experience requirements. If the requirement of registration is not met, the individual is prohibited from performing the occupation for compensation or using \"registered\" as a designated title.

All individuals may engage in the occupation of their choice, free from unreasonable government regulation. The state shall not impose a substantial burden on an individual's pursuit of his or her occupation or profession unless there is a reasonable interest for the state to protect the general welfare. If such an interest exists, the regulation adopted by the state shall be the least restrictive type of occupational regulation consistent with the public interest to be protected.\n\n4. All bills introduced in the general assembly to regulate, pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, an occupation or profession shall be reviewed according to the following criteria. An occupation or profession shall be regulated by the state if:\n\n(1) Unregulated practice could cause harm and endanger the general welfare, and the potential for further harm and endangerment is recognizable;\n\n(2) The public can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of personal qualifications; and\n\n(3) The general welfare cannot be sufficiently protected by other means.\n\n5. After evaluating the criteria in subdivision (3) of this subsection and considering governmental, economic, and societal costs and benefits, if the general assembly finds that the state has a reasonable interest in regulating, pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, an occupation or profession not previously regulated by law, the most efficient form of regulation shall be implemented, consistent with this section and with the need to protect the general welfare, as follows:\n\n(1) If the threat to the general welfare resulting from the practitioner's services is easily predictable, the regulation shall implement a system of insurance, bonding, or registration;\n\n(2) If the consumer has challenges accessing credentialing information or possesses significantly less information on how to report abuses such that the practitioner puts the consumer in a disadvantageous position relative to the practitioner to judge the quality of the practitioner's services, the regulation shall implement a system of certification; and\n\n(3) If other regulatory structures, such as bonding, insurance, registration, and certification, insufficiently protect the general welfare from recognizable harm, the regulation shall implement a system of licensing.\n\n6.

DATA SYSTEM\n\nA. The Commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, and utilization of a coordinated database and reporting system containing licensure, Adverse Action, and Investigative Information on all licensed individuals in Member States.\n\nB. A Member State shall submit a uniform data set to the Data System on all individuals to whom this Compact is applicable (utilizing a unique identifier) as required by the Rules of the Commission, including:\n\n1.

RULEMAKING\n\nA. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.\n\nB. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.\n\nC. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within 4 years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member State.\n\nD. Rules or amendments to the Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.\n\nE. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or Rules by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:\n\n1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible platform; and\n\n2. On the website of each Member State Occupational Therapy Licensing Board or other publicly accessible platform or the publication in which each State would otherwise publish proposed Rules.\n\nF. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:\n\n1. The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the Rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n2. The text of the proposed Rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed Rule;\n\n3. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested person; and\n\n4. The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.\n\nG. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.\n\nH. The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a Rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:\n\n1. At least twenty five (25) persons;\n\n2. A State or federal governmental subdivision or agency; or\n\n3. An association or organization having at least twenty five (25) members.\n\nI. If a hearing is held on the proposed Rule or amendment, the Commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing. If the hearing is held via electronic means, the Commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.\n\n1. All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.\n\n2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.\n\n3. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording will be made available on request.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.\n\nJ. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nK. If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed Rule without a public hearing.\n\nL. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed Rule and shall determine the effective date of the Rule, if any, based on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.\n\nM. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;\n\n3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative Rule that is established by federal law or Rule; or\n\n4. Protect public health and safety.\n\nN. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.\n\nSECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nA. Oversight\n\n1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of State government in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the Rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.\n\n2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the Rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Member State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.\n\n3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.\n\nB. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination\n\n1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall:\n\na. Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Member States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and\n\nb. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and each of the Member States.\n\n4. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.\n\n6. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nC. Dispute Resolution\n\n1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between member and non-Member States.\n\n2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\nD. Enforcement\n\n1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.\n\n2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or State law.\n\nSECTION 12. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT\n\nA. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth Member State. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of Rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise Rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.\n\nB. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.\n\nC. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n\n1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\n2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Occupational Therapy Licensing Board to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\n\nD. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any Occupational Therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.\n\nE. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.\n\nSECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.\n\nSECTION 14. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nA. A Licensee providing Occupational Therapy in a Remote State under the Compact Privilege shall function within the laws and regulations of the Remote State.\n\nB. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.\n\nC. Any laws in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nD. Any lawful actions of the Commission, including all Rules and bylaws promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the Member States.\n\nE. All agreements between the Commission and the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nF. In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Member State, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that Member State.\n\n(L. 2021 H.B. 273 merged with H.B. 476)\n\n*Number \"63\" appears here in original rolls of H.B. 476, 2021.",
