The name of a firm shall not include the name or initials of an individual who is not a present or a past partner, member or shareholder of the firm or its predecessor. The name of the firm shall not include the name of an individual who is not a licensee.\n\n7.

The documents shall be furnished to the board only in a redacted manner that does not specifically identify any firm or licensee being peer reviewed or any of their clients.\n\n13. The peer review processes shall be operated and the documents generated thereby be maintained in a manner designed to preserve their confidentiality. No third party, other than the oversight body, the board, subject to the provisions of subsection 12 of this section, or the organization performing peer review shall have access to documents furnished or generated in the course of the review. All documents shall be privileged and closed records for all purposes and all meetings at which the documents are discussed shall be considered closed meetings under subdivision (1) of section 610.021. The proceedings, records and workpapers of the board and any peer review subjected to the board process shall be privileged and shall not be subject to discovery, subpoena or other means of legal process or introduction into evidence at any civil action, arbitration, administrative proceeding or board proceeding.
