The board shall hold a hearing following the certification of the record by the administrative hearing commission and may impose any discipline otherwise authorized by state law.\n\n12. Any action under this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any discipline otherwise in the board's power to impose and may be brought concurrently with other actions.\n\n13. If the administrative hearing commission does not find probable cause and does not grant the emergency suspension or restriction, the board shall remove all reference to such emergency suspension or restriction from its public records.

The administrative hearing commission shall, if requested by the nurse named in the complaint, set a date to hold a full hearing under the provisions of chapter 621 regarding the activities alleged in the initial complaint filed by the board.\n\n15. If the administrative hearing commission refuses to grant temporary authority to the board or restrict or suspend the nurse's license under subsection 8 of this section, such dismissal shall not bar the board from initiating a subsequent disciplinary action on the same grounds.\n\n16.

The state board of nursing may establish an intervention program and an alternative program to promote the identification, intervention, treatment, and monitoring of nurses or applicants for a nursing license who may be impaired by reason of substance abuse or the potential for substance abuse.\n\n2. The intervention program is available, upon board discretion, to licensees and applicants for licensure who self-refer, test positive in a pre-employment or for-cause drug or alcohol screen, individuals who have pled guilty to or been found guilty of any drug offense, whether felony or misdemeanor, or individuals who have pled guilty to or been found guilty of three or more criminal offenses resulting from or related to the use of drugs or alcohol, whether a felony or misdemeanor. The program shall be a minimum of one year in duration and require random drug and alcohol testing at the participant's expense.\n\n3. The alternative program is available, upon board discretion, to licensees and applicants for licensure who admit to having a substance use disorder.

If accepted, the board and individual may enter into a written agreement setting forth the requirements of the program. If declined, the board may proceed with its regular process of investigating a complaint or application as set forth in this chapter and chapter 324. The board shall retain sole discretion to offer the program at any time.\n\n5. Upon successful completion of the intervention or alternative program, the licensee shall be deemed to have no disciplinary action against his or her license and shall not be required to disclose participation in the program. All records shall be deemed confidential and not public records under chapter 610 and not subject to court or administration subpoena or subject to discovery or introduction as evidence in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings.\n\n6.

Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\n10. The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\n11. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing; provided that, the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately in order to:\n\n(1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n\n(2) Prevent a loss of commission or party state funds; or\n\n(3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.\n\n12. The commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision shall be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1816 merged with S.B. 608 merged with S.B. 635)\n\nEffective 7-20-17, see § 335.420.\n\n*S.B. 608 was vetoed July 5, 2016.

(1) If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\n(a) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\n(b) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n(2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact shall be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination.

(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n(2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
