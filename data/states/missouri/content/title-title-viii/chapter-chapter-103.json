As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Health savings account\"or\"account\", shall have the same meaning ascribed to it as in 26 U.S.C. Section 223(d), as amended;\n\n(2)\"High deductible health plan\", a policy or contract of health insurance or health care plan that meets the criteria established in 26 U.S.C. Section 223(c)(2), as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n2. Beginning with the open enrollment period for the 2009 plan year, the board shall offer to all qualified state employees and retirees, in addition to the plans currently offered including but not limited to health maintenance organization plans, preferred provider organization plans, copay plans, and participating public entities the option of receiving health care coverage through a high deductible health plan and the establishment of a health savings account. The health savings account shall conform to the guidelines to be established by the Internal Revenue Service for the current tax year but in no case shall a qualified employee or retiree be required to contribute more than the minimum amount allowed by law. A qualified employee or retiree may contribute up to the maximum allowed by law. In order for a qualified individual to obtain a high deductible health plan through the Missouri consolidated health care plan, such individual shall present evidence, in a manner prescribed by regulation, to the board that he or she has established a health savings account in compliance with 26 U.S.C. Section 223, and any amendments and regulations promulgated thereto.\n\n3. Beginning with the open enrollment period for the 2012 plan year, the high deductible health plan offered under subsection 2 of this section shall have monthly subscriber premiums that are materially lower than non-high deductible health plan monthly subscriber premiums with a goal of monthly subscriber premiums being at least fifty percent lower than non-high deductible health plan premiums. The amount of the annual deductible for the high deductible health plan offered under subsection 2 of this section shall be no greater than two hundred percent of the minimum annual deductible for self-only coverage and family coverage as established by the Internal Revenue Service for the current tax year. The coverage afforded by the high deductible health plan, after the applicable deductible has been met, shall be substantially similar or better than the average coverage provided by the non-high deductible health plans.\n\n4. It is the intent of the Missouri general assembly to promote the use of consumer-driven health care plans such as health savings account compatible high deductible health plans by active state employees as an alternative to using traditional managed care plans. If, after the completion of the open enrollment period for the 2012 plan year, fewer than ten percent of Missouri's active state employees have enrolled in a high deductible health plan described in this section, then the board shall offer a more competitive high deductible health plan with increased financial and coverage incentives, including but not limited to alternative annual deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, and other health plan design features, all within the established federal guidelines, with the goal of having forty percent of Missouri's active state employees enrolling in a health savings account compatible high deductible health plan by the open enrollment period for the 2015 plan year.\n\n5. The board is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for the administration and implementation of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2007, shall be invalid and void.\n\n6.
