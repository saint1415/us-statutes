As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Contractor\":\n\n(a) A person or business entity who:\n\na. Provides or arranges for construction services on a public works project under contract to a public entity for a governmental purpose; or\n\nb. Contracts, provides, or arranges for construction services on a public works project for a nongovernmental purpose when acting as a lessee, agent, designee, or representative of a public entity;\n\n(b) Contractor shall not include:\n\na.

It is hereby made the duty of all public entities in this state, in making contracts for public works exempt from attachment and execution under section 513.455, the cost of which is estimated to exceed fifty thousand dollars, to be performed for:\n\n(1) The public entity; or\n\n(2) The public entity's lessee, agent, designee, or representative on work for nongovernmental purposes,\n\n­­to require every contractor for such work to furnish to the public entity a bond with good and sufficient sureties, in an amount fixed by the public entity. Such bond, among other conditions, shall be conditioned for the payment of any and all materials, incorporated, consumed or used in connection with the construction of such work; all insurance premiums, both for compensation, and for all other kinds of insurance, on said work; and for all labor performed in such work whether by a subcontractor, a supplier at any tier, or otherwise. Remote suppliers shall not be entitled to recovery under the bond required by this section, unless such suppliers shall have given written notice to the contractor that it has not been paid within ninety days of the time the supplier last supplied materials on the public works project.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a public official to independently confirm the existence or solvency of any bonding company if a contractor represents to the public official that the bonding company is solvent and that the representations made in the purported bond are true and correct. This subsection shall not relieve from any liability any public official who has any actual knowledge of the insolvency of any bonding company, or any public official who does not act in good faith in complying with the provisions of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n5. A public entity may defend, save harmless and indemnify any of its public officials, whether elected, employed, or appointed, against any claim or demand, whether groundless or otherwise arising out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of a duty under this section. The provisions of this subsection do not apply in case of malfeasance in office or willful or wanton neglect of duty.\n\n6. If consent that meets the requirements of subsection 2 of section 513.455 has been executed and recorded as therein required, no bond is required to be furnished under this section.\n\n7. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require any public entity's lessee, agent, designee, or representative that contracts with a contractor to provide construction services for a public works project intended be leased primarily to a private entity for nongovernmental use to furnish a bond when the contractor is required to furnish a bond under this section or in fact furnishes a complying bond.\n\n8. The providing of a bond under this section shall preclude the filing of a mechanic's lien under chapter 429 by any subcontractor or supplier. Any mechanic's lien filed in violation hereof shall be void and unenforceable and shall be summarily discharged by a judge of the county in which the mechanic's lien is filed.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3277, A.L. 1959 S.B. 294, A.L. 1993 S.B. 278, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1063, A.L. 1995 H.B. 622, A.L. 1997 S.B. 437, A.L. 2014 S.B. 529, A.L. 2019 S.B. 167, A.L. 2025 H.B. 199)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 2890; 1919 § 1040; 1909 § 1247\n\nCROSS REFERENCES:\n\nActions on such bonds, how brought, 522.300\n\nWage rates to be paid employees on construction of public works, 290.210 to 290.340\n\n(1993) If county commission fails to obtain payment bond from contractor on public works project as required by statute, such failure exposes county commissioners to liability for payment of mechanics' lien filed by materialman when materialman furnished materials for project in good faith.
