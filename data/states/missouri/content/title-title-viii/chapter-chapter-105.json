The following definitions shall be applied to the terms used in this section:\n\n(1)\"Governing body\", the board, body, or persons in which the powers of a political subdivision as a body corporate, or otherwise, are vested;\n\n(2)\"Political subdivision\", any agency or unit of this state, except counties and school districts, which now is, or hereafter shall be, authorized to levy taxes or empowered to cause taxes to be levied.\n\n2. The governing body of each political subdivision in the state shall cause to be prepared an annual report of the financial transactions of the political subdivision in such summary form as the state auditor shall prescribe by rule, except that the annual report of political subdivisions whose cash receipts for the reporting period are ten thousand dollars or less shall only be required to contain the cash balance at the beginning of the reporting period, a summary of cash receipts, a summary of cash disbursements and the cash balance at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. Within such time following the end of the fiscal year as the state auditor shall prescribe by rule, the governing body of each political subdivision shall cause a copy of the annual financial report to be remitted to the state auditor.\n\n4.

In any fiscal year no member of the governing body of any political subdivision of the state shall receive any compensation or payment of expenses after the end of the time within which the financial statement of the political subdivision is required to be filed with the state auditor and until such time as the notice from the state auditor of the filing of the annual financial report for the fiscal year has been received.\n\n6. The state auditor shall prepare sample forms for financial reports and shall mail the same to the political subdivisions of the state. Failure of the auditor to supply such forms shall not in any way excuse any person from the performance of any duty imposed by this section.\n\n7. All reports or financial statements hereinabove mentioned shall be considered to be public records.\n\n8. The provisions of this section apply to the board of directors of every transportation development district organized under sections 238.200 to 238.275.\n\n9.

The state auditor shall report any violation of subsection 9 of this section to the department of revenue. Upon notification from the state auditor's office that a political subdivision failed to timely submit a copy of the annual financial statement, the department of revenue shall notify such political subdivision by certified mail that the statement has not been received. Such notice shall clearly set forth the following:\n\n(1) The name of the political subdivision;\n\n(2) That the political subdivision shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars per day if the political subdivision does not submit a copy of the annual financial statement to the state auditor's office within thirty days from the postmarked date stamped on the certified mail envelope;\n\n(3) That the fine will be enforced and collected as provided under subsection 11 of this section; and\n\n(4) That the fine will begin accruing on the thirty-first day from the postmarked date stamped on the certified mail envelope and will continue to accrue until the state auditor's office receives a copy of the financial statement.\n\n­­In the event a copy of the annual financial statement is received within such thirty-day period, no fine shall accrue or be imposed. The state auditor shall report receipt of the financial statement to the department of revenue within ten business days. Failure of the political subdivision to submit the required annual financial statement within such thirty-day period shall cause the fine to be collected as provided under subsection 11 of this section.\n\n11.

The director of revenue shall retain two percent for the cost of such collection. The remaining revenues collected from such violations shall be distributed annually to the schools of the county in the same manner that proceeds for all penalties, forfeitures, and fines collected for any breach of the penal laws of the state are distributed.\n\n12. (1) Any political subdivision that has gross revenues of less than five thousand dollars or that has not levied or collected sales or use taxes in the fiscal year for which the annual financial statement was not timely filed shall not be subject to the fine authorized in this section.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no political subdivision with fewer than five hundred inhabitants shall be subject to the fine authorized in this section, and any fine or fines previously assessed to such political subdivision but not paid in full shall be deemed void.

If a failure to timely submit the annual financial statement is the result of fraud or other illegal conduct by an employee or officer of the political subdivision, the political subdivision shall not be subject to a fine authorized under this section if the statement is filed within thirty days of the discovery of the fraud or illegal conduct. If a fine is assessed and paid prior to the filing of the statement, the department of revenue shall refund the fine upon notification from the political subdivision.\n\n14. If a political subdivision has an outstanding balance for fines or penalties at the time it files its first annual financial statement after August 28, 2025, the director of revenue shall make a one-time downward adjustment to such outstanding balance in an amount that reduces the outstanding balance by no less than ninety percent.\n\n15. The director of revenue shall have the authority to make a one-time downward adjustment to any outstanding penalty imposed under this section on a political subdivision if the director determines the fine is uncollectable. The director of revenue may prescribe rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1965 p. 227 §§ 1 to 10, A.L. 1983 S.B. 88, A.L. 2009 H.B. 191, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1418, A.L. 2017 S.B. 112, A.L. 2022 H.B. 1606, A.L. 2025 H.B. 199 merged with S.B. 2)",

Representation of bargaining unit, procedure, election — decertification, procedure — fees for election. —1. Any labor organization wishing to represent a bargaining unit as an exclusive bargaining representative shall present to the board cards containing the signatures of at least thirty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit indicating that they wish to select the labor organization in question as their exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of collective bargaining. Voluntary recognition by any public body of a labor organization as an exclusive bargaining representative shall be prohibited. Recognition as an exclusive bargaining representative may only be obtained by a labor organization through an election conducted under this section.\n\n2. Upon receiving such cards, the board shall request from the public body a list of all public employees within the bargaining unit and the public body shall provide to the board such list no later than ten business days following receipt of such request. The board shall validate the signatures on the cards and confirm that at least thirty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit have signed the cards. If the board determines that at least thirty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit have signed valid cards, the board shall consult with the public body and the representative of the labor organization that has presented the cards, and together they shall select a mutually agreeable date for a secret ballot election to take place. The election shall be conducted at the public body's place of business or by mail-in ballot, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the chairman of the board, and shall be set for a date falling no less than four weeks, and no more than eight weeks, after the day upon which the board determines the bargaining unit for election and has resolved any other bargaining unit issues.\n\n3. Once an election date has been set, the public body shall issue a notice informing all eligible voters of the date, time, and place of the election. Such notice shall be distributed to all public employees and shall be posted within the public body's place of business.\n\n4. All public employees shall have the right to freely express their opinions about whether the labor organization should be selected as the exclusive bargaining representative of the public employees in the bargaining unit. However, no employee or representative of the labor organization and no public body or representative of the public body shall attempt to threaten, intimidate, coerce, or otherwise restrain any eligible voter in the free exercise of his or her individual choice to support or oppose the selection of the labor organization in question as the exclusive bargaining representative of the public employees in the bargaining unit.\n\n5. Elections shall be conducted by secret ballot, using such procedures as the board shall determine are appropriate for ensuring the privacy and security of each public employee's vote. Once the poll is closed, the board shall oversee the counting of the ballots. One representative of the public body's management team and one representative of the labor organization shall have the right to be present during the counting of the ballots.\n\n6. The ballots shall read: \"Do you wish to select (labor organization) as the exclusive bargaining representative for (description of bargaining unit) employed within (description of public body)?\". The ballot shall include check boxes for marking \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to this question.\n\n7. If more than one labor organization seeks to represent public employees in the bargaining unit, and if both labor organizations have obtained signatures from at least thirty percent of the public employees in the unit stating that they wish to designate the labor organization as their exclusive bargaining representative, the ballot shall read: \"Do you wish to select (labor organization A), (labor organization B), or no labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative for (description of bargaining unit) employed within (description of public body)?\". The ballot shall include check boxes for marking \"I wish to select (labor organization A) as my exclusive bargaining representative.\", \"I wish to select (labor organization B) as my exclusive bargaining representative.\", and \"I do not wish to select any labor organization as my exclusive bargaining representative.\".\n\n8. Any labor organization receiving the votes of more than fifty percent of all public employees in the bargaining unit shall be designated and recognized by the public body as the exclusive bargaining representative for all public employees in the bargaining unit.\n\n9. Public employees within the bargaining unit shall have the right to seek to decertify the labor organization as their exclusive bargaining representative at any time. If any public employee within the bargaining unit presents to the board cards bearing the signatures of at least thirty percent of the public employees within the bargaining unit stating that those public employees no longer wish to be represented by the labor organization in question, the board shall confirm the signatures on the cards. The board shall request from the public body a list of all public employees within the bargaining unit and the public body shall provide such list no later than ten business days following the receipt of such request.\n\n10. If the board confirms that at least thirty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit have signed decertification cards, the board shall consult with the public body and the designated representative of the labor organization to select a date for a decertification election. Such election shall take place at least four weeks, but no later than six weeks, after the board receives the decertification cards. Notice of such election shall be distributed to all public employees within the bargaining unit and posted within the public body's place of business. The election shall be conducted at the public body's place of business or by mail-in ballot, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the chairman of the board.\n\n11. If more than fifty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit cast votes to terminate the labor organization's representation of the public employees in the bargaining unit, the labor organization shall immediately cease to represent the public employees in the bargaining unit.\n\n12. All labor organizations that have previously been certified shall be recertified during the twelve-month period beginning on August 28, 2018, provided that any labor organization that has a labor agreement that expires after August 28, 2020, may be recertified at any time prior to, but in no event later than, August 28, 2020. All subsequent recertification elections shall be held every three years. To meet the recertification requirement, continuation of the labor organization's status as the exclusive bargaining representative shall be favored in a secret ballot election conducted by the board by more than fifty percent of the public employees in the bargaining unit. Public employees shall vote by telephone or online during a two-week period beginning on the anniversary of initial certification, whether such certification occurred prior to, on, or after August 28, 2018. Failure to schedule an election within the prescribed time period on the part of the labor organization shall result in immediate decertification as the exclusive bargaining representative.\n\n13. In the event of the decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative of the public employees in any bargaining unit or failure to recertify a labor organization, all terms and conditions of employment existing at the time of decertification or failure to recertify shall remain in place until such time as those terms or conditions of employment are altered by the public body.\n\n14. No more than one election shall take place in any bargaining unit within the same twelve-month period. Once an election takes place, the board shall not accept cards from labor organizations or public employees within the bargaining unit seeking another election for one full calendar year after the date of the election.\n\n15. The board shall assess and collect a fee from each labor organization participating in an election conducted under this section for the purpose of paying for such election as follows:\n\n(1) For a bargaining unit of one to one hundred members, a fee of two hundred dollars;\n\n(2) For a bargaining unit of one hundred one to two hundred fifty members, a fee of three hundred fifty dollars;\n\n(3) For a bargaining unit of two hundred fifty-one to five hundred members, a fee of five hundred dollars;\n\n(4) For a bargaining unit of five hundred one to one thousand members, a fee of seven hundred fifty dollars;\n\n(5) For a bargaining unit of one thousand one to three thousand members, a fee of one thousand five hundred dollars;\n\n(6) For a bargaining unit of more than three thousand members, a fee of two thousand dollars.\n\n(L. 2018 H.B. 1413)\n\n*Revisor's Note: On June 1, 2021, this section was declared unconstitutional in Missouri National Education Association v.

As used in this section, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Accumulated contributions\", the sum of all amounts deducted from the compensation of an individual and credited to the person's individual account in the applicable plan, together with interest allowed thereon by the plan;\n\n(2)\"Creditable service\", the service of an individual, whether rendered while a member of a plan or not, which is recognized by a plan in determining the individual's eligibility for and the amount of the individual's benefits under the plan;\n\n(3)\"Plan\"or\"retirement plan\", any retirement system established by the state of Missouri or any political subdivision or instrumentality of the state for the purpose of providing plan benefits for elected or appointed public officials or employees of the state of Missouri or any political subdivision or instrumentality of the state;\n\n(4)\"Receiving plan\", a plan which pursuant to this section is receiving funds from another plan or an individual to provide creditable service for that individual;\n\n(5)\"Transferring plan\", a plan which pursuant to this section is transferring funds to another plan for the purpose of providing creditable service for an individual;\n\n(6)\"Vested\", having the right to receive the payment of a benefit from the plan, whether at present or at a future time. For the purpose of determining eligibility for transferring service credit, all plans shall be deemed to have five-year vesting.\n\n2. Any retirement plan as defined in this section may enter into cooperative agreements to transfer creditable service from one retirement plan to another when a member who has been employed in a position covered by one plan is employed in a position covered by another plan.

Any individual who has not yet retired and has earned creditable service under the provisions of a retirement plan which has entered into a cooperative agreement as specified in subsection 2 of this section, and who is vested in any plan may elect in writing to transfer the individual's creditable service from one plan to another plan upon employment and vesting in a position covered by the receiving plan. Within sixty days of such election the plan from which the individual is transferring shall transfer on the individual's behalf to the receiving plan an amount equal to the employee's pension benefit obligation at the time of transfer using the same assumption used in performing the last regular actuarial valuation of the transferring plan; except that in no event shall the transferred amount be less than the employee's accumulated contributions on deposit with the transferring plan.\n\n4. The receiving plan shall determine, using accepted actuarial methods, the value of transferred service in the receiving plan. The amount of creditable service which shall be recognized in the receiving plan shall be determined by the actuarial value of the funds transferred, but in no event shall such creditable service exceed the actual number of years of creditable service from the transferring plan. If the actuarial value of the funds transferred to the receiving plan is less than that required to fund the liability created by the actual number of years of creditable service in the transferring plan, the employee may purchase additional creditable service in the receiving plan up to the actual number of years of creditable service in the transferring plan by paying the amount required by the receiving plan.\n\n5. Any individual having earned creditable service under the provisions of any of the retirement plans identified in this section who is not vested in such plans and who becomes employed and vested in a position covered by another retirement plan identified in this section shall be permitted to purchase creditable service in the plan in which the individual is vested up to the actual number of years of creditable service the individual has in the other plans. The cost shall be determined using accepted actuarial methods by the receiving plan.\n\n6. Payment in full of an amount due by an individual electing to transfer or purchase creditable service pursuant to this section shall be made over a period not to exceed two years, measured from the date of election, or prior to the effective date of retirement benefit payments to that individual by the receiving plan, whichever is earlier, and with interest compounded annually at the actuarially assumed interest rate of the plan receiving the payments. If payment in full is not made within this prescribed time period, any partial payments made by the individual because of the election shall be refunded, and no creditable service shall be allowable in the receiving plan as a result of the partial payments.\n\n7. Any individual employed in nonfederal public employment in Missouri but not covered by a retirement plan who becomes employed and vested in a position covered by a retirement plan identified in this section shall be permitted to purchase creditable service in the plan up to the actual number of years of public service in an uncovered position. The cost and creditable service allowed shall be determined using accepted actuarial methods by the receiving plan.\n\n8.

Participating employees must authorize that such deferrals be made from their wages for the purpose of participation in such program. An election to defer compensation shall be made before the beginning of the month in which the compensation is paid. Contributions shall be made for payroll periods occurring on or after the first day of the month after the election is made.

Employees who are employed by a state college or university shall not be automatically enrolled but may elect to participate in the plan and make contributions in accordance with the terms of the plan. Employees who are enrolled automatically may elect to change the contribution rate in accordance with the terms of the plan. Employees who elect not to participate in the plan may at a later date elect to participate in the plan and make contributions in accordance with the terms of the plan.

Any state employee who has accrued any overtime hours may choose to use those hours as compensatory leave time provided that the leave time is available and agreed upon by both the state employee and his or her supervisor.\n\n2. A state employee who is a nonexempt employee pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be eligible for payment of overtime in accordance with subsection 5 of this section. A nonexempt state employee who works on a designated state holiday shall be granted equal compensatory time off duty or shall receive, at his or her choice, the employee's straight time hourly rate in cash payment. A nonexempt state employee shall be paid in cash for overtime unless the employee requests compensatory time off at the applicable overtime rate. As used in this section, the term\"state employee\"means any person who is employed by the state and earns a salary or wage in a position normally requiring the actual performance by him or her of duties on behalf of the state, but shall not include any employee who is exempt under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any employee of the general assembly.\n\n3.

Ethics commission established — appointment — qualifications — terms — vacancies — removal — restrictions — compensation — administrative secretary — filings required — investigators — powers and duties of commission — advisory opinions, effect — audits. —1. A bipartisan \"Missouri Ethics Commission\", composed of six members, is hereby established. The commission shall be assigned to the office of administration with supervision by the office of administration only for budgeting and reporting as provided by subdivisions (4) and (5) of subsection 6 of section 1 of the Reorganization Act of 1974. Supervision by the office of administration shall not extend to matters relating to policies, regulative functions or appeals from decisions of the commission, and the commissioner of administration, any employee of the office of administration, or the governor, either directly or indirectly, shall not participate or interfere with the activities of the commission in any manner not specifically provided by law and shall not in any manner interfere with the budget request of or withhold any moneys appropriated to the commission by the general assembly. All members of the commission shall be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate from lists submitted pursuant to this section. Each congressional district committee of the political parties having the two highest number of votes cast for their candidate for governor at the last gubernatorial election shall submit two names of eligible nominees for membership on the commission to the governor, and the governor shall select six members from such nominees to serve on the commission.\n\n2. Within thirty days of submission of the person's name to the governor as provided in subsection 1 of this section, and in order to be an eligible nominee for appointment to the commission, a person shall file a financial interest statement in the manner provided by section 105.485 and shall provide the governor, the president pro tempore of the senate, and the commission with a list of all political contributions and the name of the candidate or committee, political party, or continuing committee, as defined in chapter 130, to which those contributions were made within the four-year period prior to such appointment, made by the nominee, the nominee's spouse, or any business entity in which the nominee has a substantial interest. The information shall be maintained by the commission and available for public inspection during the period of time during which the appointee is a member of the commission. In order to be an eligible nominee for membership on the commission, a person shall be a citizen and a resident of the state and shall have been a registered voter in the state for a period of at least five years preceding the person's appointment.\n\n3. The term of each member shall be for four years, except that of the members first appointed, the governor shall select three members from even-numbered congressional districts and three members from odd-numbered districts. Not more than three members of the commission shall be members of the same political party, nor shall more than one member be from any one United States congressional district. Not more than two members appointed from the even-numbered congressional districts shall be members of the same political party, and no more than two members from the odd-numbered congressional districts shall be members of the same political party. Of the members first appointed, the terms of the members appointed from the odd-numbered congressional districts shall expire on March 15, 1994, and the terms of the members appointed from the even-numbered congressional districts shall expire on March 15, 1996. Thereafter all successor members of the commission shall be appointed for four-year terms. Terms of successor members of the commission shall expire on March fifteenth of the fourth year of their term. No member of the commission shall serve on the commission after the expiration of the member's term. No person shall be appointed to more than one full four-year term on the commission.\n\n4. Vacancies or expired terms on the commission shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made, except as provided in this subsection. Within thirty days of the vacancy or ninety days before the expiration of the term, the names of two eligible nominees for membership on the commission shall be submitted to the governor by the congressional district committees of the political party or parties of the vacating member or members, from the even- or odd-numbered congressional districts, based on the residence of the vacating member or members, other than from the congressional district committees from districts then represented on the commission and from the same congressional district party committee or committees which originally appointed the member or members whose positions are vacated. Appointments to fill vacancies or expired terms shall be made within forty-five days after the deadline for submission of names by the congressional district committees, and shall be subject to the same qualifications for appointment and eligibility as is provided in subsections 2 and 3 of this section. Appointments to fill vacancies for unexpired terms shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term of the member whom the appointee succeeds, and such appointees shall be eligible for appointment to one full four-year term. If the congressional district committee does not submit the required two nominees within the thirty days or if the congressional district committee does not submit the two nominees within an additional thirty days after receiving notice from the governor to submit the nominees, then the governor may appoint a person or persons who shall be subject to the same qualifications for appointment and eligibility as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of this section.\n\n5. The governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, may remove any member only for substantial neglect of duty, inability to discharge the powers and duties of office, gross misconduct or conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude. Members of the commission also may be removed from office by concurrent resolution of the general assembly signed by the governor. If such resolution receives the vote of two-thirds or more of the membership of both houses of the general assembly, the signature of the governor shall not be necessary to effect removal. The office of any member of the commission who moves from the congressional district from which the member was appointed shall be deemed vacated upon such change of residence.\n\n6. The commission shall elect biennially one of its members as the chairman. The chairman may not succeed himself or herself after two years. No member of the commission shall succeed as chairman any member of the same political party as himself or herself. At least four members are necessary to constitute a quorum, and at least four affirmative votes shall be required for any action or recommendation of the commission.\n\n7. No member or employee of the commission, during the person's term of service, shall hold or be a candidate for any other public office.\n\n8. In the event that a retired judge is appointed as a member of the commission, the judge shall not serve as a special investigator while serving as a member of the commission.\n\n9.

Each member of the commission shall receive, as full compensation for the member's services, the sum of one hundred dollars per day for each full day actually spent on work of the commission, and the member's actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of the member's official duties.\n\n11. The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall serve subject to the supervision of and at the pleasure of the commission, but in no event for more than six years. The executive director shall be responsible for the administrative operations of the commission and perform such other duties as may be delegated or assigned to the director by law or by rule of the commission. The executive director shall employ staff and retain such contract services as the director deems necessary, within the limits authorized by appropriations by the general assembly.\n\n12.

Within sixty days of the initial meeting of the first commission appointed, the commission shall obtain from the clerk of the supreme court or the state courts administrator a list of retired appellate and circuit court judges who did not leave the judiciary as a result of being defeated in an election. The executive director shall determine those judges who indicate their desire to serve as special investigators and to investigate any and all complaints referred to them by the commission. The executive director shall maintain an updated list of those judges qualified and available for appointment to serve as special investigators. Such list shall be updated at least annually. The commission shall refer complaints to such special investigators on that list on a rotating schedule which ensures a random assignment of each special investigator. Each special investigator shall receive only one unrelated investigation at a time and shall not be assigned to a second or subsequent investigation until all other eligible investigators on the list have been assigned to an investigation. In the event that no special investigator is qualified or available to conduct a particular investigation, the commission may appoint a special investigator to conduct such particular investigation.\n\n14. The commission shall have the following duties and responsibilities relevant to the impartial and effective enforcement of sections 105.450 to 105.496 and chapter 130, as provided in sections 105.955 to 105.963:\n\n(1) Receive and review complaints regarding alleged violation of sections 105.450 to 105.496 and chapter 130, conduct initial reviews and investigations regarding such complaints as provided herein; refer complaints to appropriate prosecuting authorities and appropriate disciplinary authorities along with recommendations for sanctions; and initiate judicial proceedings as allowed by sections 105.955 to 105.963;\n\n(2) Review and audit any reports and statements required by the campaign finance disclosure laws contained in chapter 130, and financial interest disclosure laws or lobbyist registration and reporting laws as provided by sections 105.470 to 105.492, for timeliness, accuracy and completeness of content as provided in sections 105.955 to 105.963;\n\n(3) Develop appropriate systems to file and maintain an index of all such reports and statements to facilitate public access to such information, except as may be limited by confidentiality requirements otherwise provided by law, including cross-checking of information contained in such statements and reports. The commission may enter into contracts with the appropriate filing officers to effectuate such system. Such filing officers shall cooperate as necessary with the commission as reasonable and necessary to effectuate such purposes;\n\n(4) Provide information and assistance to lobbyists, elected and appointed officials, and employees of the state and political subdivisions in carrying out the provisions of sections 105.450 to 105.496 and chapter 130;\n\n(5) Make recommendations to the governor and general assembly or any state agency on the need for further legislation with respect to the ethical conduct of public officials and employees and to advise state and local government in the development of local government codes of ethics and methods of disclosing conflicts of interest as the commission may deem appropriate to promote high ethical standards among all elected and appointed officials or employees of the state or any political subdivision thereof and lobbyists;\n\n(6) Render advisory opinions as provided by this section;\n\n(7) Promulgate rules relating to the provisions of sections 105.955 to 105.963 and chapter 130.

Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Missouri ethics commission as provided for in subsection 2 of section 105.961; and\n\n(5) Obtain information from any department, division or agency of the state or any political subdivision reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence which will reasonably assist the commission in carrying out the duties prescribed in sections 105.955 to 105.963 and chapter 130.\n\n16. (1) Upon written request for an advisory opinion received by the commission, and if the commission determines that the person requesting the opinion would be directly affected by the application of law to the facts presented by the requesting person, the commission shall issue a written opinion advising the person who made the request, in response to the person's particular request, regarding any issue that the commission can receive a complaint on pursuant to section 105.957. The commission may decline to issue a written opinion by a vote of four members and shall provide to the requesting person the reason for the refusal in writing. The commission shall give an approximate time frame as to when the written opinion shall be issued. Such advisory opinions shall be issued no later than ninety days from the date of receipt by the commission. Such requests and advisory opinions, deleting the name and identity of the requesting person, shall be compiled and published by the commission on at least an annual basis. Advisory opinions issued by the commission shall be maintained and made available for public inspection and copying at the office of the commission during normal business hours. Any advisory opinion or portion of an advisory opinion rendered pursuant to this subsection shall be withdrawn by the commission if, after hearing thereon, the joint committee on administrative rules finds that such advisory opinion is beyond or contrary to the statutory authority of the commission or is inconsistent with the legislative intent of any law enacted by the general assembly, and after the general assembly, by concurrent resolution, votes to adopt the findings and conclusions of the joint committee on administrative rules. Any such concurrent resolution adopted by the general assembly shall be published at length by the commission in its publication of advisory opinions of the commission next following the adoption of such resolution, and a copy of such concurrent resolution shall be maintained by the commission, along with the withdrawn advisory opinion, in its public file of advisory opinions. The commission shall also send a copy of such resolution to the person who originally requested the withdrawn advisory opinion. Any advisory opinion issued by the ethics commission shall act as legal direction to any person requesting such opinion and no person shall be liable for relying on the opinion and it shall act as a defense of justification against prosecution. An advisory opinion of the commission shall not be withdrawn unless:\n\n(a) The authorizing statute is declared unconstitutional;\n\n(b) The opinion goes beyond the power authorized by statute; or\n\n(c) The authorizing statute is changed to invalidate the opinion.\n\n(2) Upon request, the attorney general shall give the attorney general's opinion, without fee, to the commission, any elected official of the state or any political subdivision, any member of the general assembly, or any director of any department, division or agency of the state, upon any question of law regarding the effect or application of sections 105.450 to 105.496, or chapter 130. Such opinion need be in writing only upon request of such official, member or director, and in any event shall be rendered within sixty days that such request is delivered to the attorney general.\n\n17. The state auditor and the state auditor's duly authorized employees who have taken the oath of confidentiality required by section 29.070 may audit the commission and in connection therewith may inspect materials relating to the functions of the commission. Such audit shall include a determination of whether appropriations were spent within the intent of the general assembly, but shall not extend to review of any file or document pertaining to any particular investigation, audit or review by the commission, an investigator or any staff or person employed by the commission or under the supervision of the commission or an investigator. The state auditor and any employee of the state auditor shall not disclose the identity of any person who is or was the subject of an investigation by the commission and whose identity is not public information as provided by law.\n\n18. From time to time but no more frequently than annually the commission may request the officials and entities described in subdivision (6) of section 105.450 to identify for the commission in writing those persons associated with such office or entity which such office or entity has designated as a decision-making public servant. Each office or entity delineated in subdivision (6) of section 105.450 receiving such a request shall identify those so designated within thirty days of the commission's request.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 262 § 1, A.L. 1994 S.B. 650, A.L. 1995 H.B. 484, et al., A.L. 1996 S.B. 501, A.L. 1997 S.B. 16, A.L. 1999 S.B. 31 & 285, A.L. 2010 S.B. 844, A.L. 2015 S.B. 58)\n\n*Revisor's Note: S.B. 844, 2010, amended this section but was declared unconstitutional in Legends Bank v.

All investigations by the executive director of an alleged violation shall be strictly confidential with the exception of notification of the commission and the complainant or the person under investigation. All investigations by the executive director shall be limited to the information contained in the reports or statements.

Special investigator — report — commission review, determination — special prosecutor — hearings — action of commission — formal proceedings — appropriate disciplinary authorities — powers of investigators — fees and expenses — confidentiality, penalty — compensation. —1. Upon receipt of a complaint as described by section 105.957, the commission shall assign the complaint to a special investigator, who may be a commission employee, who shall investigate and determine the merits of the complaint. Within ten days of such assignment, the special investigator shall review such complaint and disclose, in writing, to the commission any conflict of interest which the special investigator has or might have with respect to the investigation and subject thereof. Within one hundred twenty days of receipt of the complaint from the commission, the special investigator shall submit the special investigator's report to the commission. The commission, after review of such report, shall determine:\n\n(1) That there is reasonable grounds for belief that a violation has occurred; or\n\n(2) That there are no reasonable grounds for belief that a violation exists and the complaint should be dismissed; or\n\n(3) That additional time is necessary to complete the investigation, and the status and progress of the investigation to date. The commission, in its discretion, may allow the investigation to proceed for additional successive periods of one hundred twenty days each, pending reports regarding the status and progress of the investigation at the end of each such period.\n\n2. When the commission concludes, based on the report from the special investigator, or based on an audit conducted pursuant to section 105.959, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of any criminal law has occurred, and if the commission believes that criminal prosecution would be appropriate upon a vote of four members of the commission, the commission shall refer the report to the Missouri office of prosecution services, prosecutors coordinators training council established in section 56.760, which shall submit a panel of five attorneys for recommendation to the court having criminal jurisdiction, for appointment of an attorney to serve as a special prosecutor; except that, the attorney general of Missouri or any assistant attorney general shall not act as such special prosecutor. The court shall then appoint from such panel a special prosecutor pursuant to section 56.110 who shall have all the powers provided by section 56.130. The court shall allow a reasonable and necessary attorney's fee for the services of the special prosecutor. Such fee shall be assessed as costs if a case is filed, or ordered by the court if no case is filed, and paid together with all other costs in the proceeding by the state, in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the state courts administrator, subject to funds appropriated to the office of administration for such purposes. If the commission does not have sufficient funds to pay a special prosecutor, the commission shall refer the case to the prosecutor or prosecutors having criminal jurisdiction. If the prosecutor having criminal jurisdiction is not able to prosecute the case due to a conflict of interest, the court may appoint a special prosecutor, paid from county funds, upon appropriation by the county or the attorney general to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute the case. The special prosecutor or prosecutor shall commence an action based on the report by the filing of an information or seeking an indictment within sixty days of the date of such prosecutor's appointment, or shall file a written statement with the commission explaining why criminal charges should not be sought. If the special prosecutor or prosecutor fails to take either action required by this subsection, upon request of the commission, a new special prosecutor, who may be the attorney general, shall be appointed. The report may also be referred to the appropriate disciplinary authority over the person who is the subject of the report.\n\n3. When the commission concludes, based on the report from the special investigator or based on an audit conducted pursuant to section 105.959, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of any law has occurred which is not a violation of criminal law or that criminal prosecution is not appropriate, the commission shall conduct a hearing which shall be a closed meeting and not open to the public. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures provided by sections 536.063 to 536.090 and shall be considered to be a contested case for purposes of such sections. The commission shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not that there is probable cause that a violation has occurred. If the commission determines, by a vote of at least four members of the commission, that probable cause exists that a violation has occurred, the commission may refer its findings and conclusions to the appropriate disciplinary authority over the person who is the subject of the report, as described in subsection 7 of this section. After the commission determines by a vote of at least four members of the commission that probable cause exists that a violation has occurred, and the commission has referred the findings and conclusions to the appropriate disciplinary authority over the person subject of the report, the subject of the report may appeal the determination of the commission to the administrative hearing commission. Such appeal shall stay the action of the Missouri ethics commission. Such appeal shall be filed not later than the fourteenth day after the subject of the commission's action receives actual notice of the commission's action.\n\n4. If the appropriate disciplinary authority receiving a report from the commission pursuant to subsection 3 of this section fails to follow, within sixty days of the receipt of the report, the recommendations contained in the report, or if the commission determines, by a vote of at least four members of the commission that some action other than referral for criminal prosecution or for action by the appropriate disciplinary authority would be appropriate, the commission shall take any one or more of the following actions:\n\n(1) Notify the person to cease and desist violation of any provision of law which the report concludes was violated and that the commission may seek judicial enforcement of its decision pursuant to subsection 5 of this section;\n\n(2) Notify the person of the requirement to file, amend or correct any report, statement, or other document or information required by sections 105.473, 105.483 to 105.492, or chapter 130 and that the commission may seek judicial enforcement of its decision pursuant to subsection 5 of this section; and\n\n(3) File the report with the executive director to be maintained as a public document; or\n\n(4) Issue a letter of concern or letter of reprimand to the person, which would be maintained as a public document; or\n\n(5) Issue a letter that no further action shall be taken, which would be maintained as a public document; or\n\n(6) Through reconciliation agreements or civil action, the power to seek fees for violations in an amount not greater than one thousand dollars or double the amount involved in the violation.\n\n5. Upon vote of at least four members, the commission may initiate formal judicial proceedings seeking to obtain any of the following orders:\n\n(1) Cease and desist violation of any provision of sections 105.450 to 105.496, or chapter 130, or sections 105.955 to 105.963;\n\n(2) Pay any civil penalties required by sections 105.450 to 105.496 or chapter 130;\n\n(3) File any reports, statements, or other documents or information required by sections 105.450 to 105.496, or chapter 130; or\n\n(4) Pay restitution for any unjust enrichment the violator obtained as a result of any violation of any criminal statute as described in subsection 6 of this section.­­The Missouri ethics commission shall give actual notice to the subject of the complaint of the proposed action as set out in this section. The subject of the complaint may appeal the action of the Missouri ethics commission, other than a referral for criminal prosecution, to the administrative hearing commission. Such appeal shall stay the action of the Missouri ethics commission. Such appeal shall be filed no later than fourteen days after the subject of the commission's actions receives actual notice of the commission's actions.\n\n­­The Missouri ethics commission shall give actual notice to the subject of the complaint of the proposed action as set out in this section.

The special investigator having a complaint referred to the special investigator by the commission shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) To request and shall be given access to information in the possession of any person or agency which the special investigator deems necessary for the discharge of the special investigator's responsibilities;\n\n(2) To examine the records and documents of any person or agency, unless such examination would violate state or federal law providing for confidentiality;\n\n(3) To administer oaths and affirmations;\n\n(4) Upon refusal by any person to comply with a request for information relevant to an investigation, an investigator may issue a subpoena for any person to appear and give testimony, or for a subpoena duces tecum to produce documentary or other evidence which the investigator deems relevant to a matter under the investigator's inquiry. The subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum may be enforced by applying to a judge of the circuit court of Cole County or any county where the person or entity that has been subpoenaed resides or may be found, for an order to show cause why the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum should not be enforced. The order and a copy of the application therefor shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action, and if, after hearing, the court determines that the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum should be sustained and enforced, the court shall enforce the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum in the same manner as if it had been issued by the court in a civil action; and\n\n(5) To request from the commission such investigative, clerical or other staff assistance or advancement of other expenses which are necessary and convenient for the proper completion of an investigation. Within the limits of appropriations to the commission, the commission may provide such assistance, whether by contract to obtain such assistance or from staff employed by the commission, or may advance such expenses.\n\n9. (1) Any retired judge may request in writing to have the judge's name removed from the list of special investigators subject to appointment by the commission or may request to disqualify himself or herself from any investigation. Such request shall include the reasons for seeking removal;\n\n(2) By vote of four members of the commission, the commission may disqualify a judge from a particular investigation or may permanently remove the name of any retired judge from the list of special investigators subject to appointment by the commission.\n\n10.

The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit or affect any other remedy or right of appeal or objection.\n\n12. No person shall be required to make or file a complaint to the commission as a prerequisite for exhausting the person's administrative remedies before pursuing any civil cause of action allowed by law.\n\n13. If, in the opinion of the commission, the complaining party was motivated by malice or reason contrary to the spirit of any law on which such complaint was based, in filing the complaint without just cause, this finding shall be reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Any person who knowingly files a complaint without just cause, or with malice, is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n14. A respondent party who prevails in a formal judicial action brought by the commission shall be awarded those reasonable fees and expenses incurred by that party in the formal judicial action, unless the court finds that the position of the commission was substantially justified or that special circumstances make such an award unjust.\n\n15.
