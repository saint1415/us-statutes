In addition, a uniformed member of the highway patrol who is retiring with a normal annuity after attaining normal retirement age shall receive an additional sum of ninety dollars per month as a contribution by the system until such member attains the age of sixty-five years, when such contribution shall cease. To qualify for the contribution provided in this subsection by the system, the retired uniformed member of the highway patrol is made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging and other state matters. Such additional contribution shall be reduced each month by such amount earned by the retired uniformed member of the highway patrol in gainful employment.

In no event shall the monthly benefit payable for the lifetime of the member be greater than the amount that would have been payable to the member under subsection 7 or 8 of section 104.103, whichever is applicable, had the former spouse died on the date of the dissolution of marriage.

Benefits otherwise payable to a child under eighteen years of age shall be payable to the surviving parent as natural guardian of such child if such parent has custody or assumes custody of such minor child, or to the legal conservator of such child, until such child attains age eighteen, and thereafter, the benefit may be paid to the child until age twenty-one; provided, the age twenty-one maximum shall be extended for any child who has been found totally incapacitated by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(3) No benefit is payable pursuant to this section if no eligible surviving spouse or children under twenty-one years of age survive the member.

Retirement system to be body corporate, to be known as Missouri state employees' retirement system — powers and duties — medical benefit funds. —1. For the purpose of providing retirement income and other benefits to employees of the state, there is hereby created and established a retirement system which shall be a body corporate and an instrumentality of the state, which shall be under the management of a board of trustees herein described, and shall be known as the \"Missouri State Employees' Retirement System\". In the system shall be vested the powers and duties specified in sections 104.010 and 104.320 to 104.800 and such other powers as may be necessary or proper to enable it, its officers, employees, and agents to carry out fully and effectively all the purposes of sections 104.010 and 104.320 to 104.800.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the system is also authorized and empowered to provide services in connection with medical benefit funds established or maintained for state employees, retirees, and their dependents who are participants in a state medical plan administered by the Missouri consolidated health care*plan established under section 103.005 or other medical benefit plans established or maintained by the state for its employees, retirees, and their dependents. All such plans described in this section shall be welfare plans referred to as \"State Medical Plans\". The services to be provided by the system shall include, but not be limited to, the investment of assets of such state medical plans. Such services to be provided by the system shall be provided under a trust agreement between the board, as trustee, and the state medical plan, subject to approval by the board of trustees of the Missouri state employees' retirement system and the state medical plan. The system shall be vested with the powers and duties specified in section 104.010 and sections 104.320 to 104.1093 and such other powers as may be necessary or proper to enable it, its officers, employees, and agents to carry out fully and effectively all the purposes of this subsection. Whenever the system is acting under section 104.010 and sections 104.320 to 104.1093 with respect to services provided under this subsection, the provisions of such sections shall be read to apply to services provided under this subsection and not to services provided under subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3.

No such contributions made from the medical benefit plan's trust fund shall be transferred to the board without the approval of the medical benefit plan's governing body. All property, money, funds, investments, and rights so received and accepted by the board together with proceeds and reinvestments thereof shall be dedicated to and held in a separate trust, known as the medical benefit trust, for the exclusive purpose of satisfying the obligations of the applicable state medical plan to pay health care and other medical benefits to employee and retiree participants and their dependents under such state medical plan. At no time shall any part of a medical benefit trust be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive purpose of satisfying the obligations of the applicable state medical plan to provide health care and other medical benefits to employee and retiree participants and their dependents, including payment of benefits on behalf of such participants under such state medical plan and payment of reasonable expenses of the medical benefit trust. The board may establish one or more trust instruments that set forth the terms and conditions for holding, investing, and distributing assets of a medical benefit trust that are consistent with subsection 2 of this section. Such medical benefit trust may be irrevocable. A separate account for a state medical plan may be established under a separate trust instrument. The board may consolidate the retiree assets of one or more medical benefit trusts in a single fund or funds, a \"master trust\", that may be commingled for investment purposes, and subject to the applicable trust agreement, may commingle the retiree assets of one or more medical benefit trusts with assets of the system for investment purposes. In the event the board commingles assets of one or more trusts for investment purposes, it shall maintain separate bookkeeping accounts reflecting the separate share in each investment pool of each participating trust. The board shall have power to purchase, acquire, hold, invest, lend, lease, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of all property, rights, and securities and enter into written contracts and may employ or contract with third-party advisors all as may be necessary or proper to carry out the purposes of this subsection and subsection 2 of this section. The board shall have the power to borrow money for any of the authorized purposes of the board and to issue negotiable notes, bonds, or other instruments in writing in evidence of the sum or sums to be borrowed. Whenever the system is acting under section 104.010 and sections 104.320 to 104.1093 with respect to an account established under this subsection, the provisions of such sections shall be read to apply to an account provided under this subsection and not accounts established under subsection 1 of section 104.440.\n\n4. The board shall make such payments from a medical benefit trust to or for the benefit of the participants in a state medical plan and their dependents, at such time, in such manner, in such amounts, in such form, and for such purposes as may be specified in one or more directives by the state medical plan administrator authorized to direct payment of benefits under such state medical plan from time to time or as provided in a trust agreement governing such medical benefit trust, and the board shall have no responsibility and shall be without liability for any payment made under such direction. The board shall be under no duty or obligation to make any inquiry or investigation as to whether any direction is made under the provisions of any state medical plan and shall not be responsible in any respect for the administration of any state medical plan.

Effective with transfers of service between the Missouri department of transportation and highway patrol employees' retirement system and the Missouri state employees' retirement system that occur on or after September 1, 2011, upon a reciprocal transfer of creditable or credited service pursuant to section 104.602 or subsection 8 of section 104.1021, the sending system from which the service is transferred shall pay the receiving system to which the service is transferred the present value of the accrued benefit as determined pursuant to subsection 2 of this section.\n\n2. For purposes of this section, the present value of the accrued benefit shall be determined using the actuarial assumptions of the sending system used in that system's last regular valuation assuming active member status and using the unit credit actuarial cost method. However, in no event shall the payment amount be less than the sum of the member's accumulated contributions and interest plus any purchased service payments from the member held on deposit by the sending system. If the member had received a refund of accumulated contributions from the sending system and forfeited service credit with that system, the member would need to reestablish that service with the sending system by again becoming an active member of a system covered by this chapter and satisfying requirements otherwise stipulated for reestablishing service credit. However, in the event the member had previously transferred service from the receiving system to the sending system which was not subject to an asset transfer under this section, then that service will be excluded from the computation of the accrued benefit. In the event any prior payments by a sending system under this section included an amount for previously transferred service that was not subject to this section, the receiving system shall return to the sending system the present value amount attributable to such service, including interest as determined and agreed to by both systems.\n\n3. The service transfer shall not be deemed completed until the sending system makes payment to the receiving system as prescribed in this section. Payments shall be made within ninety days of the date that a completed transfer request is submitted by a member.\n\n4. When the transfer payment includes an amount identified as corresponding to a member's accumulated contributions, the accumulated contributions portion shall be identified, and further, the accumulated contributions balance as of the preceding July first shall be identified and the receiving system shall be responsible for crediting interest according to the terms of the receiving plan.\n\n5. The systems shall coordinate their plan administration for reciprocal transfers to give full effect to the transfer including the transfer and acceptance of corresponding division of benefit orders.\n\n6. The member or survivor obtaining a reciprocal transfer of service covered by this section shall satisfy all requirements under section 104.602 or subsection 8 of section 104.1021 to obtain a transfer of credited or creditable service and shall satisfy the requirements under section 104.1091 with the receiving system to reestablish forfeited service previously accrued at either system.\n\n(L. 2011 H.B. 282, A.L. 2012 S.B. 625)",

The annuity of a special consultant who is receiving benefits under the provisions of option 2 of section 104.395, as in effect on or after August 13, 1986, but prior to August 28, 1997, shall be determined in the same manner as an annuity under option 2 of section 104.395, as in effect on September 1, 1997. The annuity of a special consultant who is receiving benefits under an annuity that provides for a continuing lifetime annuity to a surviving spouse other than as previously described in this subdivision shall be reduced in a manner approved by the board so as to be consistent with the other continuing lifetime annuities described in this subdivision. Such annuities shall be adjusted for early retirement if applicable. The member's benefit shall include any formula or minimum benefit increases or both, and cost-of-living increases the retired member would have received since the date of retirement had the member's benefit been calculated as described in this subdivision. The member shall also receive a one-time payment in an amount equal to the difference in the amount of retirement benefits that the member received and the amount the member would have received since the date of retirement had the member's benefit been calculated as described in this subdivision.\n\n(2) Any member who terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, but before August 28, 1997, and who retires after August 28, 1997, may elect at retirement to become a special consultant as provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection and elect any option provided pursuant to section 104.395, as in effect on August 28, 1997.\n\n(3) Any member who terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, but retired prior to August 28, 1997, who applied for increased benefits pursuant to the provisions described in subsection 3 or subsection 4 of section 104.395, and whose spouse died prior to September 1, 1997, and who has been made, constituted and appointed by the board as a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging, and other matters relating to retirement shall be eligible for additional compensation. As additional compensation for such services, such member shall receive a one-time payment in an amount equal to the difference in the amount of retirement benefits that the member received and the amount the member would have received since the date of retirement had the member's benefit been calculated as described in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(4) Any member who terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, but retired before September 1, 1997, and who had elected a normal annuity at retirement, and who is receiving benefits on September 1, 1997, and who has been made, constituted and appointed by the board as a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging, and other matters relating to retirement shall be eligible for additional compensation. As additional compensation for such services, beginning the first month following the death of the member, the member's surviving spouse who was married to the member of the transportation department and highway patrol retirement system on the date of retirement or the person who was married to the member of the Missouri state employees' retirement system on the date of retirement shall receive monthly an amount equal to fifty percent of the monthly annuity the retired member was receiving at the time of the member's death.\n\n(5) If a member dies on or after September 1, 1997, but prior to receiving any one-time payment described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, payment shall be issued to the surviving spouse who was married to the member at the date of the member's death. If there is no surviving spouse, payment will be issued to the member's estate.\n\n(6) Any member who terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, retired, became a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging and other matters relating to retirement or applies to become such a consultant, and whose annuity was not in pay status on September 1, 1997, pursuant to the provisions of section 104.380, shall be eligible for additional compensation. As additional compensation for such services, each special consultant shall be eligible for the benefits described in subdivision (1), (3) or (4) of this subsection depending on the annuity selected by the member at the time of retirement. Any one-time payment that may be due shall be paid upon application for such benefit. Any adjustment to a future annuity shall be made upon application for retirement or survivor benefits.\n\n(7) Any person who received benefits pursuant to subsection 6 of section 104.335 prior to August 28, 1997, may apply to the board to become a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging, and other matters relating to retirement. As compensation for such services, each special consultant shall be eligible to receive upon making application for such benefits a one-time payment which shall be equal to the difference between the amount of benefits the person received and the amount of benefits the person would have received had the original benefit payment been calculated under the actuarial assumptions in effect on August 28, 1997.\n\n(8) Any person who was married to a member of the Missouri state employees' retirement system at the time the member retired and such member terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, elected one of the options providing for a continuing lifetime annuity at the time of retirement, and died prior to September 1, 1997, may apply to the board to become a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging, and other matters relating to retirement. As additional compensation for such services, the survivor benefit of the special consultant shall be recalculated in the manner described in subdivision (1) of this subsection. The special consultant shall also receive a one-time payment in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of retirement and survivor benefits that the retired member and the special consultant received and the amount of retirement and survivor benefits the retired member and the special consultant would have received since the date of retirement had the retired member's and the special consultant's benefits been calculated as described in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(9) Any person who was married to a member of the Missouri state employees' retirement system at the time the member retired and such member terminated employment on or after October 1, 1984, retired after electing a normal annuity, and died prior to September 1, 1997, may apply to the board to become a special consultant on the problems of retirement, aging, and other matters relating to retirement. As additional compensation for such services, the special consultant shall receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to fifty percent of the monthly annuity the retired member was receiving at the time of the member's death, including any annual benefit increases pursuant to subsections 7 and 8 of this section that occurred between the date of the member's death and the date of application.

The employing department shall not certify unused sick leave unless such unused sick leave could have been used by the member for sickness or injury. The rate of accrual of sick leave for purposes of computing years of service pursuant to this section shall be no greater than ten hours per month.

If no surviving parents exist, such amount shall be paid to the surviving brothers or sisters of such member, survivor, or beneficiary in equal parts. If no surviving brothers or sisters exist, payment may be made as otherwise permitted by law. Notwithstanding this subsection, any amount due to a deceased member as payment of all or part of a lump sum pursuant to subsection 6 of section 104.1024 shall be paid to the member's surviving spouse married to the member at the time of death, and otherwise payment may be made as provided in this subsection.

Effective January 1, 2001, the system shall provide or contract or both for basic life insurance for employees covered under any retirement plan administered by the system pursuant to this chapter, persons covered by sections 287.812 to 287.856, for employees who are members of the judicial retirement system as provided in section 476.590, and, at the election of the state highways and transportation commission, employees who are members of the Missouri department of transportation and highway patrol employees' retirement system, in the amount equal to one times annual pay, subject to a minimum amount of fifteen thousand dollars. The board shall establish by rule or contract the method for determining the annual rate of pay and any other terms of such insurance as it deems necessary to implement the requirements pursuant to this section. Annual rate of pay shall not include overtime or any other irregular payments as determined by the board.

The maximum amount of additional life insurance which may be so purchased prior to January 1, 2004, is that amount which equals six times the amount of the person's annual rate of pay, subject to any maximum established by a board, except that if such maximum amount is not evenly divisible by one thousand dollars, then the maximum amount of additional insurance which may be purchased is the next higher amount evenly divisible by one thousand dollars. The maximum amount of additional life insurance which may be so purchased on or after January 1, 2004, is an amount to be stipulated in a contract with a private insurance company or as may be required by the system if the board of trustees determines that the system should provide the insurance itself.\n\n(2) Any person defined in subdivision (1) of this subsection may retain an amount not to exceed sixty thousand dollars of life insurance following the date of his or her retirement if such person becomes a retiree the month following termination of employment and makes written application for such life insurance at the same time such person's application is made to the board for retirement benefits. Such life insurance shall only be provided if such person pays the entire cost of the insurance, as determined by the board, by allowing voluntary deductions from the member's annuity.\n\n(3) In addition to the life insurance authorized in subdivision (1) of this subsection, any person for whom life insurance is provided or contracted for pursuant to this subsection may purchase, at the person's own expense and only if monthly voluntary payroll deductions are authorized, life insurance covering the person's children or the person's spouse or both at coverage amounts to be determined by the board at a cost to be stipulated in a contract with a private insurer or as may be required by the system if the board of trustees determines that the system should provide such insurance itself.\n\n(4) Effective July 1, 2000, any member who applies and is eligible to receive an annuity based on the attainment of at least forty-eight years of age with a total of years of age and years of credited service which is at least eighty shall be eligible to retain any optional life insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection. The amount of such retained insurance shall not be greater than the amount in effect during the month prior to termination of employment.

The state highways and transportation commission may provide medical benefits for dependents of members and for retired members. Contributions by the state highways and transportation commission to provide the benefits shall be on the same basis as provided for other state employees pursuant to the provisions of section 104.515. Except as otherwise provided by law, the cost of benefits for dependents of members and for retirees and their dependents shall be paid by the members or retirees. The commission may contract with other persons or entities including but not limited to third-party administrators, health network providers and health maintenance organizations for all, or any part of, the benefits provided for in this section. The commission may require reimbursement of any medical claims paid by the commission's medical plan for which there was third-party liability.\n\n4.

The person who is covered pursuant to subsection 2 of this section shall be solely responsible for the costs of any additional life insurance. In lieu of the life insurance benefit in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section, the Missouri department of transportation and highway patrol employees' retirement system is authorized in its sole discretion to provide a death benefit of five thousand dollars.\n\n5.

The contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of determining the member's pay that is includable in the member's gross income for federal income tax purposes;\n\n(2) Member contributions picked up by the employer shall be paid from the same source of funds used for the payment of pay to a member. A deduction shall be made from each member's pay equal to the amount of the member's contributions picked up by the employer. This deduction, however, shall not reduce the member's pay for purposes of computing benefits under the retirement system pursuant to this chapter;\n\n(3) Member contributions so picked up shall be credited to a separate account within the member's individual account so that the amounts contributed pursuant to this section may be distinguished from the amounts contributed on an after-tax basis;\n\n(4) The contributions, although designated as employee contributions, shall be paid by the employer in lieu of the contributions by the member. The member shall not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system;\n\n(5) Interest shall be credited annually on June thirtieth based on the value in the account as of July first of the immediately preceding year at a rate of four percent. Effective June 30, 2014, and each June thirtieth thereafter, the interest crediting rate shall be equal to the investment rate that is published by the United States Department of the Treasury, or its successor agency, for fifty-two week treasury bills for the relevant auction that is nearest to the preceding July first, or a successor treasury bill investment rate as approved by the board if the fifty-two week treasury bill is no longer issued.

Such refund shall be paid by the system within an administratively reasonable period, but no sooner than ninety days from the date of termination of employment. The amount refunded shall include all employee contributions made to any retirement plan administered by the system and interest credited thereon. A vested former member may not request a refund after such member becomes eligible for normal retirement. A vested former member or a former member who is not vested who receives a refund shall forfeit all the member's credited service and future rights to receive benefits from the system and shall not be eligible to receive any disability benefits; provided that any member or vested former member receiving disability benefits shall not be eligible for a refund. If such member subsequently becomes an employee and works continuously for at least one year, the credited service previously forfeited shall be restored if the member returns to the system the amount previously refunded plus interest at a rate established by the board;\n\n(7) The beneficiary of any member who made contributions shall receive a refund upon the member's death equal to the amount, if any, of such contributions and interest credited thereon less any retirement benefits received by the member unless an annuity is payable to a survivor or beneficiary as a result of the member's death. In that event, the beneficiary of the survivor or beneficiary who received the annuity shall receive a refund upon the survivor's or beneficiary's death equal to the amount, if any, of the member's contributions less any annuity amounts received by the member and the survivor or beneficiary.\n\n9.

If the beneficiary survives the retiree but dies before receiving the remainder of such one hundred eighty monthly payments, the present value of the remaining annuity payments shall be paid as provided under subsection 3 of section 104.620.\n\n11.
