The state treasurer shall prepare, maintain and adhere to a written investment policy which shall include an asset allocation plan which limits the total amount of state moneys which may be invested in any particular investment authorized by Section 15, Article IV of the Missouri Constitution. Such asset allocation plan shall also set diversification limits, as applicable, which shall include a restriction limiting the total amount of time deposits of state moneys, not including linked deposits, placed with any one single banking institution to be no greater than fifteen percent of all time deposits of state moneys authorized under the asset allocation plan.

The state treasurer may also place state moneys which are determined not needed for current operations of the state government in linked deposits as provided in sections 30.750 to 30.765.\n\n4. Except for state moneys deposited in linked deposits as provided in sections 30.750 to 30.860, the rate of interest payable by all banking institutions on time deposits of state moneys shall be set under subdivisions (1) to (5) of this subsection and subsections 6 and 7 of this section. The rate shall never exceed the maximum rate of interest which by federal law or regulation a bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System may from time to time pay on a time deposit of the same size and maturity. The rate of interest payable by all banking institutions on time deposits of state moneys is as follows:\n\n(1) Beginning January 1, 2010, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution on up to seven million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be the same as the average rate paid during the week next preceding the week in which the deposit was made for United States of America treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to the time of termination of the deposit, as determined by the state treasurer, adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of a percent. In the case of a banking institution that holds more than seven million dollars of time deposits of state moneys, the rate of interest payable on deposits in excess of seven million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(2) Beginning January 1, 2011, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution on up to five million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be the same as the average rate paid during the week next preceding the week in which the deposit was made for United States of America treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to the time of termination of the deposit, as determined by the state treasurer, adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of a percent. In the case of a banking institution that holds more than five million dollars of time deposits of state moneys, the rate of interest payable on deposits in excess of five million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(3) Beginning January 1, 2012, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution on up to three million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be the same as the average rate paid during the week next preceding the week in which the deposit was made for United States of America treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to the time of termination of the deposit, as determined by the state treasurer, adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of a percent. In the case of a banking institution that holds more than three million dollars of time deposits of state moneys, the rate of interest payable on deposits in excess of three million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(4) Beginning January 1, 2013, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution on up to one million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be the same as the average rate paid during the week next preceding the week in which the deposit was made for United States of America treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to the time of termination of the deposit, as determined by the state treasurer, adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of a percent. In the case of a banking institution that holds more than one million dollars of time deposits of state moneys, the rate of interest payable on deposits in excess of one million dollars of time deposits of state moneys shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(5) Beginning January 1, 2014, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution on all time deposits of state moneys shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section.\n\n5. Notwithstanding subdivisions (1) to (5) of subsection 4 of this section, for any new time deposits of state moneys placed after January 1, 2010, with a term longer than eighteen months, the rate of interest payable by a banking institution shall be set at the market rate as determined in subsection 6 of this section.\n\n6. Market rate shall be determined no less frequently than once a month by the director of investments in the office of state treasurer. The process for determining a market rate shall include due consideration of prevailing rates offered for certificates of deposit by well-capitalized Missouri financial institutions, the advance rate established by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines for member institutions and the costs of collateralization, as well as an evaluation of the credit risk associated with other authorized securities under Section 15, Article IV, of the Missouri Constitution, or any other calculation determined by the state treasurer based on current market investment indicators. Banking institutions may also offer a higher rate than the market rate for any time deposit placed with the state treasurer in excess of the total amount of state moneys set at the United States of America treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to the time of termination of the deposit indicated in subdivisions (1) to (5) of subsection 4 of this section.\n\n7. Within the parameters of the state treasurer's written investment policy, the state treasurer may subscribe for or purchase outright or by repurchase agreement investments of the character described in subsection 3 of this section which the treasurer, in the exercise of the treasurer's best judgment, believes to be the best for investment of state moneys at the time and in payment therefor may withdraw moneys from any bank account, demand or time, maintained by the treasurer without having any supporting warrant of the commissioner of administration. The state treasurer may bid on subscriptions for such obligations in accordance with the treasurer's best judgment. The state treasurer shall provide for the safekeeping of all such obligations so acquired in the same manner that securities pledged to secure the repayment of state moneys deposited in banking institutions are kept by the treasurer pursuant to law. The state treasurer may hold any such obligation so acquired by the treasurer until its maturity or prior thereto may sell the same outright or by reverse repurchase agreement provided the state's security interest in the underlying security is perfected or temporarily exchange such obligation for cash or other authorized securities of at least equal market value with no maturity more than one year beyond the maturity of any of the traded obligations, for a negotiated fee as the treasurer, in the exercise of the treasurer's best judgment, deems necessary or advisable for the best interest of the people of the state of Missouri in the light of the circumstances at the time prevailing. The state treasurer may pay all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the treasurer in connection with the subscription, purchase, sale, collection, safekeeping or delivery of all such obligations at any time acquired by the treasurer.\n\n8. As used in this chapter, except as more particularly specified in section 30.270, obligations of the United States shall include securities of the United States Treasury, and United States agencies or instrumentalities as described in Section 15, Article IV, Constitution of Missouri.

Lending institution receiving linked deposits, requirements and limitations — false statements as to use for loan, penalty — eligible student borrowers — eligibility, student renewal loans, repayment method — priority for reduced-rate loans. —1. An eligible lending institution that desires to receive a linked deposit shall accept and review applications for linked deposit loans from eligible multitenant enterprises, eligible farming operations, eligible alternative energy consumers, eligible alternative energy operations, eligible locally owned businesses, eligible small businesses, eligible job enhancement businesses, eligible marketing enterprises, eligible agribusinesses, eligible beginning farmers, eligible livestock operations, eligible residential property developers, eligible residential property owners, eligible governmental entities, eligible student borrowers, eligible facility borrowers, and eligible water supply systems. An eligible residential property owner shall certify on his or her loan application that the reduced rate loan will be used exclusively to purchase, develop or rehabilitate a multifamily residential property. The lending institution shall apply all usual lending standards to determine the creditworthiness of each eligible multitenant enterprise, eligible farming operation, eligible alternative energy operation, eligible alternative energy consumer, eligible locally owned business, eligible small business, eligible job enhancement business, eligible marketing enterprise, eligible residential property developer, eligible residential property owner, eligible governmental entities, eligible agribusiness, eligible beginning farmer, eligible livestock operation, eligible student borrower, eligible facility borrower, or eligible water supply system. No linked deposit loan made to any eligible multitenant development enterprise, eligible farming operation, eligible alternative energy operation, eligible alternative energy consumer, eligible locally owned business, eligible livestock operation, eligible agribusiness, eligible beginning farmer, eligible job enhancement business, eligible marketing enterprise, eligible residential property developer, eligible residential property owner, eligible governmental entity, eligible student borrower, eligible water supply system, or eligible small business shall exceed a dollar limit determined by the state treasurer in the state treasurer's best judgment, except as otherwise limited. Any link deposit loan made to an eligible facility borrower shall be in accordance with the loan amount and loan term requirements in section 30.860.\n\n2. An eligible farming operation, small business or job enhancement business shall certify on its loan application that the reduced rate loan will be used exclusively for necessary production expenses or the expenses listed in subsection 2 of section 30.753 or the refinancing of an existing loan for production expenses or the expenses listed in subsection 2 of section 30.753 of an eligible farming operation, small business or job enhancement business. Whoever knowingly makes a false statement concerning such application is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. An eligible water supply system shall certify on its loan application that the reduced rate loan shall be used exclusively to pay the costs of upgrading or repairing an existing water system, constructing a new water system, or making other capital improvements to a water system which are necessary to improve the service capacity of the system.\n\n3. In considering which eligible farming operations should receive reduced-rate loans, the eligible lending institution shall give priority to those farming operations which have suffered reduced yields due to drought or other natural disasters and for which the receipt of a reduced-rate loan will make a significant contribution to the continued operation of the recipient farming operation.\n\n4. In considering which eligible small businesses should receive reduced-rate loans, the eligible lending institution shall give priority to those small businesses that are owned by veterans.\n\n5. The eligible financial institution shall forward to the state treasurer a linked deposit loan package, in the form and manner as prescribed by the state treasurer. The package shall include such information as required by the state treasurer, including the amount of each loan requested.

The eligible lending institution shall be responsible for determining if a student borrower is an eligible student borrower. A student borrower shall be eligible for an initial or renewal reduced-rate loan only if, at the time of the application for the loan, the student is a citizen or permanent resident of the United States, a resident of the state of Missouri as defined by the coordinating board for higher education, is enrolled or has been accepted for enrollment in an eligible higher education institution, and establishes that the student has financial need. In considering which eligible student borrowers may receive reduced-rate loans, the eligible lending institution may give priority to those eligible student borrowers whose income, or whose family income, if the eligible student borrower is a dependent, is such that the eligible student borrower does not qualify for need-based student financial aid pursuant to 20 U.S.C. Section 1078, as amended (the Higher Education Amendments of 1986). The eligible lending institution shall require the eligible student borrower to document that the student has applied for and has obtained all need-based student financial aid for which the student is eligible prior to application for a reduced-rate loan pursuant to this section. In no case shall the combination of all financial aid awarded to any student in any particular enrollment period exceed the total cost of attendance at the institution in which the student is enrolled. No eligible lending institution shall charge any additional fees, including but not limited to an origination, service or insurance fee on any loan agreement under the provisions of sections 30.750 to 30.765.\n\n7. The eligible lending institution making an initial loan to an eligible student borrower may make a renewal loan or loans to the student. The total of such reduced-rate loans from eligible lending institutions made pursuant to this section to any individual student shall not exceed the cumulative totals established by 20 U.S.C. Section 1078, as amended. An eligible student borrower shall certify on his or her loan application that the reduced-rate loan shall be used exclusively to pay the costs of tuition, incidental fees, books and academic supplies, room and board and other fees directly related to enrollment in an eligible higher education institution. The eligible lending institution shall make the loan payable to the eligible student borrower and the eligible higher education institution as co-payees. The method of repayment of the loan shall be the same as for repayment of loans made pursuant to sections 173.095 to 173.186.\n\n8.
