Nothing in this chapter shall be construed by the courts of this state in a manner inconsistent with Article II of the Constitution of Missouri.\n\n16. The auditor shall be responsible for receiving reports of allegations of improper governmental activities as provided in section 29.221.

The state auditor shall audit any political subdivision of the state, including counties having a county auditor, if requested to do so by a petition submitted by a person who resides or owns real property within the boundaries or area of service of the political subdivision and such petition is submitted to the state auditor within one year from requesting the petition from the state auditor and is signed by the requisite percent of the qualified voters of the political subdivision. The requisite percent of qualified voters to cause such an audit to be conducted shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) If the number of qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition is less than one thousand, twenty-five percent of the qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the registered voters eligible to vote at the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition;\n\n(2) If the number of qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition is one thousand or more but less than five thousand, fifteen percent of the qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition, provided that the number of qualified voters signing such petition is not less than two hundred;\n\n(3) If the number of qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition is five thousand or more but less than fifty thousand, ten percent of the qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition, provided that the number of qualified voters signing such petition is not less than seven hundred fifty;\n\n(4) If the number of qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition is fifty thousand or more, five percent of the qualified voters of the political subdivision determined on the basis of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition, provided that the number of qualified voters signing such petition is not less than five thousand.\n\n3.
