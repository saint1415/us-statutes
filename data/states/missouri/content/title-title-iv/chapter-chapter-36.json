The pay plan shall include, for each class of positions, a minimum and a maximum rate, and such provision for intermediate rates as the director considers necessary or equitable. The pay plan may also provide for the use of open, or stepless, pay ranges. The pay plan may include provision for grouping of positions with similar levels of responsibility or expertise into broad classification bands for purposes of determining compensation and for such salary differentials and other pay structures as the director considers necessary or equitable. In establishing the rates, the director shall give consideration to the experience in recruiting for positions in the state service, the rates of pay prevailing in the state for the services performed, and for comparable services in public and private employment, living costs, maintenance, or other benefits received by employees, and the financial condition and policies of the state.
