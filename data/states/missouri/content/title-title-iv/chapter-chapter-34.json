The commissioner of administration, in consultation with the environmental improvement and energy resources authority of the department of natural resources, shall give full consideration to the purchase of products made from materials recovered from solid waste and to the reduction and ultimate elimination of purchases of products manufactured in whole or in part of thermoformed or other extruded polystyrene foam manufactured using any fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Products that utilize recovered materials of a price and quality comparable to products made from virgin materials shall be sought and purchased, with particular emphasis on recycled oil, retread tires, compost materials and recycled paper products. The commissioner shall exercise a preference for such products if their use is technically feasible and, where a bid is required, their price is equal to, or less than, the price of items which are manufactured or produced from virgin materials. Products that would be inferior, violate safety standards or violate product warranties if the provisions of this section are followed may be excluded from the provisions of this section.\n\n2. The commissioner of administration shall:\n\n(1) Review the procurement specifications in order to eliminate discrimination against the procurement of recycled products;\n\n(2) Review and modify the contract specifications for paper products and increase the minimum required percentage of recycled paper in each product as follows:\n\n(a) Forty percent recovered materials for newsprint;\n\n(b) Eighty percent recovered materials for paperboard;\n\n(c) Fifty percent waste paper in high grade printing and writing paper;\n\n(d) Five to forty percent in tissue products;\n\n(3) Support federal incentives and policy guidelines designed to promote these goals;\n\n(4) Develop and implement a cooperative procurement policy to facilitate bulk order purchases and to increase availability of recycled products.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no state agency may purchase any food or beverage containers or wrapping manufactured from any polystyrene foam manufactured using any fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be an ozone-depleting chemical.\n\n4. No state agency may purchase any items made in whole or part of thermoformed or other extruded polystyrene foam manufactured using any fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be an ozone-depleting chemical without approval from the commissioner of administration. Approval shall not be granted unless the purchasing agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director of the department of natural resources and the commissioner that there is no environmentally more acceptable alternatives or the quality of such alternatives is not adequate for the purpose intended.\n\n5. For each paper product type and corresponding recycled paper content standard pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section, attainment goals for the percentage of paper products to be purchased that utilize post-consumer recovered materials shall be:\n\n(1) Ten percent in 1991 and 1992;\n\n(2) Twenty-five percent in 1993 and 1994;\n\n(3) Forty percent in 1995; and\n\n(4) Sixty percent by 2000.\n\n6.

All purchases in excess of ten thousand dollars shall be based on competitive bids, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\n\n2. On any purchase where the estimated expenditure shall be one hundred thousand dollars or over, except as provided in subsection 6 of this section, the commissioner of administration shall:\n\n(1) Advertise for bids in at least two daily newspapers of general circulation in such places as are most likely to reach prospective bidders and may advertise in at least two weekly minority newspapers and may provide such information through an electronic medium available to the general public at least five days before bids for such purchases are to be opened. Other methods of advertisement, which may include minority business purchase councils, however, may be adopted by the commissioner of administration when such other methods are deemed more advantageous for the supplies to be purchased;\n\n(2) Post a notice of the proposed purchase in his or her office; and\n\n(3) Solicit bids by mail or other reasonable method generally available to the public from prospective suppliers. All bids for such supplies shall be mailed or delivered to the office of the commissioner of administration so as to reach such office before the time set for opening bids.\n\n3. The contract shall be let to the lowest and best bidder. The commissioner of administration shall have the right to reject any or all bids and advertise for new bids, or purchase the required supplies on the open market if they can be so purchased at a better price. When bids received pursuant to this section are unreasonable or unacceptable as to terms and conditions, noncompetitive, or the low bid exceeds available funds and it is determined in writing by the commissioner of administration that time or other circumstances will not permit the delay required to resolicit competitive bids, a contract may be negotiated pursuant to this section, provided that each responsible bidder who submitted such bid under the original solicitation is notified of the determination and is given a reasonable opportunity to modify their bid and submit a best and final bid to the state. In cases where the bids received are noncompetitive or the low bid exceeds available funds, the negotiated price shall be lower than the lowest rejected bid of any responsible bidder under the original solicitation.\n\n4.

The department shall follow bidding procedures pursuant to this section and may promulgate rules necessary to establish such procedures. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 1999, shall be invalid and void.\n\n7.
