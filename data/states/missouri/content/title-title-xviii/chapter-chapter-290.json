For purposes of this subdivision,\"holiday\"shall include each of the following:\n\n(a) January first;\n\n(b) The last Monday in May;\n\n(c) July fourth;\n\n(d) The first Monday in September;\n\n(e) November eleventh;\n\n(f) The fourth Thursday in November; and\n\n(g) December twenty-fifth;\n\n­­If any holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered a holiday.\n\n(3) For all overtime work performed, not less than one and one-half the prevailing hourly rate of wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the work is performed or the public works contracting minimum wage, whichever is applicable, shall be paid to all workers employed by or on behalf of any public body engaged in the construction of public works, exclusive of maintenance work or contractual obligation. For purposes of this subdivision,\"overtime work\"shall include work that exceeds ten hours in one day and work in excess of forty hours in one calendar week; and\n\n(4) A thirty-minute lunch period on each calendar day shall be allowed for each worker on a public works project, provided that such time shall not be considered as time worked.\n\n2. Only workers that are directly employed by contractors or subcontractors in actual construction work on the site of the building or construction job shall be deemed to be employed upon public works.\n\n3. Any worker who agrees in writing to volunteer his or her labor without pay shall not be deemed to be employed upon public works, and shall not be entitled to the wage rates required pursuant to sections 290.210 to 290.340. For the purposes of this section, the term\"worker who agrees in writing to volunteer his or her labor without pay\"shall mean a worker who volunteers his or her labor without any promise of benefit or remuneration for such voluntary activity, and who is not a prisoner in any jail or prison facility and who is not performing community service pursuant to disposition of a criminal case against him or her, and is not otherwise employed for compensation at any time in the construction or maintenance work on the same public works for which the worker is a volunteer. Under no circumstances may an employer or a public body force, compel or otherwise intimidate a worker into performing work otherwise paid at a prevailing wage rate or at a public works contracting minimum wage rate as a volunteer.\n\n4. When the hauling of materials or equipment includes some phase of construction other than the mere transportation to the site of the construction, workers engaged in this dual capacity shall be deemed employed directly on public works.\n\n5. (1) The provisions of sections 290.210 to 290.340 shall not apply to the construction of public works for which either the engineer's estimate or the bid accepted by the public body for the total project cost is in the amount of seventy-five thousand dollars or less.\n\n(2) The total project cost shall be based upon the entire project and not individual projects within a larger project.\n\n(3) The total project cost shall include the value of work performed on the project by every person paid by a contractor or subcontractor for that person's work on the project. The total project cost shall additionally include all materials and supplies purchased for the project.\n\n6. A public body shall not divide a project into multiple contracts for the purpose of lowering the total project cost below the threshold described in subsection 5 of this section.\n\n7. For any public works project for which either the engineer's estimate or the bid accepted by the public body for the total project cost is in the amount of seventy-five thousand dollars or less that becomes subject to a change order that increases the total project cost in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars, the provisions of sections 290.210 to 290.340 shall apply only to that portion of the project that was in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for the purposes of construction of public works for which either the engineer's estimate or the bid accepted by the public body for the total project cost is in the amount of ten thousand dollars or less for all occupational titles, public bodies shall be exempt from any law requiring the use of competitive bids.\n\n(L. 1957 p. 574 § 3, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1594, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1729, et al.)",

Applicable wage rates, incorporation into contracts — failure to pay, penalty — complaints of violation, public body or prime contractor to withhold payment — determination of a violation, investigation required — employer's right to dispute — enforcement proceeding permitted, when. —1. Every public body authorized to contract for or construct public works before advertising for bids or undertaking such construction shall request the department to determine the applicable wage rates in the locality where the work is to be performed. The department shall determine the applicable wage rates in the locality in which the work is to be performed as provided in section 290.257. Such determination or schedule of the wage rates shall be attached to and made a part of the specifications for the work. The public body shall then specify in the resolution or ordinance and in the call for bids for the contract the wage rates in the locality needed to execute the contract. The contractor to whom the contract is awarded and any subcontractor under the contractor shall pay not less than the specified wage rates to all workers employed by them in the execution of the contract. The public body awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than the specified wage rates shall be paid to all workers performing work under the contract. The contractor shall forfeit as a penalty to the public body on whose behalf the contract is made or awarded one hundred dollars for each worker employed, for each calendar day, or portion thereof, such worker is paid less than the specified wage rates for any work done under the contract, by the contractor or by any subcontractor under the contractor, and the public body awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to this effect. The public body awarding the contract, and its agents and officers, shall take cognizance of all complaints of all violations of the provisions of sections 290.210 to 290.340 committed in the course of the execution of the contract, and, when making payments to the contractor becoming due under the contract, shall withhold and retain therefrom all sums and amounts due and owing as a result of any violation of sections 290.210 to 290.340. Any contractor may withhold from any subcontractor sufficient sums to cover any penalties withheld by the awarding public body on account of the subcontractor's failure to comply with the terms of sections 290.210 to 290.340, and if payment has already been made, the contractor may recover from the subcontractor the amount of the penalty in a suit at law.\n\n2. In determining whether a violation of sections 290.210 to 290.340 has occurred, and whether a penalty shall be imposed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the department shall investigate any complaint made by an interested party listed under section 290.240. Upon completing such investigation, the department shall notify the employer of its findings. If the department concludes that a violation of sections 290.210 to 290.340 has occurred and a penalty may be due, the department shall notify the employer of such finding by providing a notice of penalty to the employer. Such penalty shall not be due until forty-five days after the date of the notice of the penalty.\n\n3. The employer shall have the right to dispute such notice of penalty in writing to the department within forty-five days of the date of the notice. Upon receipt of this written notice of dispute, the department shall notify the employer of the right to resolve such dispute through arbitration. The state and the employer shall submit to an arbitration process to be established by the department by rule, and in conformance with the guidelines and rules of the American Arbitration Association or other arbitration process mutually agreed upon by the employer and the state. If at any time prior to the department pursuing an enforcement action to enforce the monetary penalty provisions of subsection 1 of this section against the employer, the employer pays the back wages as determined by either the department or the arbitrator, the department shall be precluded from initiating any enforcement action to impose the monetary penalty provisions of subsection 1 of this section.\n\n4. If the employer fails to pay all wages due as determined by the arbitrator within forty-five days following the conclusion of the arbitration process, or if the employer fails to exercise the right to seek arbitration, the department may then pursue an enforcement action to enforce the monetary penalty provisions of subsection 1 of this section against the employer. If the court orders payment of the penalties as prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, the department shall be entitled to recover its actual cost of enforcement from such penalty amount.\n\n5.
