(1) Any employer required to report under subsection 1 of section 292.605, except local governments and family-owned farm operations, shall submit an annual fee to the commission of one hundred dollars along with the Tier II form. Owners or operators of petroleum retail facilities shall pay a fee of no more than fifty dollars for each such facility. Any person, firm or corporation selling, delivering or transporting petroleum or petroleum products and whose primary business deals with petroleum products or who is covered by the provisions of chapter 323, if such person, firm or corporation is paying fees under the provisions of the federal hazardous materials transportation registration and fee assessment program, shall deduct such federal fees from those fees owed to the state under the provisions of this subsection. If the federal fees exceed or are equal to what would otherwise be owed under this subsection, such employer shall not be liable for state fees under this subsection. In relation to petroleum products\"primary business\"shall mean that the person, firm or corporation shall earn more than fifty percent of hazardous chemical revenues from the sale, delivery or transport of petroleum products.

A late fee of ten percent of the total owed, plus one percent per month of the total, may be assessed by the commission.\n\n(4) If, on March first of each year, fees collected under this section and natural resources damages made available pursuant to section 640.235 exceed one million dollars, any excess over one million dollars shall be proportionately credited to fees payable in the succeeding year by each employer who was required to pay a fee and who did pay a fee in the year in which the excess occurred. The limit of one million dollars contained herein shall be reviewed by the commission concurrent with the review of fees as required in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. Beginning January 1, 2013, any employer filing its Tier II form pursuant to subsection 1 of section 292.605 may request that the commission distribute that employer's Tier II report to the local emergency planning committees and fire departments listed in its Tier II report. Any employer opting to have the commission distribute its Tier II report shall pay an additional fee of ten dollars for each facility listed in the report at the time of filing to recoup the commission's distribution costs.
