Labor relations affecting public utilities — state policy. —It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state that heat, light, power, sanitation, transportation, communication, and water are life essentials of the people; that the possibility of labor strife in utilities operating under governmental franchise or permit or under governmental ownership and control is a threat to the welfare and health of the people; that utilities so operating are clothed with public interest, and the state's regulation of the labor relations affecting such public utilities is necessary in the public interest.\n\n(L. 1947 V. I p. 358 § 1)\n\n(1951) Sections 295.090, 295.180 and 295.200 are severable from the remainder of this law (§§ 295.010 to 295.210) so that the constitutionality of such sections need not be determined in mandamus proceeding to compel payment of compensation of members of the state board of mediation. Remainder of law provides a complete, sensible and valid enactment consistent with the state and federal constitutions and federal labor legislation, and therefore capable of being carried into execution as intended by the legislature. State ex rel. State Board of Mediation v. Pigg, 362 Mo. 798, 244 S.W.2d 75.\n\n(1958) Where, under city charter, whole matter of qualifications, tenure, compensation and working conditions in city's public utilities involves exercise of city's legislative powers so that these matters are not subject to contract, the King-Thompson Act has no application. Glidewell v. Hughey (Mo.), 314 S.W.2d 749.\n\n(1958) Sections 295.010 to 295.080, 295.120 to 295.180 and subdivisions (1) and (6) of § 295.200 held valid against attacks based on contentions they violated various provisions of the state and federal constitutions.
