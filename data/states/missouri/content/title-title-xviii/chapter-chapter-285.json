An employer shall not be liable for injuries to passengers and other persons resulting from the operation or use of a motor vehicle, not owned, leased or contracted for by the employer, in a ride-sharing arrangement.\n\n4.

Transient employers, defined, bonding requirements — exceptions — specific requirements — penalties — records to be kept, how — discontinuance in activity, notice to director of revenue — inapplicability to certain out-of-state businesses. —1. As used in this section,\"transient employer\"means an employer as defined in sections 143.191, 287.030, and 288.032 making payment of wages taxable under chapters 143, 287, and 288 who is not domiciled in this state and who temporarily transacts any business within the state, but shall not include any employer who is not subject to Missouri income tax because of the provisions of 15 U.S.C. Section 381. The transaction of business shall be considered temporary at any time it cannot be reasonably expected to continue for a period of twenty-four consecutive months. Professional athletic teams and professional entertainers domiciled in a state other than Missouri shall be deemed a\"transient employer\"for the purposes of this section, unless the person or entity who pays compensation to the nonresident entertainer has fully complied with the provisions of section 143.183 in which case the nonresident entertainer shall not be considered a transient employer.\n\n2. Employers meeting the following criteria shall not be required to file a financial assurance instrument as required by this section:\n\n(1) The principal place of business of the employer must be in a county of another state which is contiguous to the state of Missouri; and\n\n(2) The employer must have been under contract to perform work in Missouri for at least sixty days cumulatively out of twelve months during each of the two calendar years immediately preceding the employer's initial application for exemption from the provisions of this section; and\n\n(3) The employer must have in his possession a tax clearance from the department of revenue and the division of employment security stating that the employer has faithfully complied with the tax laws of this state during the period set out in subdivision (2) of this subsection.­­Within ninety days of August 13, 1988, such employers must obtain initial tax clearances in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. Any tax clearance issued under the provisions of this section by the division of employment security shall be submitted to the department of revenue. On or before January thirty-first of each year, except January thirty-first following the year during which the employer first meets these criteria, the employer shall submit application to the department of revenue and division of employment security for a renewed tax clearance. Failure to submit such renewal applications or failure to comply with applicable Missouri taxing and employment security laws during the period between annual renewal dates or removal of the employer's principal place of business from a county in another state which is contiguous to Missouri to a state other than Missouri shall immediately subject the employer to all provisions of this section. An employer meeting the requirements of this subsection shall still be subject to the provisions of subsection 5 of this section.\n\n­­Within ninety days of August 13, 1988, such employers must obtain initial tax clearances in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. Any tax clearance issued under the provisions of this section by the division of employment security shall be submitted to the department of revenue. On or before January thirty-first of each year, except January thirty-first following the year during which the employer first meets these criteria, the employer shall submit application to the department of revenue and division of employment security for a renewed tax clearance. Failure to submit such renewal applications or failure to comply with applicable Missouri taxing and employment security laws during the period between annual renewal dates or removal of the employer's principal place of business from a county in another state which is contiguous to Missouri to a state other than Missouri shall immediately subject the employer to all provisions of this section. An employer meeting the requirements of this subsection shall still be subject to the provisions of subsection 5 of this section.\n\n3. Every transient employer shall file with the director of revenue a financial assurance instrument including, but not limited to, a cash bond, a surety bond, or an irrevocable letter of credit as defined in section 400.5-103 issued by any state or federal financial institution. The financial assurance instrument shall be in an amount not less than the average estimated quarterly withholding tax liability of the applicant, but in no case less than five thousand dollars nor more than twenty-five thousand dollars. Any corporate surety shall be licensed to do such business in this state and approved by the director of revenue to act as a surety. The transient employer shall be the principal obligor and the state of Missouri shall be the obligee. The financial assurance instrument shall be conditioned upon the prompt filing of true reports and the payment by such employer to the director of revenue of any and all withholding taxes which are now or which hereafter may be levied or imposed by the state of Missouri, upon the employer, together with any and all penalties and interest thereon, and generally upon the faithful compliance with the provisions of chapters 143, 287, and 288.\n\n4. Any transient employer who is already otherwise required to file a financial assurance instrument as a condition of any contract, provided said financial assurance instrument guarantees payment of all applicable state taxes and all withholding taxes levied or imposed by the state and provided that such financial assurance instrument is delivered by certified mail to the department of revenue by the applicable awarding entity at least fourteen days before the execution of the contract for the performance of work, may use the same financial assurance instrument to comply with the provisions of this section. Before such financial assurance instrument is approved by the awarding entity, the director of revenue shall be satisfied that such financial assurance instrument is sufficient to cover all taxes imposed by this state and the director shall so notify the awarding entity of the decision within the fourteen days prior to the execution of the contract. Failure to do so by the director shall waive any right to disapprove such financial assurance instrument. Before a financial assurance instrument is released by the entity awarding the contract, a tax clearance shall be obtained from the director of revenue that such transient employer has faithfully complied with all the tax laws of this state.\n\n5. Every transient employer shall certify to the director of revenue that such employer has sufficient workers' compensation insurance either through a self-insurance program or a policy of workers' compensation insurance issued by an approved workers' compensation carrier. The self-insurance program shall be approved by the division of workers' compensation pursuant to section 287.280. The insurance policy shall be in a contract form approved by the department of commerce and insurance.\n\n6. In the event that liability upon the financial assurance instrument thus filed by the transient employer shall be discharged or reduced, whether by judgment rendered, payment made or otherwise, or if in the opinion of the director of revenue any surety on a bond theretofore given or financial institution shall have become unsatisfactory or unacceptable, then the director of revenue may require the employer to file a new financial assurance instrument in the same form and amount. If such new financial assurance instrument shall be furnished by such employer as above provided, the director of revenue shall upon satisfaction of any liability that has accrued, release the surety on the old bond or financial institution issuing the irrevocable letter of credit.\n\n7. Any surety on any bond or financial institution issuing an irrevocable letter of credit furnished by any transient employer as provided in this section shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to the state of Missouri accruing on such bond or irrevocable letter of credit after the expiration of sixty days from the date upon which such surety or financial institution shall have lodged with the director of revenue a written request to be released and discharged; but the request shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge such surety or financial institution from any liability already accrued or which shall accrue during and before the expiration of said sixty-day period. The director of revenue shall promptly on receipt of notice of such request notify the employer who furnished such bond or irrevocable letter of credit and such employer shall on or before the expiration of such sixty-day period file with the director of revenue a new financial assurance instrument satisfactory to the director of revenue in the amount and form provided in this section.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the limitation as to the amount of any financial assurance instrument fixed by this section, if a transient employer becomes delinquent in the payment of any tax or tenders a check in payment of tax which check is returned unpaid because of insufficient funds, the director may demand an additional instrument of such employer in an amount necessary, in the judgment of the director, to protect the revenue of the state. The penal sum of the additional instrument and the instrument furnished under the provisions of the law requiring such instrument may not exceed two quarters' estimated tax liability.\n\n9. For any period when a transient employer fails to meet the requirements of this section, there shall be added to any deficiency assessed against a transient employer, in addition to any other addition, interest, and penalties, an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the deficiency.\n\n10. A taxpayer commits the crime of failure to file a financial assurance instrument if he knowingly fails to comply with the provisions of this section.\n\n11. Failure to file a financial assurance instrument is a class A misdemeanor. Pursuant to section 560.021*, a corporation found guilty of failing to file a financial assurance instrument may be fined up to five thousand dollars or any higher amount not exceeding twice the amount the employer profited from the commission of the offense.\n\n12. Failing to register with the department of revenue and execute the financial assurance instrument herein provided, prior to beginning the performance of any contract, shall prohibit the employer from performing on such contract until he complies with such requirements.\n\n13. Each employer shall keep full and accurate records clearly indicating the names, occupations, and crafts, if applicable, of every person employed by him together with an accurate record of the number of hours worked by each employee and the actual wages paid. The payroll records required to be so kept shall be open to inspection by any authorized representative of the department of revenue at any reasonable time and as often as may be necessary and such records shall not be destroyed or removed from the state for a period of one year following the completion of the contract in connection with which the records are made.\n\n14. The entering into of any contract for the performance of work in the state of Missouri by any such employer shall be deemed to constitute an appointment of the secretary of state as registered agent of such employer for purposes of accepting service of any process, or of any notice or demand required or permitted by law. The service of any such process, notice or demand, when served on the secretary of state shall have the same legal force and validity as if served upon the employer personally within the state.\n\n15. In addition, any employer who fails to file a financial assurance instrument as required by this section shall be prohibited from contracting for or performing labor on any public works project in this state for a period of one year.\n\n16. Whenever a transient employer ceases to engage in activity within the state it shall be the duty of such transient employer to notify the director of revenue in writing at least ten days prior to the time the discontinuance takes effect.\n\n17. The provisions of this section shall not apply to out-of-state businesses operating under sections 190.270 to 190.285.\n\n(L. 1988 S.B. 488 § 1, A.L. 1994 S.B. 477, et al., A.L. 1997 H.B. 472, A.L. 1998 S.B. 724, A.L. 2008 S.B. 788, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1190)\n\n*Section 560.021 was repealed by S.B. 491, 2014, effective 1-01-17.",

Subject to the provisions of section 285.230, any county, city, town, village or any other political subdivision which requires a building permit for a person to perform certain construction projects shall require a transient employer to show proof that the employer has been issued a tax clearance and has filed a financial assurance instrument as required by section 285.230 before such entity issues a building permit to the transient employer. If any transient employer obtains a building permit without providing such proof, provides a fraudulently obtained tax clearance or a fraudulent financial assurance instrument or through any misrepresentation or any other fraudulent act or in any way violates the provisions of sections 285.230 to 285.234, the Missouri department of revenue shall request a temporary restraining order or seek injunctive relief to immediately prohibit further performance of work by the transient employer on such contract or project. The court may direct that any payments due such transient employer be equitably distributed in satisfaction of the transient employer's obligations pursuant to sections 285.230 to 285.234. Upon issuance of such order by a court of competent jurisdiction, the person for whom the work is being performed may engage another contractor as provided by law or any provision of contract and the person shall not be deemed to be in violation of the contract with such transient employer removed by the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create or constitute a liability to or a cause of action against a city or county in regard to the issuance of any license pursuant to this section.\n\n2. Any contractor for private or public construction work in this state which contracts with or otherwise engages a subcontractor, which is deemed a transient employer as defined in section 285.230, to perform any portion of such work, shall require such subcontractor to show proof of having filed a financial assurance instrument with the director of revenue as required by section 285.230 and to show proof that the subcontractor holds a current valid certificate of insurance for workers' compensation coverage in this state, prior to the subcontractor performing any work on the project. If the subcontractor is self-insured for purposes of workers' compensation, the contractor shall require proof that such self-insurance by the subcontractor has been approved by the division of workers' compensation. The contractor shall not allow the subcontractor to perform on such contract until proof of compliance as required by this section has been provided to the contractor. If a subcontractor which is deemed to be a transient employer has previously submitted proof of compliance as required by this section to a state agency or political subdivision for which the contract is being performed as a condition of being qualified to perform work for such agency or political subdivision, the general contractor shall not be required to obtain the proofs required by this section. If at any time prior to final payment to a subcontractor for work performed on a project, a contractor is notified in writing by the director of revenue or the director of the division of workers' compensation that a subcontractor is in violation of sections 285.230 to 285.234, the contractor shall withhold all or part of any payment to the subcontractor under the contract for payment in satisfaction of the subcontractor's obligations as a transient employer if so directed by the director of revenue or the director of the division of workers' compensation.

Attorney general to enforce — action to be initiated, when — complaint procedures — verification of status required — violations, corrective actions, penalties. —1. The attorney general shall enforce the requirements of sections 285.525 to 285.550.\n\n2. An enforcement action shall be initiated by means of a written, signed complaint under penalty of perjury as defined in section 575.040 to the attorney general submitted by any state official, business entity, or state resident. A valid complaint shall include an allegation which describes the alleged violator as well as the actions constituting the violation, and the date and location where such actions occurred. A complaint which alleges a violation solely or primarily on the basis of national origin, ethnicity, or race shall be deemed invalid and shall not be enforced.\n\n3. Upon receipt of a valid complaint, the attorney general shall, within fifteen business days, request identity information from the business entity regarding any persons alleged to be unauthorized aliens. Such request shall be made by certified mail. The attorney general shall direct the applicable municipal or county governing body to suspend any applicable license, permit, or exemptions of any business entity which fails, within fifteen business days after receipt of the request, to provide such information.\n\n4. The attorney general, after receiving the requested identity information from the business entity, shall submit identity data required by the federal government to verify, under 8 U.S.C. 1373, the immigration status of such persons, and shall provide the business entity with written notice of the results of the verification request:\n\n(1) If the federal government notifies the attorney general that an employee is authorized to work in the United States, the attorney general shall take no further action on the complaint;\n\n(2) If the federal government notifies the attorney general that an employee is not authorized to work in the United States, the attorney general shall proceed on the complaint as provided in subsection 5 of this section;\n\n(3) If the federal government notifies the attorney general that it is unable to verify whether an employee is authorized to work in the United States, the attorney general shall take no further action on the complaint until a verification from the federal government concerning the status of the individual is received. At no point shall any state official attempt to make an independent determination of any alien's legal status without verification from the federal government.\n\n5. (1) If the federal government notifies the attorney general that an employee is not authorized to work in the United States, and the employer of the unauthorized alien participates in a federal work authorization program, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the employer has met the requirements for an affirmative defense under subsection 4 of section 285.530, and the employer shall comply with subsection 6 of this section.\n\n(2) If the federal government notifies the attorney general that an employee is not authorized to work in the United States, the attorney general shall bring a civil action in Cole County if the attorney general reasonably believes the business entity knowingly violated subsection 1 of section 285.530:\n\n(a) If the court finds that a business entity did not knowingly violate subsection 1 of section 285.530, the employer shall have fifteen business days to comply with subdivision (1) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (2) of subsection 6 of this section. If the entity fails to do so, the court shall direct the applicable municipal or county governing body to suspend the business permit, if such exists, and any applicable licenses or exemptions of the entity until the entity complies with subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(b) If the court finds that a business entity knowingly violated subsection 1 of section 285.530, the court shall direct the applicable municipal or county governing body to suspend the business permit, if such exists, and any applicable licenses or exemptions of such business entity for fourteen days. Permits, licenses, and exemptions shall be reinstated for entities who comply with subsection 6 of this section at the end of the fourteen-day period.\n\n6. The correction of a violation with respect to the employment of an unauthorized alien shall include the following actions:\n\n(1) (a) The business entity terminates the unauthorized alien's employment. If the business entity attempts to terminate the unauthorized alien's employment and such termination is challenged in a court of the state of Missouri, the fifteen-business-day period for providing information to the attorney general referenced in subsection 3 of this section shall be tolled while the business entity pursues the termination of the unauthorized alien's employment in such forum; or\n\n(b) The business entity, after acquiring additional information from the employee, requests a secondary or additional verification by the federal government of the employee's authorization, under the procedures of a federal work authorization program. While this verification is pending, the fifteen-business-day period for providing information to the attorney general referenced in subsection 3 of this section shall be tolled; and\n\n(2) A legal representative of the business entity submits, at an office designated by the attorney general, the following:\n\n(a) A sworn affidavit stating that the violation has ended that shall include a description of the specific measures and actions taken by the business entity to end the violation, and the name, address, and other adequate identifying information for any unauthorized aliens related to the complaint; and\n\n(b) Documentation acceptable to the attorney general which confirms that the business entity has enrolled in and is participating in a federal work authorization program.\n\n7. The suspension of a business license or licenses under subsection 5 of this section shall terminate one business day after a legal representative of the business entity submits the affidavit and other documentation required under subsection 6 of this section following any period of restriction required under subsection 5 of this section.\n\n8. For an entity that violates subsection 1 of section 285.530 for a second time, the court shall direct the applicable municipal or county governing body to suspend, for one year, the business permit, if such exists, and any applicable license or exemptions of the business entity. For a subsequent violation, the court shall direct the applicable municipal or county governing body to forever suspend the business permit, if such exists, and any applicable license or exemptions of the business entity.\n\n9. In addition to the penalties in subsections 5 and 8 of this section:\n\n(1) Upon the first violation of subsection 1 of section 285.530 by any business entity awarded a state contract or grant or receiving a state-administered tax credit, tax abatement, or loan from the state, the business entity shall be deemed in breach of contract and the state may terminate the contract and suspend or debar the business entity from doing business with the state for a period of three years. Upon such termination, the state may withhold up to twenty-five percent of the total amount due to the business entity;\n\n(2) Upon a second or subsequent violation of subsection 1 of section 285.530 by any business entity awarded a state contract or grant or receiving a state-administered tax credit, tax abatement, or loan from the state, the business entity shall be deemed in breach of contract and the state may terminate the contract and permanently suspend or debar the business entity from doing business with the state. Upon such termination, the state may withhold up to twenty-five percent of the total amount due to the business entity.\n\n10. Sections 285.525 to 285.550 shall not be construed to deny any procedural mechanisms or legal defenses included in a federal work authorization program.\n\n11. Any business entity subject to a complaint and subsequent enforcement under sections 285.525 to 285.540, or any employee of such a business entity, may challenge the enforcement of this section with respect to such entity or employee in the courts of the state of Missouri.\n\n12. If the court finds that any complaint is frivolous in nature or finds no probable cause to believe that there has been a violation, the court shall dismiss the case. For purposes of this subsection,\"frivolous\"shall mean a complaint not shown by clear and convincing evidence to be valid. Any person who submits a frivolous complaint shall be liable for actual, compensatory, and punitive damages to the alleged violator for holding the alleged violator before the public in a false light. If the court finds that a complaint is frivolous or that there is not probable cause to believe there has been a violation, the attorney general shall issue a public report to the complainant and the alleged violator stating with particularity its reasons for dismissal of the complaint. Upon such issuance, the complaint and all materials relating to the complaint shall be a public record as defined in chapter 610.\n\n13. The determination of whether a worker is an unauthorized alien shall be made by the federal government. A determination of such status of an individual by the federal government shall create a rebuttable presumption as to that individual's status in any judicial proceedings brought under this section or section 285.530. The court may take judicial notice of any verification of an individual's status previously provided by the federal government and may request the federal government to provide automated or testimonial verification.\n\n14. Compensation, whether in money or in kind or in services, knowingly provided to any unauthorized alien shall not be allowed as a business expense deduction from any income or business taxes of this state.\n\n15. Any business entity which terminates an employee in accordance with this section shall not be liable for any claims made against the business entity under chapter 213 for the termination.\n\n(L. 2008 H.B. 1549, et al.)\n\nEffective 1-01-09",

The employee shall provide the employer with at least forty-eight hours' advance notice of the employee's intention to take leave under subsection 1 of this section, unless providing such notice is not practicable. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may not take any action against the employee if the employee, upon request of the employer and within a reasonable period after the absence, provides certification under subsection 5 of this section.\n\n5. The employer may require the employee to provide certification to the employer that the employee or the employee's family or household member is a victim of domestic or sexual violence and that the leave is for one of the purposes enumerated in subsection 1 of this section.

An employee may satisfy the certification requirement of subsection 5 of this section by providing to the employer a sworn statement of the employee and the following:\n\n(1) Documentation from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional from whom the employee or the employee's family or household member has sought assistance in addressing domestic violence or sexual violence and the effects of such violence;\n\n(2) A police or court record; or\n\n(3) Other corroborating evidence.\n\n7. All information provided to the employer pursuant to subsection 6 of this section including a statement of the employee or any other documentation, record, or corroborating evidence, and the fact that the employee has requested or obtained leave pursuant to this section, shall be retained in the strictest confidence by the employer, except to the extent that disclosure is requested or consented to in writing by the employee or otherwise required by applicable federal or state law.\n\n8. Any employee who takes leave under this section shall be entitled, on return from such leave, to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.\n\n9. The taking of leave under this section shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced. Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to the accrual of any seniority or employment benefits during any period of leave or any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an employer from requiring an employee on leave under this section to report periodically to the employer on the status and intention of the employee to return to work.\n\n10. Upon the request of an employer, an employee requesting a reasonable safety accommodation pursuant to sections 285.625 to 285.670 shall provide the employer a written statement signed by the employee or an individual acting on the employee's behalf, certifying that the reasonable safety accommodation is for a purpose authorized under sections 285.625 to 285.670.\n\n(L. 2021 H.B. 432)",

Each professional employer agreement shall include the following:\n\n(1) The allocation of rights, duties, and obligations as described in subsection 1 of this section;\n\n(2) A requirement that the PEO shall have responsibility to:\n\n(a) Pay wages to covered employees;\n\n(b) Withhold, collect, report, and remit payroll-related and unemployment taxes; and\n\n(c) To the extent the PEO has assumed responsibility in the professional employer agreement, to make payments for employee benefits for covered employees.\n\n­­As used in this section, the term\"wages\"does not include any obligation between a client and a covered employee for payments beyond or in addition to the covered employee's salary, draw, or regular rate of pay, such as bonuses, commissions, severance pay, deferred compensation, profit sharing, vacation, sick, or other paid-time off pay, unless the PEO has expressly agreed to assume liability for such payments in the professional employer agreement; and\n\n(3) A requirement that the PEO shall have a right to hire, discipline, and terminate a covered employee as may be necessary to fulfill the PEO's responsibilities under sections 285.700 to 285.750 and the professional employer agreement.

A PEO under sections 285.700 to 285.750 is not engaged in the sale of insurance or in acting as a third-party administrator by offering, marketing, selling, administering, or providing professional employer services that include services and employee benefit plans for covered employees. A client and a registered professional employer organization shall each be deemed an employer under the laws of this state for purposes of sponsoring retirement and welfare benefits plans for its covered employees. A fully insured welfare benefit plan sponsored by a registered professional employer organization for the benefit of its covered employees shall be treated for the purposes of state law as a single employer welfare benefit plan. For purposes of sponsoring welfare benefit plans for its eligible covered employees, a registered professional employer organization shall be considered the employer of all of its eligible covered employees, and all eligible covered employees of one or more clients participating in a health benefit plan sponsored by a registered professional employer organization shall be considered employees of such registered professional employer organization. The provisions of this section shall not supersede or preempt any requirements under section 375.014.\n\n6.

The responsibility to obtain workers' compensation coverage for covered employees in compliance with all applicable laws shall be specifically allocated in the professional employer agreement to either the client or the PEO.\n\n2. (1) Coverage for both the directly employed workers of a client and the covered employees of that client shall be all in the residual or all in the voluntary market with the same carrier.\n\n(2) Workers' compensation coverage for covered employees in the voluntary market may be obtained by either:\n\n(a) The client through a standard workers' compensation policy or through duly authorized self-insurance under section 287.280; or\n\n(b) The PEO through duly authorized self-insurance under section 287.280, through the type of policy referenced under the provisions of 20 CSR 500-6.800(5)(c)2 issued to the PEO by a carrier authorized to do business in this state, or through a multiple coordinated workers' compensation policy issued by a carrier authorized to do business in this state in the name of the PEO or the client.\n\n­­A PEO authorized to self-insure under section 287.280 shall report to the insurer or the appropriate state and rating authorities such client-based information as is necessary to maintain the client's experience rating.\n\n(3) Workers' compensation for covered employees in the residual market may be obtained by the client through a residual market policy or by the PEO through a multiple coordinated policy in either the name of the PEO or the client that provides to the appropriate state and rating authorities the client-based information satisfactory to maintain the client's experience rating.\n\n3. A PEO that applies for coverage or is covered through the voluntary market shall also maintain and furnish to the insurer sufficient information to permit the calculation of an experience modification factor for each client upon termination of the coemployment relationship. Information reported during the term of the coemployment relationship which is used to calculate an experience modification factor for a client prior to and upon termination of the professional employer agreement shall continue to be used in the future experience ratings of the PEO. Such information shall include:\n\n(1) The client's corporate name;\n\n(2) The client's taxpayer or employer identification number;\n\n(3) Payroll summaries and class codes applicable to each client, and, if requested by the insurer, a listing of all covered employees associated with a given client; and\n\n(4) Claims information grouped by client, and any other information maintained by or readily available to the PEO that is necessary for the calculation of an experience modification factor for each client.\n\n4. In addition to any other provision of chapter 287, any material violations of this section by a PEO is grounds for cancellation or nonrenewal of the PEO's insurance policy by the insurer. If a PEO has received notice that its workers' compensation insurance policy will be cancelled or nonrenewed, the PEO shall notify by certified mail, within ten days after the receipt of the notice, all of the clients for which there is a coemployment relationship covered under the policy to be cancelled, provided that notice shall not be required if the PEO has obtained another insurance policy from a carrier authorized to do business in this state, with an effective date that is the same as the date of cancellation or nonrenewal.\n\n5. If the coemployment relationship with a client is terminated, the client shall utilize an experience modification factor which reflects its individual experience, including, if applicable, experience incurred for covered employees under the professional employer agreement. The PEO shall provide to the client the client's information that is maintained under subsection 3 of this section within five business days of receiving notice from the client or within five business days of providing notice to the client that the coemployment relationship will terminate. The PEO shall also provide such information to any future client insurer, if requested by such client. The PEO shall notify the insurer of its intent to terminate any client relationship prior to termination when feasible. When prior notice is not feasible, the PEO shall notify its insurer within five business days following actual termination.\n\n6. Both the client and the PEO shall be considered the employer for purposes of coverage under chapter 287. The protection of the exclusive remedy provision under section 287.120 shall apply to the PEO, the client, and to all covered employees and other employees of the client irrespective of which coemployer obtains such workers' compensation coverage. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt either the client or the PEO from compliance with the provisions of chapter 287.\n\n7. A client may request the information maintained under subsection 3 of this section at any time and every PEO shall provide that information to such client within five business days of receiving such a request.\n\n8. In the case of a request for information by a third party requesting verification of a client's experience modification factor for a client in the type of policy referenced under the provisions of 20 CSR 500-6.800(5)(c)2, the PEO shall, within five business days of receipt of receiving the client's consent, provide such third party with only the information maintained by the PEO under subsection 3 of this section. If a client refuses to grant consent to a request for information under this subsection, the PEO shall notify the requesting third party that the client has refused to consent to the disclosure of the information maintained by the PEO under subsection 3 of this section.\n\n9. A client shall provide any prospective insurer with the information maintained by the PEO under subsection 3 of this section upon receiving such information from the PEO. Failure to provide a future insurer with such information shall be considered a violation of subsection 6 of section 287.128.\n\n10. (1) A client shall notify any prospective insurer of the client's previous or current relationship with a PEO. Failure to provide a future insurer with such information shall be considered a violation of subsection 6 of section 287.128.\n\n(2) This subsection shall not apply if the PEO did not provide workers' compensation coverage to a client during the coemployment relationship.\n\n11. For purposes of chapter 288, a PEO registered under sections 285.700 to 285.750 shall be treated as a lesser employing unit under section 288.032.\n\n(L. 2018 H.B. 1719)",

The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve disbursements.
