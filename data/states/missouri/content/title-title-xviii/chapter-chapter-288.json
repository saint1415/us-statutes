As a guide to the interpretation and application of this law, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state resulting in a public calamity. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state, for compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\n\n2. This law shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose to promote employment security both by increasing opportunities for jobs through the maintenance of a system of public employment offices and by providing for the payment of compensation to individuals in respect to their unemployment.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nDivision of motor carrier and railroad safety abolished, duties and functions transferred to highways and transportation commission and department of transportation, 226.008\n\n(1964) As used in this section \"fault\" is not limited to conduct of the employee which is blameworthy or worthy of censure but means also failure of volition.

For purposes of this section, the exclusions from employment in subsection 9 of section 288.034 shall be applicable to services performed in the employ of an Indian tribe.\n\n3. Benefits based on service in employment defined in this section shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service subject to this chapter. The provisions of subsection 3 of section 288.040 pertaining to services performed at an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency shall apply to services performed in an educational institution or educational service agency wholly owned and operated by an Indian tribe or tribal unit.\n\n4. (1) Indian tribes or tribal units, including subdivisions, subsidiaries, or business enterprises wholly owned by such Indian tribes, subject to this chapter shall pay contributions under the same terms and conditions as all other subject employers, unless they elect to pay into the state unemployment fund amounts equal to the amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe. An Indian tribe and all tribal units of such Indian tribe shall be jointly and severally liable for any and all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, penalties, and surcharges owed by the Indian tribe and all tribal units of such Indian tribe.\n\n(2) Indian tribes electing to make payments in lieu of contributions must make such election in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in subsection 3 of section 288.090 pertaining to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations subject to this chapter. Indian tribes will determine if reimbursement for benefits paid will be elected by the tribe as a whole, by individual tribal units, or by combinations of individual tribal units. Termination of an Indian tribe's coverage pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection shall terminate the election of such Indian tribe and any tribal units of such Indian tribe to make payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(3) Indian tribes or tribal units will be billed for the full amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe or tribal unit on the same schedule as other employing units that have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(4) Any Indian tribe or tribal unit that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, prior to the effective date of its election, to post with the division a surety bond issued by a corporate surety authorized to do business in Missouri in an amount equivalent to the contributions or payments in lieu of contributions for which the Indian tribe or tribal unit was liable in the last calendar year in which it accrued contributions or payments in lieu of contributions, or one hundred thousand dollars, whichever amount is the greater, to ensure prompt payment of contributions or payments in lieu of contributions, interest, penalties, and surcharges for which the Indian tribe or tribal unit may be, or becomes, jointly and severally liable pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(5) Failure of the Indian tribe or tribal unit to maintain the required surety bond, including the posting of an additional surety bond or a replacement surety bond within ninety days of being directed by the division, will cause services performed for such Indian tribe to not be treated as employment for purposes of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(6) The director may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under subdivision (5) of this subsection may have services performed for such tribe again included as employment for purposes of subsection 2 of this section if all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, surcharges, and interest have been paid. Upon reinstatement of coverage under this subdivision, an Indian tribe or any tribal unit may elect, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, to make payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(7) If an Indian tribe fails to maintain the required surety bond by posting an additional surety bond or a replacement surety bond within ninety days of being directed by the division, the director will immediately notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor.\n\n(8) Notices of surety bond deficiency to Indian tribes or their tribal units shall include information that failure to post an additional surety bond or a replacement surety bond within the prescribed time frame:\n\n(a) Will cause the Indian tribe to be liable for taxes under FUTA;\n\n(b) Will cause the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of employer, as provided in subsection 1 of this section, and services in the employ of the Indian tribe, as provided in subsection 2 of this section, to be excepted from employment.\n\n5. (1) Failure of the Indian tribe or tribal unit to make required payments, including assessments of interest and penalty, within ninety days of receipt of the bill will cause services performed for such Indian tribe to not be treated as employment for purposes of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(2) The director may determine that any Indian tribe that loses coverage under subdivision (1) of this subsection may have services performed for such tribe again included as employment for purposes of subsection 2 of this section if all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, surcharges, and interest have been paid.\n\n(3) If an Indian tribe fails to make payments required under this section, including assessments of interest and penalty, within ninety days of a final notice of delinquency, the director will immediately notify the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor.\n\n6. Notices of payment and reporting delinquency to Indian tribes or their tribal units shall include information that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time frame:\n\n(1) Will cause the Indian tribe to be liable for taxes under FUTA;\n\n(2) Will cause the Indian tribe to be excepted from the definition of employer, as provided in subsection 1 of this section, and services in the employ of the Indian tribe, as provided in subsection 2 of this section, to be excepted from employment.\n\n7. Extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of an Indian tribe and not reimbursed by the federal government shall be financed in their entirety by such Indian tribe.\n\n(L. 2003 S.B. 194 & 189)\n\nEffective 5-08-03",

Unless the deputy directs otherwise, a claimant shall make a minimum of three work search contacts during any week for which he or she claims benefits. No person shall be considered not available for work, pursuant to this subdivision, solely because he or she is a substitute teacher or is on jury duty. A claimant shall not be determined to be ineligible pursuant to this subdivision because of not actively and earnestly seeking work if:\n\n(a) The claimant is participating in training approved pursuant to Section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (19 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2296, as amended);\n\n(b) The claimant is temporarily unemployed through no fault of his or her own and has a definite recall date within eight weeks of his or her first day of unemployment; however, upon application of the employer responsible for the claimant's unemployment, such eight-week period may be extended not to exceed a total of sixteen weeks at the discretion of the director;\n\n(3) The claimant has reported to an office of the division as directed by the deputy, but at least once every four weeks, except that a claimant shall be exempted from the reporting requirement of this subdivision if:\n\n(a) The claimant is claiming benefits in accordance with division regulations dealing with partial or temporary total unemployment; or\n\n(b) The claimant is temporarily unemployed through no fault of his or her own and has a definite recall date within eight weeks of his or her first day of unemployment; or\n\n(c) The director of the division of employment security has determined that the claimant belongs to a group or class of workers whose opportunities for reemployment will not be enhanced by reporting, or is prevented from reporting due to emergency conditions that limit access by the general public to an office that serves the area where the claimant resides, but only during the time such circumstances exist.\n\n­­Ineligibility pursuant to this subdivision shall begin on the first day of the week which the claimant was scheduled to claim and shall end on the last day of the week preceding the week during which the claimant does report to the division's office;\n\n(4) Prior to the first week of a period of total or partial unemployment for which the claimant claims benefits he or she has been totally or partially unemployed for a waiting period of one week. No more than one waiting week will be required in any benefit year. During calendar year 2008 and each calendar year thereafter, the one-week waiting period shall become compensable once his or her remaining balance on the claim is equal to or less than the compensable amount for the waiting period. No week shall be counted as a week of total or partial unemployment for the purposes of this subsection unless it occurs within the benefit year which includes the week with respect to which the claimant claims benefits;\n\n(5) The claimant has made a claim for benefits within fourteen days from the last day of the week being claimed.

A claimant shall be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week for which the deputy finds he or she is or has been suspended by his or her most recent employer for misconduct connected with his or her work. Suspensions of four weeks or more shall be treated as discharges.\n\n3. (1) Benefits based on \"service in employment\", described in subsections 7 and 8 of section 288.034, shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to this law; except that:\n\n(a) With respect to service performed in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution, benefits shall not be paid based on such services for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between two successive academic years or terms, or during a similar period between two regular but not successive terms, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract, to any individual if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years (or terms) and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution in the second of such academic years or terms;\n\n(b) With respect to services performed in any capacity (other than instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity) for an educational institution, benefits shall not be paid on the basis of such services to any individual for any week which commences during a period between two successive academic years or terms if such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or terms and there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the second of such academic years or terms;\n\n(c) With respect to services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision, benefits shall not be paid on the basis of such services to any individual for any week which commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if such individual performed such services in the period immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess, and there is reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services immediately following such vacation period or holiday recess;\n\n(d) With respect to services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision, benefits payable on the basis of services in any such capacity shall be denied as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subdivision to any individual who performed such services at an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency, and for this purpose the term\"educational service agency\"means a governmental agency or governmental entity which is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing such services to one or more educational institutions.\n\n(2) If compensation is denied for any week pursuant to paragraph (b) or (d) of subdivision (1) of this subsection to any individual performing services at an educational institution in any capacity (other than instructional, research or principal administrative capacity), and such individual was not offered an opportunity to perform such services for the second of such academic years or terms, such individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of the compensation for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for compensation and for which compensation was denied solely by reason of paragraph (b) or (d) of subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n4. (1) A claimant shall be ineligible for waiting week credit, benefits or shared work benefits for any week for which he or she is receiving or has received remuneration exceeding his or her weekly benefit amount or shared work benefit amount in the form of:\n\n(a) Compensation for temporary partial disability pursuant to the workers' compensation law of any state or pursuant to a similar law of the United States;\n\n(b) A governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment which is based on the previous work of such claimant to the extent that such payment is provided from funds provided by a base period or chargeable employer pursuant to a plan maintained or contributed to by such employer; but, except for such payments made pursuant to the Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law), the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the services performed for such employer by the claimant after the beginning of the base period (or remuneration for such services) do not affect eligibility for or increase the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity or similar payment.\n\n(2) If the remuneration referred to in this subsection is less than the benefits which would otherwise be due, the claimant shall be entitled to receive for such week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced by the amount of such remuneration, and, if such benefit is not a multiple of one dollar, such amount shall be lowered to the next multiple of one dollar.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, if a claimant has contributed in any way to the Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the corresponding provisions of prior law, no part of the payments received pursuant to such federal law shall be deductible from the amount of benefits received pursuant to this chapter.\n\n5. A claimant shall be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week for which or a part of which he or she has received or is seeking unemployment benefits pursuant to an unemployment insurance law of another state or the United States; provided, that if it be finally determined that the claimant is not entitled to such unemployment benefits, such ineligibility shall not apply.\n\n6. (1) A claimant shall be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week for which the deputy finds that such claimant's total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute in the factory, establishment or other premises in which such claimant is or was last employed. In the event the claimant secures other employment from which he or she is separated during the existence of the labor dispute, the claimant must have obtained bona fide employment as a permanent employee for at least the major part of each of two weeks in such subsequent employment to terminate his or her ineligibility. If, in any case, separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses at separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall for the purposes of this subsection be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment or other premises. This subsection shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the deputy that:\n\n(a) The claimant is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work; and\n\n(b) The claimant does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately preceding the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute.\n\n(2)\"Stoppage of work\"as used in this subsection means a substantial diminution of the activities, production or services at the establishment, plant, factory or premises of the employing unit. This definition shall not apply to a strike where the employees in the bargaining unit who initiated the strike are participating in the strike. Such employees shall not be eligible for waiting week credit or benefits during the period when the strike is in effect, regardless of diminution, unless the employer has been found guilty of an unfair labor practice by the National Labor Relations Board or a federal court of law for an act or actions preceding or during the strike.\n\n7. On or after January 1, 1978, benefits shall not be paid to any individual on the basis of any services, substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate, for any week which commences during the period between two successive sport seasons (or similar periods) if such individual performed such services in the first of such seasons (or similar periods) and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the later of such seasons (or similar periods).\n\n8. Benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien, unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).\n\n(1) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.\n\n(2) In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, no determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of such individual's alien status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n9. A claimant shall be ineligible for waiting week credit or benefits for any week such claimant has an outstanding penalty which was assessed based upon an overpayment of benefits, as provided for in subsection 9 of section 288.380.\n\n10. The directors of the division of employment security and the division of workforce development shall submit to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the president pro tem of the senate no later than October 15, 2006, a report outlining their recommendations for how to improve work search verification and claimant reemployment activities. The recommendations shall include, but not limited to how to best utilize \"greathires.org\", and how to reduce the average duration of unemployment insurance claims. Each calendar year thereafter, the directors shall submit a report containing their recommendations on these issues by December thirty-first of each year.\n\n11.

Any employer who is found in any Missouri court or United States district court located in Missouri to have terminated, demoted, or taken an adverse employment action against a war on terror veteran due to his or her absence while deployed shall be subject to an administrative penalty in the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars. The director of the division of employment security shall take judicial notice of judgments in suits brought under the Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (38 U.S.C. 4301). Such judgments may be considered to have a res judicata effect on the director's determination.

If a claimant is at work with a detectible amount of alcohol or a controlled substance as defined in section 195.010 in the claimant's system, in violation of the employer's alcohol and controlled substance workplace policy, the claimant shall have committed misconduct connected with the claimant's work.\n\n2. A test conducted by a laboratory certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or another certifying organization so long as the certification requirements meet the minimum standards of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the laboratory's trial packet shall be included in the administrative record and considered as evidence.\n\n3. The claimant must have previously been notified of the employer's alcohol and controlled substance workplace policy by conspicuously posting the policy in the workplace, by including the policy in a written personnel policy or handbook, or by statement of such policy in a collective bargaining agreement governing employment of the employee. The policy, public posting, handbook, collective bargaining agreement or other written notice provided to the employee must state that a positive test result may result in suspension or termination of employment.\n\n4. Test results shall be admissible if the employer's policy clearly states an employee may be subject to random, preemployment, reasonable suspicion or post-accident testing. An employer may require a preemployment test for alcohol or controlled substance use as a condition of employment, and test results shall be admissible so long as the claimant was informed of the test requirement prior to taking the test. A random, preemployment, reasonable suspicion or post-accident test result, conducted under this section, which is positive for alcohol or controlled substance use shall be considered misconduct.\n\n5. The application of this section for alcohol and controlled substance testing, relating only to methods of testing, criteria for testing, chain of custody for samples or specimens and due process for employee notification procedures shall not apply in the event that the claimant is subject to the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, so long as said agreement contains methods for alcohol or controlled substance testing that meet or exceed the minimum standards established in this section. Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize any employer to test any applicant or employee for alcohol or drugs in any manner inconsistent with Missouri or United States Constitution, law, statute or regulation, including those imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n6. All specimen collection for drugs and alcohol under this chapter shall be performed in accordance with the procedures provided for by the United States Department of Transportation rules for workplace drug and alcohol testing compiled at 49 C.F.R., Part 40. Any employer that performs drug testing or specimen collection shall use chain-of-custody procedures established by regulations of the United States Department of Transportation.\"Specimen\"means tissue, fluid, or a product of the human body capable of revealing the presence of alcohol or drugs or their metabolites.\"Chain of custody\"refers to the methodology of tracking specified materials or substances for the purpose of maintaining control and accountability from initial collection to final disposition for all such materials or substances, and providing for accountability at each stage in handling, testing, and storing specimens and reporting test results.\n\n7. The employee may request that a confirmation test on the specimen be conducted.\"Confirmation test\"means a second analytical procedure used to identify the presence of a specific drug or alcohol or metabolite in a specimen, which test must be different in scientific principle from that of the initial test procedure and must be capable of providing requisite specificity, sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. In the event that a confirmation test is requested, such shall be obtained from a separate, unrelated certified laboratory and shall be at the employee's expense only if said test confirms the original, positive test results. For purposes of this section, confirmation test shall be a split specimen test.\n\n8. Use of a controlled substance as defined under section 195.010 under and in conformity with the lawful order of a healthcare practitioner, shall not be deemed to be misconduct connected with work for the purposes of this section.\n\n9. This section shall have no effect on employers who do not avail themselves of the requirements and regulations for alcohol and controlled drug testing determinations that are required to affirm misconduct connected with work findings.\n\n10. Any employer that initiates an alcohol and drug testing policy after January 1, 2005, shall ensure that at least sixty days elapse between a general one-time notice to all employees that an alcohol and drug testing workplace policy is being implemented and the effective date of the program.\n\n11.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this law, a claimant shall be disqualified for waiting week credit or benefits until after the claimant has earned wages for work insured pursuant to the unemployment compensation laws of any state equal to ten times the claimant's weekly benefit amount if the deputy finds:\n\n(1) That the claimant has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such work or to the claimant's employer. A temporary employee of a temporary help firm will be deemed to have voluntarily quit employment if the employee does not contact the temporary help firm for reassignment prior to filing for benefits. Failure to contact the temporary help firm will not be deemed a voluntary quit unless the claimant has been advised of the obligation to contact the firm upon completion of assignments and that unemployment benefits may be denied for failure to do so.\"Good cause\", for the purposes of this subdivision, shall include only that cause which would compel a reasonable employee to cease working or which would require separation from work due to illness or disability. The claimant shall not be disqualified:\n\n(a) If the deputy finds the claimant quit such work for the purpose of accepting a more remunerative job which the claimant did accept and earn some wages therein;\n\n(b) If the claimant quit temporary work to return to such claimant's regular employer; or\n\n(c) If the deputy finds the individual quit work, which would have been determined not suitable in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision (3) of this subsection, within twenty-eight calendar days of the first day worked;\n\n(d) As to initial claims filed after December 31, 1988, if the claimant presents evidence supported by competent medical proof that she was forced to leave her work because of pregnancy, notified her employer of such necessity as soon as practical under the circumstances, and returned to that employer and offered her services to that employer as soon as she was physically able to return to work, as certified by a licensed and practicing physician, but in no event later than ninety days after the termination of the pregnancy. An employee shall have been employed for at least one year with the same employer before she may be provided benefits pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph;\n\n(e) If the deputy finds that, due to the spouse's mandatory and permanent military change of station order, the claimant quit work to relocate with the spouse to a new residence from which it is impractical to commute to the place of employment and the claimant remained employed as long as was reasonable prior to the move. The claimant's spouse shall be a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who is on active duty, or a member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces who is on active National Guard or reserve duty. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to individuals who have been determined to be an insured worker as provided in subdivision (22) of subsection 1 of section 288.030;\n\n(2) That the claimant has retired pursuant to the terms of a labor agreement between the claimant's employer and a union duly elected by the employees as their official representative or in accordance with an established policy of the claimant's employer; or\n\n(3) That the claimant failed without good cause either to apply for available suitable work when so directed by a deputy of the division or designated staff of an employment office as defined in subsection 1 of section 288.030, or to accept suitable work when offered the claimant, either through the division or directly by an employer by whom the individual was formerly employed, or to return to the individual's customary self-employment, if any, when so directed by the deputy. An offer of work shall be rebuttably presumed if an employer notifies the claimant in writing of such offer by sending an acknowledgment via any form of certified mail issued by the United States Postal Service stating such offer to the claimant at the claimant's last known address. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the means by which the deputy may establish that the claimant has or has not been sufficiently notified of available work.\n\n(a) In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the division shall consider, among other factors and in addition to those enumerated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and morals, the individual's physical fitness and prior training, the individual's experience and prior earnings, the individual's length of unemployment, the individual's prospects for securing work in the individual's customary occupation, the distance of available work from the individual's residence and the individual's prospect of obtaining local work; except that, if an individual has moved from the locality in which the individual actually resided when such individual was last employed to a place where there is less probability of the individual's employment at such individual's usual type of work and which is more distant from or otherwise less accessible to the community in which the individual was last employed, work offered by the individual's most recent employer if similar to that which such individual performed in such individual's last employment and at wages, hours, and working conditions which are substantially similar to those prevailing for similar work in such community, or any work which the individual is capable of performing at the wages prevailing for such work in the locality to which the individual has moved, if not hazardous to such individual's health, safety or morals, shall be deemed suitable for the individual.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this law, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall not be denied pursuant to this law to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:\n\na. If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;\n\nb. If the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality;\n\nc. If as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.\n\n2. If a deputy finds that a claimant has been discharged for misconduct connected with the claimant's work, such claimant shall be disqualified for waiting week credit and benefits, and no benefits shall be paid nor shall the cost of any benefits be charged against any employer for any period of employment within the base period until the claimant has earned wages for work insured under the unemployment laws of this state or any other state as prescribed in this section. In addition to the disqualification for benefits pursuant to this provision the division may in the more aggravated cases of misconduct cancel all or any part of the individual's wage credits, which were established through the individual's employment by the employer who discharged such individual, according to the seriousness of the misconduct. A disqualification provided for pursuant to this subsection shall not apply to any week which occurs after the claimant has earned wages for work insured pursuant to the unemployment compensation laws of any state in an amount equal to six times the claimant's weekly benefit amount. Should a claimant be disqualified on a second or subsequent occasion within the base period or subsequent to the base period the claimant shall be required to earn wages in an amount equal to or in excess of six times the claimant's weekly benefit amount for each disqualification.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, a claimant may not be determined to be disqualified for benefits because the claimant is in training approved pursuant to Section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (19 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2296, as amended), or because the claimant left work which was not suitable employment to enter such training. For the purposes of this subsection\"suitable employment\"means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less than eighty percent of the worker's average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564, A.L. 1957 p. 531, A.L. 1975 S.B. 325, A.L. 1979 S.B. 477, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1521, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1251 & 1549, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1485, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1368, A.L. 1997 H.B. 472, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1268 & 1211, A.L. 2006 H.B. 1456, A.L. 2011 H.B. 136, A.L. 2014 S.B. 510)\n\n(1954) Where substantial evidence supported finding that truck driver was discharged for drinking while on duty in violation of employer's rule and union contract, his disqualification for benefits was proper. Ritch v. Industrial Comm. (A.), 271 S.W.2d 791.\n\n(1958) Offer of employment by former employer must be communicated to claimant so that where former employee who moved to new address and so did not receive letter offering him work would not be disqualified for failing to accept such work.

Overruled (Mo.), 320 S.W.2d 484 (1959) where it was held that since claimant's own neglect or voluntary action prevented communication of offer and effected a breach of his contract, he was ineligible for benefits.\n\n(1959) Word \"attributable\" as used in the statute as to the cause of leaving work requires a causal connection between the leaving and the work of claimant. Bussmann Mfg. Co. v. Industrial Comm. of Mo., 327 S.W.2d 487.\n\n(1960) Claimant who left her work with appellant solely because of pregnancy, and on being ready to return to work approximately two and one-half months after baby's birth, was told there was no work available, was not entitled to unemployment compensation as she had left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to her or to her employer. Bussmann Mfg. Co. v. Industrial Commission (A.), 335 S.W.2d 456.\n\n(1960) Where a moving picture projectionist acted as a substitute for the regular projectionist and worked one day a week for several months and finally ceased working because the regular projectionist decided to work full time, the substitute was deemed to have voluntarily left his employment without good cause attributable to his work or employer since the employer had nothing to do with the arrangement between the regular projectionist and the substitute. Kilgore v Industrial Commission (A.), 337 S.W.2d 91.\n\n(1964) Where claimant, who was granted year's leave of absence due to pregnancy and was at first denied permission to return to work but was later allowed to return to work prior to expiration of leave, filed claim for benefits after having made five applications for work with other employers, commission's decision disqualifying claimant was proper. Neely v. Industrial Comm. of Mo., Div. of Emp. Sec. (A.), 379 S.W.2d 201.\n\n(1968) Held lack of cordiality of supervisor not good cause for quitting employment. Citizens Bank of Shelbyville v. Industrial Commission (A.), 428 S.W.2d 895.\n\n(1973) Even though claimant received compensation at the approximate rate of $3.54 per hour at the time of her termination, her refusal to accept work at anything less than $3.23 per hour when offered $2.50 per hour justified the determination that she was ineligible for unemployment benefits on the grounds she was unavailable for work. Blackman v. Industrial Commission, Div. of Emp. Sec. (A.), 491 S.W.2d 18.\n\n(1976) Termination of employee for refusal to shave beard held not termination because of misconduct connected with work so as to disqualify employee from waiting week credit or benefits as provided in this section, where evidence was that employee had been assured by his immediate supervisor that employer's rule against beards did not apply to him, that employee had worn beard without question of a rule violation for over a year while receiving satisfactory ratings and a wage increase, and that employee had not acted in wanton or willful disregard of his employer's interest. Laswell v. Industrial Com'n. of Missouri, etc. (A.),534 S.W.2d 613.\n\n(1977) Refusal to accept transfer to another job with forty-four percent reduction in pay would not disqualify claimant for unemployment benefits. Armco Steel Corp. v. Labor and Indus.

Sain v.

Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (Mo. banc), 688 S.W.2d 344.\n\n(1987) This section has been held consistent with Federal law. Wimberly v. Labor and Industrial Relations Commission of Missouri, 107 S.Ct. 821.\n\n(1987) This statute represents a neutral policy toward the fundamental right to bear children and decision to deny unemployment compensation to women who quit job to have a child pursuant to this statute is lawful.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an unemployed claimant otherwise eligible for benefits shall not become ineligible for benefits because of his enrollment in and satisfactory pursuit of a retraining course of instruction which the director has approved for the individual.\n\n2. An unemployed individual who files a claim for benefits may apply to the division for a determination of potential eligibility for benefits during a period of retraining or with respect to a claimant who has not applied for such determination, if the director finds the circumstances under subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section to exist, then the director shall make a complete determination under subsection 3 of this section, and where potential eligibility is determined, the director shall require the claimant to take a retraining course of instruction to be eligible for benefit payments.\n\n3. A determination of potential eligibility for benefits under this section and chapter shall be issued to an unemployed claimant if the director finds that:\n\n(1) Reasonable employment opportunities for which the unemployed claimant is fitted by training and experience do not exist or have substantially diminished in the labor market area in this state in which he is claiming benefits;\n\n(2) The retraining course of instruction relates to an occupation or skill for which there are, or are expected to be in the immediate future, reasonable employment opportunities in any labor market area in this state in which the claimant agrees to seek work;\n\n(3) The retraining course of instruction is one prescribed by the director;\n\n(4) The individual has the required qualifications and aptitudes to complete the course successfully and profit therefrom; and\n\n(5) Upon completion of his retraining course of instruction the individual should be qualified to use the skills acquired under labor organization rules where applicable to such skills.\n\n4.

Prior to January 1, 2005, the division shall institute procedures including, but not limited to, name, date of birth, and Social Security verification matches for remote claims filing via the use of telephone or the internet in accordance with such regulations as the division shall prescribe. At a minimum, the division shall verify the Social Security number and date of birth when an individual claimant initially files for unemployment insurance benefits. If verification information does not match what is on file in division databases to what the individual is stating, the division shall require the claimant to submit a division-approved form requesting an affidavit of eligibility prior to the payment of additional future benefits.

Chapter 85) payable to an individual under the provisions of this section for weeks of unemployment in his or her eligibility period;\n\n(7)\"Eligibility period\"of an individual means the period consisting of the weeks in his or her benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his or her benefit year ends within such extended benefit period, any weeks thereafter which begin in such period;\n\n(8)\"Exhaustee\"means an individual who, with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period:\n\n(a) Has received, prior to such week, all of the regular benefits that were available to him or her under this law or any other state law (including dependents' allowances and benefits payable to federal civilian employees and ex-servicemen under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 85) in his or her current benefit year that includes such week; provided, that, for the purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be deemed to have received all of the regular benefits that were available to him or her although as a result of a pending appeal with respect to wages or employment, or both, that were not considered in the original monetary determination in his or her benefit year, he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to added regular benefits; or\n\n(b) Has received, prior to such week, all the regular compensation available to him or her in his or her current benefit year that includes such week under the unemployment compensation law of the state in which he or she files a claim for extended compensation or the unemployment compensation law of any other state after a cancellation of some or all of his or her wage credits or the partial or total reduction of his or her right to regular compensation; or\n\n(c) His or her benefit year having expired prior to such week, he or she has insufficient wages or employment, or both, on the basis of which he or she could establish in any state a new benefit year that would include such week, or having established a new benefit year that includes such week, he or she is precluded from receiving regular compensation by reason of a state law provision which meets the requirement of Section 3304(a)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; and\n\n(d) a. Has no right to unemployment benefits or allowances, as the case may be, under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 and such other federal laws as are specified in regulations issued by the United States Secretary of Labor; and\n\nb. Has not received and is not seeking unemployment benefits under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; but if he or she is seeking such benefits and the appropriate agency finally determines that he or she is not entitled to benefits under such law he or she is considered an exhaustee;\n\n(9)\"State law\"means the unemployment insurance law of any state, approved by the United States Secretary of Labor under Section 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.\n\n2. Except when the result would be inconsistent with the other provisions of this section, as provided in the regulations of the director, the provisions of this law which apply to claims for, or the payment of, regular benefits shall apply to claims for, and the payment of, extended benefits.\n\n3. An individual shall be eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period only if the deputy finds that with respect to such week:\n\n(1) He or she is an exhaustee as defined in subdivision (8) of subsection 1 of this section;\n\n(2) He or she has satisfied the requirements of this law for the receipt of regular benefits that are applicable to individuals claiming extended benefits, including not being subject to a disqualification for the receipt of benefits; except that, in the case of a claim for benefits filed in another state, which is acting as an agent state under the Interstate Benefits Payment Plan as provided by regulation, which claim is based on benefit credits accumulated in this state, eligibility for extended benefits shall be limited to the first two compensable weeks unless there is an extended benefit period in effect in both this state and the agent state in which the claim was filed;\n\n(3) The other provisions of this law notwithstanding, as to new extended benefit claims filed after September 25, 1982, an individual shall be eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period only if the deputy finds that the total wages in the base period of his or her benefit year equal at least one and one-half times the wages paid during that quarter of his or her base period in which his or her wages were highest.\n\n4. A claimant shall not be eligible for extended benefits following any disqualification imposed under subsection 1 or 2 of section 288.050, unless subsequent to the effective date of the disqualification, the claimant has been employed during at least four weeks and has earned wages equal to at least four times his or her weekly benefit amount.\n\n5. For the purposes of determining eligibility for extended benefits, the term\"suitable work\"means any work which is within such individual's capabilities except that, if the individual furnishes satisfactory evidence that the prospects for obtaining work in his or her customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of what constitutes suitable work shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 288.050. If a deputy finds that a person who is claiming extended benefits has refused to accept or to apply for suitable work, as defined in this subsection, or has failed to actively engage in seeking work subsequent to the effective date of his or her claim for extended benefits, that person shall be ineligible for extended benefits for the period beginning with the first day of the week in which such refusal or failure occurred. That ineligibility shall remain in effect until the person has been employed for at least four weeks after the week in which the refusal or failure occurred and has earned wages equal to at least four times his or her weekly benefit amount.\n\n6. Extended benefits shall not be denied under subsection 5 of this section to any individual for any week by reason of a failure to accept an offer of or apply for suitable work if:\n\n(1) The gross average weekly remuneration for such work does not exceed the individual's weekly benefit amount plus the amount of any supplemental unemployment benefits, as defined in Section 501(c)(17)(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, payable to such individual for such week; or\n\n(2) The position was not offered to such individual in writing or was not listed with the state employment service; or\n\n(3) If the remuneration for the work offered is less than the minimum wage provided by Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, without regard to any exemption or any applicable minimum wage as provided in Section 202(a)(3)(D)(iv)(II) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, whichever is the greater. Pursuant to section 290.528, a local minimum wage is not authorized under state law.\n\n7. For the purposes of this section, an individual shall be considered as actively engaged in seeking work during any week with respect to which the individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work as indicated by tangible evidence which the individual provides to the division.\n\n8. Extended benefits shall not be denied for failure to apply for or to accept suitable work if such failure would not result in a denial of benefits under subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 to the extent that the provisions of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 are not inconsistent with the provisions of subsections 5 and 6 of this section.\n\n9. The division shall refer any claimant entitled to extended benefits under this law to any suitable work which meets the criteria established in subsections 5 and 6 of this section.\n\n10. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, as to claims of extended benefits, subsections 4 to 9 of this section shall not apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995. Entitlement to extended benefits for weeks beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995, shall be determined in accordance with provisions of this chapter not excluded by this subsection.\n\n11.\"Weekly extended benefit amount.\"The weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in his or her eligibility period shall be an amount equal to the weekly benefit amount payable to him or her during his or her applicable benefit year, reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of the reduction in federal payments to states under Section 204 of the Federal State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, in accord with any order issued under any law of the United States. Such weekly benefit amount, if not a multiple of one dollar, shall be reduced to the nearest lower full dollar amount.\n\n12. (1)\"Total extended benefit amount.\"The total extended benefit amount payable to any eligible individual with respect to his or her applicable benefit year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:\n\n(a) Fifty percent of the total amount of regular benefits which were payable to him or her under this law in his or her applicable benefit year;\n\n(b) Thirteen times his or her weekly benefit amount which was payable to him or her under this law for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of this subsection, during any fiscal year in which federal payments to states under Section 204 of the Federal State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 are reduced under any order issued under any law of the United States, the total extended benefit amount payable to an individual with respect to his or her applicable benefit year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate of the reductions under subsection 11 of this section in the weekly amounts paid to the individual.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if the benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such individual would, but for this subdivision, be entitled to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received trade readjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, within that benefit year, multiplied by the individual's weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.\n\n(4) (a) Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period, subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be applied by substituting:\n\na. Eighty percent for fifty percent in paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of this subsection; and\n\nb. Twenty times for thirteen times in paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the term\"high unemployment period\"means any period during which an extended benefit period would be in effect if subparagraph a. of paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section were applied by substituting eight percent for six and one-half percent.\n\n13. (1) Whenever an extended benefit period is to become effective in this state as a result of a state \"on\" indicator, or an extended benefit period is to be terminated in this state as a result of a state \"off\" indicator, the director shall make an appropriate public announcement.\n\n(2) Computations required by the provisions of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section shall be made by the director, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States Secretary of Labor.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 474, A.L. 1977 H.B. 707, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1521, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1251 & 1549, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1485, A.L. 1993 H.B. 492, A.L. 2009 H.B. 1075, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1544, A.L. 2011 H.B. 163, A.L. 2017 H.B. 1194 & 1193)",

All claims shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the division may prescribe; except that such regulations shall not require the filing of a claim for benefits by the claimant in person for a week of unemployment occurring immediately prior to the claimant's reemployment, but claims in such cases may be made by mail, or otherwise if authorized by regulation. Notice of each initial claim filed by an insured worker which establishes the beginning of such worker's benefit year shall be promptly mailed by the division to each base period employer of such individual, except notice of an initial claim shall not be mailed to any contributing base period employer which paid such individual gross wages in the amount of four hundred dollars or less during such individual's base period, and to the last employing unit whose name is furnished by the individual when such individual files such claim. In similar manner, a notice of each renewed claim filed by an insured worker during a benefit year after a period in such year during which the insured worker was employed shall be given to the last employing unit whose name is furnished by the individual when the individual files such renewed claim or to any other base period or subsequent employer of the worker who has requested such a notice. Any such base period employer or any employing unit, which employed the claimant since the beginning of the base period, who within ten calendar days after the mailing of notice of the initial claim or a renewed claim to the employer or employing unit's last known address files a written protest against the allowance of benefits, and any employing unit from whom the claimant was separated during a week claimed other than a week in which an initial or renewed claim is effective, shall be deemed an interested party to any determination allowing benefits during the benefit year until such time as the issue or issues raised by the protest are resolved by a determination or decision which has become final.\n\n2. If the last employer or any base period employer files a written protest against the allowance of benefits based upon the claimant's refusal to accept suitable work when offered the claimant, either through the division or directly by such last or base period employer, and such protest is filed within ten calendar days of the claimant's refusal of work, such employer shall be deemed an interested party to any determination concerning the claimant's refusal of work until such time as the issue or issues raised by the protest are resolved by a determination or decision which has become final.\n\n3. Any base period employer or any employing unit, which employed the claimant since the beginning of the base period, who files a written protest against the allowance of benefits based upon the claimant not being able to work or available for work shall be deemed an interested party to any determination concerning claimant's ability to work or availability for work until such time as the issue or issues raised by the protest are resolved by a determination or decision which has become final.\n\n4. A deputy shall promptly examine each initial claim and make a determination of the claimant's status as an insured worker. Each such determination shall be based on a written statement showing the amount of wages for insured work paid to the claimant by each employer during the claimant's base period and shall include a finding as to whether such wages meet the requirements for the claimant to be an insured worker, and, if so, the first day of the claimant's benefit year, the claimant's weekly benefit amount, and the maximum total amount of benefits which may be payable to the claimant for weeks of unemployment in the claimant's benefit year. The deputy shall in respect to all claims for benefits thereafter filed by such individual in the claimant's benefit year make a written determination as to whether and in what amount the claimant is entitled to benefits for the week or weeks with respect to which the determination is made. Whenever claims involve complex questions of law or fact, the deputy, with the approval of the director, may refer such claims to the appeals tribunal, without making a determination, for a fair hearing and decision as provided in section 288.190.\n\n5. The deputy shall, in writing, promptly notify the claimant of such deputy's determination on an initial claim, including the reason therefor, and a copy of the written statement as provided in subsection 4 of this section. The deputy shall promptly notify the claimant and all other interested parties of such deputy's determination on any claim for benefits and shall give the reason therefor; except that, where a determination on a later claim for benefits in a benefit year is the same as the determination on a preceding claim, no additional notice shall be given. A determination shall be final, when unappealed, in respect to any claim to which it applies except that an appeal from a determination on a claim for benefits shall be considered as an appeal from all later claims to which the same determination applies. The deputy may, however, not later than one year following the end of a benefit year, for good cause, reconsider any determination on any claim and shall promptly notify the claimant and other interested parties of such deputy's redetermination and the reasons therefor. Whenever the deputy shall have notified any interested employer of the denial of benefits to a claimant for any week or weeks and shall thereafter allow benefits to such claimant for a subsequent week or weeks, the deputy shall notify such interested employer of the beginning date of the allowance of benefits for such subsequent period.\n\n6. Unless the claimant or any interested party within thirty calendar days after notice of such determination is either delivered in person or mailed to the last known address of such claimant or interested party files an appeal from such determination, it shall be final. If, pursuant to a determination or redetermination, benefits are payable in any amount or in respect to any week as to which there is no dispute, such amount of benefits shall be promptly paid regardless of any appeal.\n\n7. Benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with a determination or redetermination pursuant to this section, or the decision of an appeals tribunal, the labor and industrial relations commission of Missouri or a reviewing court upon the issuance of such determination, redetermination or decision (regardless of the pendency of the period to apply for reconsideration, file an appeal, or petition for judicial review as provided in this section, or section 288.190, 288.200, or 288.210, as the case may be, or the pendency of any such application, appeal, or petition) unless and until such determination, redetermination or decision has been modified or reversed by a subsequent redetermination or decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied for weeks of unemployment thereafter in accordance with such modified or reversed redetermination or decision.\n\n8. Benefits paid during the pendency of the period to apply for reconsideration, file an appeal, or petition for judicial review or during the pendency of any such application, appeal, or petition shall be considered as having been due and payable regardless of any redetermination or decision unless the modifying or reversing redetermination or decision establishes that the claimant willfully failed to disclose or falsified any fact which would have disqualified the claimant or rendered the claimant ineligible for such benefits as contemplated in subsection 9 of section 288.380.\n\n9. Benefits paid during the pendency of the period to apply for reconsideration, file an appeal, or petition for judicial review or during the pendency of any such application, appeal, or petition which would not have been payable under a redetermination or decision which becomes final shall not be chargeable to any employer. Beginning with benefits paid on and after January 1, 1998, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to employers who have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions pursuant to subsection 3 of section 288.090.\n\n10. The ten-day period mentioned in subsections 1 and 2 of this section and the thirty-day period mentioned in subsection 6 of this section may, for good cause, be extended.\n\n11. Any notice of claim or notice of determination required to be mailed by the division to an employer or claimant under this section may be transmitted electronically by the division to any employer or claimant requesting such method of delivery.

Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year in which he is subject to this law. Such contributions shall become due and be paid by each employer to the division for the fund on or before the last day of the month following each calendar quarterly period of three months except when regulation requires monthly payment. Any employer upon application, or pursuant to a general or special regulation, may be granted an extension of time, not exceeding three months, for the making of his or her quarterly contribution and wage reports or for the payment of such contributions. Payment of contributions due shall be made to the treasurer designated pursuant to section 288.290.\n\n(1) In the payment of any contributions due, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to one cent;\n\n(2) Contributions shall not be deducted in whole or in part from the wages of individuals in employment.\n\n2. As of June thirtieth of each year, the division shall establish an average industry contribution rate for the next succeeding calendar year for each of the industrial classification divisions listed in the industrial classification system established by the federal government. The average industry contribution rate for each standard industrial classification division shall be computed by multiplying total taxable wages paid by each employer in the industrial classification division during the twelve consecutive months ending on June thirtieth by the employer's contribution rate established for the next calendar year and dividing the aggregate product for all employers in the industrial classification division by the total of taxable wages paid by all employers in the industrial classification division during the twelve consecutive months ending on June thirtieth. Each employer will be assigned to an industrial classification code division as determined by the division in accordance with the definitions contained in the industrial classification system established by the federal government, and shall pay contributions at the average industry rate established for the preceding calendar year for the industrial classification division to which it is assigned or two and seven-tenths percent of taxable wages paid by it, whichever is the greater, unless there have been at least twelve consecutive calendar months immediately preceding the calculation date throughout which its account could have been charged with benefits. The division shall classify all employers meeting this chargeability requirement for each calendar year in accordance with their actual experience in the payment of contributions on their own behalf and with respect to benefits charged against their accounts, with a view to fixing such contribution rates as will reflect such experience. The division shall determine the contribution rate of each such employer in accordance with sections 288.113 to 288.126. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any employing unit which becomes an employer pursuant to the provisions of subsection 7 or 8 of section 288.034 shall pay contributions equal to one percent of wages paid by it until its account has been chargeable with benefits for the period of time sufficient to enable it to qualify for a computed rate on the same basis as other employers.\n\n3. Benefits paid to employees of any governmental entity and nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection, a\"nonprofit organization\"is an organization (or group of organizations) described in Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code which is exempt from income tax under Section 501(a) of such code.\n\n(1) A governmental entity which, pursuant to subsection 7 of section 288.034, or nonprofit organization which, pursuant to subsection 8 of section 288.034, is, or becomes, subject to this law on or after April 27, 1972, shall pay contributions due under the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 of this section unless it elects, in accordance with this subdivision, to pay to the division for the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such governmental entity or nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment which begin during the effective period of such election; except that, with respect to benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 1, 1979, any such election by a governmental entity shall be to pay to the division for the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the amount of all regular benefits and all extended benefits paid that is attributable to service in the employ of such governmental entity.\n\n(a) A governmental entity or nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this law on or after April 27, 1972, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than one calendar year, provided it files with the division a written notice of its election within the thirty-day period immediately following the date of the determination of such subjectivity. The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 288.100 shall not apply in the calendar year 1998 and each calendar year thereafter, in the case of an employer who has elected to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(b) A governmental entity or nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subdivision will continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the division a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the calendar year for which such termination shall first be effective.\n\n(c) A governmental entity or any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this law for a period subsequent to January 1, 1972, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the division not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any calendar year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next calendar year.\n\n(d) The division, in accordance with such regulations as may be adopted, shall notify each governmental entity or nonprofit organization of any determination of its status of an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determination shall be subject to appeal as is provided in subsection 4 of section 288.130.\n\n(2) Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, as follows:\n\n(a) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the director, the division shall bill the governmental entity or nonprofit organization (or group of such organizations) which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization; except that, with respect to extended benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 1, 1979, which are attributable to service in the employ of a governmental entity, the governmental entity shall be billed for the full amount of such extended benefits.\n\n(b) Payment of any bill rendered under paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be due and shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last known address of the governmental entity or nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it.\n\n(c) Payments made by the governmental entity or nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization.\n\n(d) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that apply to past due contributions. Also, unpaid amounts in lieu of contributions, interest, penalties and surcharges are subject to the same assessment, civil action and compromise provisions of this law as apply to unpaid contributions. Further, the provisions of this law which provide for the adjustment or refund of contributions shall apply to the adjustment or refund of payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(3) If any governmental entity or nonprofit organization fails to timely file a required quarterly wage report, the division shall assess such entity or organization a penalty as provided in subsections 1 and 2 of section 288.160.\n\n(4) Except as provided in subsection 4 of this section, each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the division for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer; except that, with respect to benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 1, 1979, a governmental entity that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the division for the fund the amount of all regular benefits and all extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer in the base period of the claim, the amount chargeable to each employer shall be obtained by multiplying the benefits paid by a ratio obtained by dividing the base period wages from such employer by the total wages appearing in the base period.\n\n(5) Two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, may file a joint application to the division for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purposes of this subdivision. Upon approval of the application, the division shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the application was received and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the director or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bears to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The director shall prescribe such regulations as he or she deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this subdivision, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subdivision by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.\n\n4. Any employer which elects to make payments in lieu of contributions into the unemployment compensation fund as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section shall not be liable to make such payments with respect to the benefits paid to any individual whose base period wages include wages for previous work not classified as insured work as defined in section 288.030 to the extent that the unemployment compensation fund is reimbursed for such benefits pursuant to Section 121 of Public Law 94-566.\n\n5. Beginning January 1, 1998, and each calendar year thereafter, any employer which elects to make payments in lieu of contributions pursuant to subsection 3 of this section shall be liable for all benefit payments and shall not have charges relieved pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 288.100.\n\n6. (1) For the purposes of this chapter, a common paymaster arrangement will not exist unless approval has been obtained from the division. To receive a division-approved common paymaster arrangement, the related corporation designated to be the common paymaster for the related corporations must notify the division in writing at least thirty days prior to the beginning of the quarter in which the common paymaster reporting is to be effective. The common paymaster shall furnish the name and account number of each corporation in the related group that will be utilizing the one corporation as the common paymaster. The common paymaster shall also notify the division at least thirty days prior to any change in the related group of corporations or termination of the common paymaster arrangement. The common paymaster shall be responsible for keeping books and records for the payroll with respect to its own employees and the concurrently employed individuals of the related corporations. In order for remuneration to be eligible for the provisions applicable to a common paymaster, the individuals must be concurrently employed and the remuneration must be disbursed through the common paymaster. The common paymaster shall have the primary responsibility for remitting all required quarterly contribution and wage reports, contributions due with respect to the remuneration it disburses as the common paymaster and/or payments in lieu of contributions. The common paymaster shall compute the contributions due as though it were the sole employer of the concurrently employed individuals. If the common paymaster fails to remit the quarterly contribution and wage reports, contributions due and/or payments in lieu of contributions, in whole or in part, it shall remain liable for submitting the quarterly contribution and wage reports and the full amount of the unpaid portion of the contributions due and/or payments in lieu of contributions. In addition, each of the related corporations using the common paymaster shall be jointly and severally liable for submitting quarterly contribution and wage reports, its share of the contributions due and/or payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, interest and surcharges which are not submitted and/or paid by the common paymaster. All contributions due, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, interest and surcharges which are not timely paid to the division under a common paymaster arrangement shall be subject to the collection provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection,\"concurrent employment\"means the simultaneous existence of an employment relationship between an individual and two or more related corporations for any calendar quarter in which employees are compensated through a common paymaster which is one of the related corporations, those corporations shall be considered one employing unit and be subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection,\"related corporations\"means that corporations shall be considered related corporations for an entire calendar quarter if they satisfy any one of the following tests at any time during the calendar quarter:\n\n(a) The corporations are members of a controlled group of corporations. The term\"controlled group of corporations\"means:\n\na. Two or more corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation, if the parent corporation owns stock possessing at least fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least fifty percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each of the other corporations; or\n\nb. Two or more corporations, if five or less persons who are individuals, estates or trusts own stock possessing at least fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least fifty percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each of the other corporations; or\n\n(b) In the case of corporations which do not issue stock, at least fifty percent of the members of one corporation's board of directors are members of the board of directors of the other corporations; or\n\n(c) At least fifty percent of one corporation's officers are concurrently officers of the other corporations; or\n\n(d) At least thirty percent of one corporation's employees are concurrently employees of the other corporations.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564, A.L. 1965 p. 420, A.L. 1967 p. 396, A.L. 1972 S.B. 474, H.B. 1017, A.L. 1975 S.B. 275, A.L. 1977 H.B. 707, A.L. 1980 S.B. 583, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1251 & 1549, A.L. 1991 H.B. 422, et al., A.L. 1992 S.B. 626, A.L. 1993 H.B. 502, A.L. 1994 S.B. 559, A.L. 1995 H.B. 300 & 95, A.L. 1998 S.B. 922, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1268 & 1211, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1965, A.L. 2011 H.B. 136)",

(1) The division shall maintain a separate account for each employer which is paying contributions, and shall credit each employer's account with all contributions which each employer has paid. A separate account shall be maintained for each employer making payments in lieu of contributions to which shall be credited all such payments made. The account shall also show payments due as provided in section 288.090. The division may close and cancel such separate account after a period of four consecutive calendar years during which such employer has had no employment in this state subject to contributions. Nothing in this law shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in the employer's service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by the employer into the fund either on the employer's own behalf or on behalf of such individuals. Except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, regular benefits and that portion of extended benefits not reimbursed by the federal government paid to an eligible individual shall be charged against the accounts of the individual's base period employers who are paying contributions subject to the provisions of subdivision (4) of subsection 3 of section 288.090. With respect to initial claims filed after December 31, 1984, for benefits paid to an individual based on wages paid by one or more employers in the base period of the claim, the amount chargeable to each employer shall be obtained by multiplying the benefits paid by a ratio obtained by dividing the base period wages from such employer by the total wages appearing in the base period. Except as provided in this subdivision, the maximum amount of extended benefits paid to an individual and charged against the account of any employer shall not exceed one-half of the product obtained by multiplying the benefits paid by a ratio obtained by dividing the base period wages from such employer by the total wages appearing in the base period. The provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after December 31, 1978, the maximum amount of extended benefits paid to an individual and charged against the account of an employer which is an employer pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 288.032 and which is paying contributions pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of section 288.090 shall not exceed the calculated entitlement for the extended benefit claim based upon the wages appearing within the base period of the extended benefit claim.\n\n(2) Beginning as of June 30, 1951, and as of June thirtieth of each year thereafter, any unassigned surplus in the unemployment compensation fund which is five hundred thousand dollars or more in excess of five-tenths of one percent of the total taxable wages paid by all employers for the preceding calendar year as shown on the division's records on such June thirtieth shall be credited on a pro rata basis to all employer accounts having a credit balance in the same ratio that the balance in each such account bears to the total of the credit balances subject to use for rate calculation purposes for the following year in all such accounts on the same date. As used in this subdivision, the term\"unassigned surplus\"means the amount by which the total cash balance in the unemployment compensation fund exceeds a sum equal to the total of all employer credit account balances. The amount thus prorated to each separate employer's account shall for tax rating purposes be considered the same as contributions paid by the employer and credited to the employer's account for the period preceding the calculation date except that no such amount can be credited against any contributions due or that may thereafter become due from such employer.\n\n(3) At the conclusion of each calendar quarter the division shall, within thirty days, notify each employer by mail of the benefits paid to each claimant by week as determined by the division which have been charged to such employer's account subsequent to the last notice.\n\n(4) (a) No benefits based on wages paid for services performed prior to the date of any act for which a claimant is disqualified pursuant to section 288.050 shall be chargeable to any employer directly involved in such disqualifying act.\n\n(b) In the event the deputy has in due course determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 that a claimant quit his or her work with an employer for the purpose of accepting a more remunerative job with another employer which the claimant did accept and earn some wages therein, no benefits based on wages paid prior to the date of the quit shall be chargeable to the employer the claimant quit.\n\n(c) In the event the deputy has in due course determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 that a claimant quit temporary work in employment with an employer to return to the claimant's regular employer, then, only for the purpose of charging base period employers, all of the wages paid by the employer who furnished the temporary employment shall be combined with the wages actually paid by the regular employer as if all such wages had been actually paid by the regular employer. Further, charges for benefits based on wages paid for part-time work shall be removed from the account of the employer furnishing such part-time work if that employer continued to employ the individual claiming such benefits on a regular recurring basis each week of the claimant's claim to at least the same extent that the employer had previously employed the claimant and so informs the division within thirty days from the date of notice of benefit charges.\n\n(d) No charge shall be made against an employer's account in respect to benefits paid an individual if the gross amount of wages paid by such employer to such individual is four hundred dollars or less during the individual's base period on which the individual's benefit payments are based. Further, no charge shall be made against any employer's account in respect to benefits paid any individual unless such individual was in employment with respect to such employer longer than a probationary period of twenty-eight days, if such probationary period of employment has been reported to the division as required by regulation.\n\n(e) In the event the deputy has in due course determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 that a claimant is not disqualified, no benefits based on wages paid for work prior to the date of the quit shall be chargeable to the employer the claimant quit.\n\n(f) In the event the deputy has in due course determined under paragraph (e) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 288.050 that a claimant is not disqualified, no benefits based on wages paid for work prior to the date of the quit shall be chargeable to the employer the claimant quit.\n\n(g) Nothing in paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this subdivision shall in any way affect the benefit amount, duration of benefits or the wage credits of the claimant.\n\n2. The division may prescribe regulations for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and shall, in accordance with such regulations and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, maintain such joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account.\n\n3. The division may by regulation provide for the compilation and publication of such data as may be necessary to show the amounts of benefits not charged to any individual employer's account classified by reason no such charge was made and to show the types and amounts of transactions affecting the unemployment compensation fund.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564, A.L. 1957 p. 531, A.L. 1959 S.B. 231, A.L. 1961 p. 430, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1017, A.L. 1977 H.B. 707, A.L. 1979 S.B. 477, A.L. 1980 S.B. 583, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1251 & 1549, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1485, A.L. 1994 S.B. 559, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1368, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1268 & 1211, A.L. 2011 H.B. 136)",

Transfer of employer accounts — successor employer liabilities — unemployment experience, how treated — penalties — definitions. —1. Any individual, type of organization or employing unit which has acquired substantially all of the business of an employer, excepting in any such case any assets retained by such employer incident to the liquidation of the employer's obligations, and in respect to which the division finds that immediately after such change such business of the predecessor employer is continued without interruption solely by the successor, shall stand in the position of such predecessor employer in all respects, including the predecessor's separate account, actual contribution and benefit experience, annual payrolls, and liability for current or delinquent contributions, interest and penalties. If two or more individuals, organizations, or employing units acquired at approximately the same time substantially all of the business of an employer (excepting in any such case any assets retained by such employer incident to the liquidation of his obligations) and in respect to which the division finds that immediately after such change all portions of such business of the predecessor are continued without interruption solely by such successors, each such individual, organization, or employing unit shall stand in the position of such predecessor with respect to the proportionate share of the predecessor's separate account, actual contribution and benefit experience and annual payroll as determined by the portion of the predecessor's taxable payroll applicable to the portion of the business acquired, and each such individual, organization or employing unit shall be liable for current or delinquent contributions, interest and penalties of the predecessor in the same relative proportion. Further, any successor under this section which was not an employer at the time the acquisition occurred shall pay contributions for the balance of the current rate year at the same contribution rate as the contribution rate of the predecessor whether such rate is more or less than two and seven-tenths percent, provided there was only one predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates. If the predecessors' rates were not identical, the division shall calculate a rate as of the date of acquisition applicable to the successor for the remainder of the rate year, which rate shall be based on the combined experience of all predecessor employers. In the event that any successor was, prior to an acquisition, an employer, and there is a difference in the contribution rate established for such calendar year applicable to any acquired or acquiring employer, the division shall make a recalculation of the contribution rate applicable to any successor employer based upon the combined experience of all predecessor and successor employers as of the date of the acquisition, unless the date of the acquisition is other than the first day of the calendar quarter. If the date of any such acquisition is other than the first day of the calendar quarter, the division shall make the recalculation of the rate on the first day of the next calendar quarter after the acquisition. When the date of the acquisition is other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the successor employer shall use its rate for the calendar quarter in which the acquisition was made. The revised contribution rate shall apply to employment after the rate recalculation. For this purpose a calculation date different from July first may be established. When the division has determined that a successor or successors stand in the position of a predecessor employer, the predecessor's liability shall be terminated as of the date of the acquisition.\n\n2. If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to another employer and at the time of the transfer there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the two employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom such business is so transferred. The rates and liabilities of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective under this section.\n\n3. Whenever any individual, type of organization, or employing unit is not an employer under this chapter at the time it acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such individual, organization, or employing unit if the division finds that such individual, organization, or employing unit acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, such individual, organization, or employing unit shall be assigned the applicable new employer rate under section 288.090. In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the division shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the individual, organization, or employing unit continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.\n\n4. (1) If an individual, organization, or employing unit knowingly violates or attempts to violate this section or any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution rate, or if an individual, organization or employing unit knowingly advises another individual, organization, or employing unit in a manner that results in a violation of such provision, the individual, organization, or employing unit shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(a) If the individual, organization, or employing unit is an employer under this chapter, then for the current year and the three rate years immediately following this rate year, such employer's base rate shall be the maximum base rate applicable to such type of employer, or the employer's current base rate plus two percent, whichever is greater;\n\n(b) If the individual, organization, or employing unit is not an employer under this chapter, such individual, organization, or employing unit shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than five thousand dollars. Any such fine shall be deposited in the special employment security fund established under section 288.310.\n\n(2) In addition to the penalty imposed by this subsection, any violation of this section may be prosecuted under section 288.395.\n\n5.

If any employer neglects or refuses to make a report as required by this chapter the division shall make an estimate based on any information in its possession or that may come into its possession of the amount of wages paid by such employer for the period in respect to which the employer failed to make the report, and upon the basis of such estimated amount compute and assess the contributions and interest payable by such employer, adding to such sum a penalty as set forth in subsection 2 of this section. Promptly thereafter, the division shall give to such employer written notice of such estimated contributions, interest and penalties as so assessed, the notice to be served by certified mail, directed to the last known address of such employer.\n\n2. If any employer neglects or refuses to file any required report by the last day of the month following the due date there shall be imposed a penalty, equal to the greater of one hundred dollars or ten percent of the contributions required to be shown on the report, for each month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, provided, however, that the penalty shall not exceed the greater of two hundred dollars or twenty percent of the contributions in the aggregate.\n\n3.

If fraud or evasion on the part of any employer is discovered by the division, the division shall determine the amount by which the state has been defrauded, shall add to the amount so determined a penalty equal to twenty-five percent thereof, and shall assess the same against the employer. The amount so assessed shall be immediately due and payable; provided, however, that the division shall promptly thereafter give to such employer written notice of such assessment.\n\n5. Any employer against whom an assessment is made pursuant to the provisions of subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this section may petition for reassessment.

These employees shall be offered the same benefits plan under the same terms and conditions as other state employees. The Missouri consolidated health care plan shall not assume responsibility for any liabilities incurred by the department, or its eligible employees, retirees or dependents prior to January 1, 1996.\n\n(2) During calendar year 1995, the department of labor and industrial relations, the office of administration and the Missouri state employees' retirement system shall determine the feasibility of transitioning employees of the department of labor and industrial relations who meet the eligibility requirements set forth for officers, employees or retirees of the state or its participating agencies, over to the group life insurance benefit plan provided by the Missouri state employees' retirement system.\n\n(L. 1965 p. 433, A.L. 1995 H.B. 300 & 95)",

The provisions of subsections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this section, to the extent that they relate to the federal Unemployment Trust Fund, shall be operative only so long as such federal Unemployment Trust Fund continues to exist and so long as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by contributions from employers of this state for benefit purposes, and by money credited pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, together with a proportionate share of the earnings apportioned to the Missouri account of such federal Unemployment Trust Fund, from which no other state is permitted to make or authorize withdrawals.

State liability for benefits limited, authority for application and repayment of federal advances — board of unemployment fund financing created, duties, requirements, powers — disposition of unobligated funds. —1. Benefits shall be deemed to be due and payable only to the extent that moneys are available to the credit of the unemployment compensation fund and neither the state nor the division shall be liable for any amount in excess of such sums. The governor is authorized to apply for an advance to the state unemployment fund and to accept the responsibility for the repayment of such advance in order to secure to this state and its citizens the advantages available under the provisions of federal law.\n\n2. (1) The purpose of this subsection is to provide a method of providing funds for the payment of unemployment benefits or maintaining an adequate fund balance in the unemployment compensation fund, and as an alternative to borrowing or obtaining advances from the federal unemployment trust fund or for refinancing those loans or advances.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection,\"credit instrument\"means any type of borrowing obligation issued under this section, including any bonds, commercial line of credit note, tax anticipation note or similar instrument.\n\n(3) (a) There is hereby created for the purposes of implementing the provisions of this subsection a body corporate and politic to be known as the \"Board of Unemployment Fund Financing\". The powers of the board shall be vested in five board members who shall be the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, director of the department of labor and industrial relations, and the commissioner of administration. The board shall have all powers necessary to effectuate its purposes including, without limitation, the power to provide a seal, keep records of its proceedings, and provide for professional services. The governor shall serve as chair, the lieutenant governor shall serve as vice chair, and the commissioner of administration shall serve as secretary. Staff support for the board shall be provided by the commissioner of administration.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary:\n\na. No officer or employee of this state shall be deemed to have forfeited or shall forfeit his or her office or employment by reason of his or her acceptance of an appointment as a board member or for his or her service to the board;\n\nb. Board members shall receive no compensation for the performance of their duties under this subsection, but each commissioner shall be reimbursed from the funds of the commission for his or her actual and necessary expenses incurred in carrying out his or her official duties under this subsection.\n\n(c) In the event that any of the board members or officers of the board whose signatures or facsimile signatures appear on any credit instrument shall cease to be board members or officers before the delivery of such credit instrument, their signatures or facsimile signatures shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such board members or officers had remained in office until delivery of such credit instrument.\n\n(d) Neither the board members executing the credit instruments of the board nor any other board members shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the credit instruments.\n\n(4) The board is authorized, by offering for public negotiated sale, to issue, sell, and deliver credit instruments, bearing interest at a fixed or variable rate as shall be determined by the board, which shall mature no later than ten years after issuance, in the name of the board in an amount determined by the board. Such credit instruments may be issued, sold, and delivered for the purposes set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Such credit instrument may only be issued upon the approval of a resolution authorizing such issuance by a simple majority of the members of the board, with no other proceedings required.\n\n(5) The board shall provide for the payment of the principal of the credit instruments, any redemption premiums, the interest on the credit instruments, and the costs attributable to the credit instruments being issued or outstanding as provided in this chapter. Unless the board directs otherwise, the credit instrument shall be repaid in the same time frame and in the same amounts as would be required for loans issued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1321; however, in no case shall credit instruments be outstanding for more than ten years.\n\n(6) The board may irrevocably pledge money received from the credit instrument and financing agreement repayment surcharge under subsection 3 of section 288.128, and other money legally available to it, which is deposited in an account authorized for credit instrument repayment in the special employment security fund, provided that the general assembly has first appropriated moneys received from such surcharge and other moneys deposited in such account for the payment of credit instruments.\n\n(7) Credit instruments issued under this section shall not constitute debts of this state or of the board or any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of this state and are not a pledge of the faith and credit of this state, the board or of any of those governmental entities and shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation upon the incurring of indebtedness. The credit instruments are payable only from revenue provided for under this chapter. The credit instruments shall contain a statement to the effect that:\n\n(a) Neither the state nor the board nor any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of the state shall be obligated to pay the principal or interest on the credit instruments except as provided by this section; and\n\n(b) Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state nor the board nor any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of the state is pledged to the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the credit instruments.\n\n(8) The board pledges and agrees with the owners of any credit instruments issued under this section that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the board to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the owners or in any way impair the rights and remedies of the owners until the credit instruments are fully discharged.\n\n(9) The board may prescribe the form, details, and incidents of the credit instruments and make such covenants that in its judgment are advisable or necessary to properly secure the payment thereof. If such credit instruments shall be authenticated by the bank or trust company acting as registrar for such by the manual signature of a duly authorized officer or employee thereof, the duly authorized officers of the board executing and attesting such credit instruments may all do so by facsimile signature provided such signatures have been duly filed as provided in the uniform facsimile signature of public officials law, sections 105.273 to 105.278, when duly authorized by resolution of the board, and the provisions of section 108.175 shall not apply to such credit instruments. The board may provide for the flow of funds and the establishment and maintenance of separate accounts within the special employment security fund, including the interest and sinking account, the reserve account, and other necessary accounts, and may make additional covenants with respect to the credit instruments in the documents authorizing the issuance of credit instruments including refunding credit instruments. The resolutions authorizing the issuance of credit instruments may also prohibit the further issuance of credit instruments or other obligations payable from appropriated moneys or may reserve the right to issue additional credit instruments to be payable from appropriated moneys on a parity with or subordinate to the lien and pledge in support of the credit instruments being issued and may contain other provisions and covenants as determined by the board, provided that any terms, provisions or covenants provided in any resolution of the board shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this section.\n\n(10) The board may issue credit instruments to refund all or any part of the outstanding credit instruments issued under this section including matured but unpaid interest. As with other credit instruments issued under this section, such refunding credit instruments may bear interest at a fixed or variable rate as determined by the board.\n\n(11) The credit instruments issued by the board, any transaction relating to the credit instruments, and profits made from the sale of the credit instruments are free from taxation by the state or by any municipality, court, special district, or other political subdivision of the state.\n\n(12) As determined necessary by the board the proceeds of the credit instruments less the cost of issuance shall be placed in the state's unemployment compensation fund and may be used for the purposes for which that fund may otherwise be used. If those net proceeds are not placed immediately in the unemployment compensation fund they shall be held in the special employment security fund in an account designated for that purpose until they are transferred to the unemployment compensation fund provided that the proceeds of refunding credit instruments may be placed in an escrow account or such other account or instrument as determined necessary by the board.\n\n(13) The board may enter into any contract or agreement deemed necessary or desirable to effectuate cost-effective financing hereunder. Such agreements may include credit enhancement, credit support, or interest rate agreements including, but not limited to, arrangements such as municipal bond insurance; surety bonds; tax anticipation notes; liquidity facilities; forward agreements; tender agreements; remarketing agreements; option agreements; interest rate swap, exchange, cap, lock or floor agreements; letters of credit; and purchase agreements. Any fees or costs associated with such agreements shall be deemed administrative expenses for the purposes of calculating the credit instrument and financing agreement repayment surcharge under subsection 3 of section 288.128. The board, with consideration of all other costs being equal, shall give preference to Missouri-headquartered financial institutions, or those out-of-state-based financial institutions with at least one hundred Missouri employees.\n\n(14) To the extent this section conflicts with other laws the provisions of this section prevail. This section shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 23.250 to 23.298.\n\n(15) If the United States Secretary of Labor holds that a provision of this subsection or of any provision related to the levy or use of the credit instrument and financial agreement repayment surcharge does not conform with a federal statute or would result in the loss to the state of any federal funds otherwise available to it the board, in cooperation with the department of labor and industrial relations, may administer this subsection, and other provisions related to the credit instrument and financial agreement repayment surcharge, to conform with the federal statute until the general assembly meets in its next regular session and has an opportunity to amend this subsection or other sections, as applicable.\n\n(16) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the officials of the state from borrowing from the government of the United States in order to pay unemployment benefits under subsection 1 of this section or otherwise.\n\n(17) (a) As used in this subdivision the term\"lender\"means any state or national bank.\n\n(b) The board is authorized to enter financial agreements with any lender for the purposes set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection, or to refinance other financial agreements in whole or in part, upon the approval of the simple majority of the members of the board of a resolution authorizing such financial agreements, with no other proceedings required. In no instance shall the outstanding obligation under any financial agreement continue for more than ten years. Repayment of obligations to lenders shall be made from the special employment security fund, section 288.310, subject to appropriation by the general assembly.\n\n(c) Financial agreements entered into under this subdivision shall not constitute debts of this state or of the board or any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of this state and are not a pledge of the faith and credit of this state, the board or of any of those governmental entities and shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation upon the incurring of indebtedness. The financial agreements are payable only from revenue provided for under this chapter. The financial agreements shall contain a statement to the effect that:\n\na. Neither the state nor the board nor any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of the state shall be obligated to pay the principal or interest on the financial agreements except as provided by this section; and\n\nb. Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state nor the board nor any agency, political corporation, or political subdivision of the state is pledged to the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the financial agreements.\n\n(d) Neither the board members executing the financial agreements nor any other board members shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the execution of such financial agreements.\n\n(e) The board may prescribe the form, details and incidents of the financing agreements and make such covenants that in its judgment are advisable or necessary to properly secure the payment thereof provided that any terms, provisions or covenants provided in any such financing agreement shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this section. If such financing agreements shall be authenticated by the bank or trust company acting as registrar for such by the manual signature of a duly authorized officer or employee thereof, the duly authorized officers of the board executing and attesting such financing agreements may all do so by facsimile signature provided such signatures have been duly filed as provided in the uniform facsimile signature of public officials law, sections 105.273 to 105.278, when duly authorized by resolution of the board and the provisions of section 108.175 shall not apply to such financing agreements.\n\n(18) The commission may issue credit instruments to refund all or any part of the outstanding borrowing issued under this section including matured but unpaid interest.\n\n(19) The credit instruments issued by the commission, any transaction relating to the credit instruments, and profits made from the issuance of credit are free from taxation by the state or by any municipality, court, special district, or other political subdivision of the state.\n\n3. In event of the suspension of this law, any unobligated funds in the unemployment compensation fund, and returned by the United States Treasurer because such Federal Social Security Act is inoperative, shall be held in custody by the treasurer and under supervision of the division until the legislature shall provide for the disposition thereof. In event no disposition is made by the legislature at the next regular meeting subsequent to suspension of said law, then all unobligated funds shall be returned ratably to those who contributed thereto.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, in the event that the amount of moneys owed by the fund for total advancements by the federal government exceeds three hundred million dollars, the board shall be required to meet to consider authorizing the issuance, sale, and delivery of credit instruments pursuant to this section for the entire amount of the debt owed.\n\n5. If credit instruments are issued under subsection 4 of this section, the interest assessment required under section 288.128 shall continue to be paid and used to fully finance such instruments and shall be paid at the same rate applicable at the time of issuance for all subsequent years until the credit instruments are fully financed.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564 § 288.210, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1521, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1268 & 1211 and S.B. 966 § 1, A.L. 2006 H.B. 1456, A.L. 2009 H.B. 1075, A.L. 2015 H.B. 150)\n\n*Effective 10-16-15, see § 21.250.

In the administration of this law, the division shall cooperate to the fullest extent consistent with the provisions of this law, with the United States Department of Labor; shall make such reports in such form and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require; and shall comply with such directives as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports; and shall comply with the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor governing the expenditures of such sums as may be allotted and paid to this state under Title III of the Federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 501 et seq.) for the purpose of assisting in the administration of this law. The division may make its records available to the Railroad Retirement Board, and may furnish the Railroad Retirement Board, at the expense of such board, such copies thereof as the Railroad Retirement Board deems necessary for its purposes. The division may afford reasonable cooperation with every agency of the United States charged with the administration of an unemployment insurance law.\n\n2. The administration of this law and of other state employment security, unemployment insurance and public employment service laws will be promoted by cooperation between this state and such other states in exchanging services and making available facilities and information. The division is authorized to make such investigations, secure and transmit such information, make available such services and facilities and exercise such of the other powers provided herein with respect to the administration of this law as it deems necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any such employment security, unemployment insurance or public employment law and in like manner to accept and utilize information, services and facilities made available to this state by the agency charged with the administration of any other employment security, unemployment insurance or public employment service law.\n\n3. The division shall fully cooperate with the agencies of other states and shall make every proper effort within its means to oppose and prevent any further action which would, in its judgment, tend to effect complete or substantial federalization of the unemployment compensation fund of this state or of the states generally or of the unemployment insurance and employment security programs of this state or of the states generally or of any part of the Social Security program.\n\n4. Upon request therefor the division shall furnish to any agency of the United States charged with the administration of public works or assistance through public employment, the name, address, ordinary occupation, and employment status of each recipient of benefits and such recipient's rights to further benefits under this law.\n\n5. For the purpose of establishing and maintaining free public employment offices, the division is authorized to enter into agreements with any agency of the United States charged with the administration of an unemployment insurance law, with any political subdivision of this state or with any private, nonprofit organization, and as a part of any such agreement the division may accept moneys, services, or quarters as a contribution to the unemployment compensation administration fund.\n\n6. (1) The division is hereby authorized to enter into arrangements with the appropriate agencies of other states or of the federal government:\n\n(a) Whereby wages or services, upon the basis of which an individual may become entitled to benefits under the unemployment insurance law of another state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be wages for insured work for the purposes of this law, provided such other state agency or agency of the federal government has agreed to reimburse the fund for such portion of benefits paid under this law upon the basis of such wages or services as the division finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests; and\n\n(b) Whereby the division will reimburse other state or federal agencies charged with the administration of unemployment insurance laws with such reasonable portion of benefits, paid under the law of any such other states or of the federal government upon the basis of employment or wages for insured work, as the division finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests.\n\n(2) The division is hereby authorized to make to other state or federal agencies and receive from such other state or federal agencies, reimbursements from or to the fund, in accordance with arrangements pursuant to this section.\n\n7.

The division is hereby authorized to enter into reciprocal arrangements with appropriate and duly authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government, or both, whereby:\n\n(1) Services performed by an individual for a single employing unit for which services are customarily performed by such individual in more than one state shall be deemed to be services performed entirely within any one of the states (i) in which any part of such individual's services are performed, or (ii) in which such individual has his residence, or (iii) in which the employing unit maintains a place of business; provided, there is in effect, as to such services an election, approved by the agency charged with the administration of such state's unemployment insurance law, pursuant to which all of the services performed by such individual for such employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within such state;\n\n(2) Potential rights to benefits accumulated under the unemployment insurance law of one or more states or under one or more such laws of the federal government, or both, may constitute the basis of the payment of benefits through a single appropriate agency under terms which the division finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests and will not result in any substantial loss to the fund;\n\n(3) Wages, upon the basis of which an individual may become entitled to benefits under an unemployment insurance law of another state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be wages for insured work for the purpose of determining his right to benefits under this law and wages for insured work, on the basis of which an individual may become entitled to benefits under this law shall be deemed to be wages on the basis of which unemployment insurance under such law of another state or of the federal government is payable, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provision for reimbursements to the fund for such of the benefits paid under this law upon the basis of such wages and provisions for reimbursements from the fund for such of the benefits paid under such other law upon the basis of wages for insured work as the division finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests; and\n\n(4) Contributions due under this law with respect to wages for insured work shall, for the purposes of section 288.090, be deemed to have been paid to the fund as of the date of payment was made as contributions therefor under another state or federal unemployment insurance law, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provisions for such reimbursements to the fund of such contributions and the actual earnings thereon, as the division finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.\n\n9. The division is hereby authorized to enter into arrangements with the appropriate agencies of other states or the federal government whereby individuals performing services in this and other states for a single employing unit under circumstances not specifically provided for in section 288.034, or under similar provisions in the unemployment insurance laws of such other states, shall be deemed to be engaged in employment performed entirely within this state or within one of such other states and whereby potential rights to benefits accumulated under the unemployment insurance laws of several states or under such a law of the federal government, or both, may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits through a single appropriate agency under terms which the division finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests and will not result in any substantial loss to the fund.\n\n10. Reimbursements paid from the fund pursuant to subsection 6 of this section shall be deemed to be benefits for the purpose of section 288.060. To the extent that may be necessary, the division is authorized to make to other state or federal agencies and to receive from such other state or federal agencies, reimbursements from and to the fund, in accordance with arrangements entered into pursuant to the provisions of this and any other section of the employment security law.\n\n11. On request of an agency which administers an employment security law of another state, and which has found in accordance with the provisions of such law that a claimant is liable to repay benefits received under such law by reason of having knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to a claim taken in this state as an agent for such agency, the division shall collect the amount of such benefits from such claimant to be refunded to such agency. In any case in which under this subsection a claimant is liable to repay any amount to the agency of another state, such amounts may be collected without interest by civil action in the name of the division acting as agent for such agency.\n\n12. In the administration of the provisions of this law, which are enacted to conform with the requirements of the Federal Employment Security Amendments of 1970, the director shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the provisions are so interpreted and applied as to meet the requirements of such federal act as interpreted by the United States Department of Labor, and to secure to this state the full reimbursement of the federal share of extended benefits paid under this law that are reimbursable under the federal act.\n\n13. The division shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual's wages and employment covered under this law with his wages and employment covered under the unemployment compensation laws of other states which are approved by the United States Secretary of Labor in consultation with the state unemployment compensation agencies as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of compensation in such situations and which include provisions for\n\n(1) Applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual's wages and employment covered under two or more state unemployment compensation laws, and\n\n(2) Avoiding the duplicate use of wages and employment by reason of such combining.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 564 § 288.220, A.L. 1972 S.B. 474)\n\nEffective 1-20-72",

In addition, the deputy shall assess a penalty equal to twenty-five percent of the amount fraudulently obtained or denied. If division records indicate that the individual or employer had a prior established overpayment or record of denial due to fraud, the deputy shall, on the present overpayment or determination, assess a penalty equal to one hundred percent of the amount fraudulently obtained.\n\n(2) Unless the individual or employer within thirty calendar days after notice of such determination of overpayment by fraud is either delivered in person or mailed to the last known address of such individual or employer files an appeal from such determination, it shall be final.

If the individual or employer fails to repay the unemployment benefits that the individual or employer denied or obtained by fraud, the division may offset from any future unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of the overpayment, or may take such steps as are necessary to effect payment from the individual or employer. Future benefits may not be used to offset the penalty due. Money received in repayment of fraudulently obtained or denied unemployment benefits and penalties shall first be applied to the unemployment benefits overpaid, then to the penalty amount due. Regarding and for payments made toward the penalty, an amount equal to fifteen percent of the total amount of benefits fraudulently obtained shall be immediately deposited into the state's unemployment compensation fund upon receipt and the remaining penalty amount shall be credited to the special employment security fund.\n\n(4) If fraud or evasion on the part of any employer is discovered by the division, the employer will be subject to the fraud provisions of subsection 4 of section 288.160.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection shall become effective July 1, 2005.\n\n10.

It shall be presumed that such failure or falsification was willful in any case in which an individual signs and certifies a claim for benefits and fails to disclose or falsifies as to any fact relative to such claim.\n\n11.

Any amount otherwise required to be so deducted and withheld from such unemployment compensation pursuant to properly served legal process, as that term is defined in Section 459(i) of the Social Security Act; or any amount otherwise required to be deducted and withheld from the unemployment compensation pursuant to Section 13(c)(3)(b) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977;\n\n(c) Any amount deducted and withheld pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall be paid by the division to the appropriate state or local support enforcement agency or state food stamp agency;\n\n(d) Any amount deducted and withheld pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall, for all purposes, be treated as if it were paid to the individual as unemployment compensation and paid by such individual to the state or local support enforcement agency in satisfaction of the individual's support obligations or to the state food stamp agency to which the uncollected overissuance is owed as repayment of the individual's uncollected overissuance;\n\n(e) For purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this subdivision, the term\"unemployment compensation\"means any compensation payable pursuant to this chapter, including amounts payable by the division pursuant to an agreement pursuant to any federal law providing for compensation, assistance, or allowances with respect to unemployment;\n\n(f) Deductions will be made pursuant to this section only if appropriate arrangements have been made for reimbursement by the state or local support enforcement agency, or the state food stamp agency, for the administrative costs incurred by the division pursuant to this section which are attributable to support obligations being enforced by the state or local support enforcement agency or which are attributable to uncollected overissuances of food stamp coupons;\n\n(g) The term\"support obligations\"is defined for purposes of this subsection as including only obligations which are being enforced pursuant to a plan described in Section 454 of the Social Security Act which has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act;\n\n(h) The term\"state or local support enforcement agency\", as used in this subsection, means any agency of a state, or political subdivision thereof, operating pursuant to a plan described in paragraph (g) of this subdivision;\n\n(i) The term\"state food stamp agency\"as used in this subsection means any agency of a state, or political subdivision thereof, operating pursuant to a plan described in the Food Stamp Act of 1977;\n\n(j) The director may prescribe the procedures to be followed and the form and contents of any documents required in carrying out the provisions of this subsection;\n\n(k) The division shall comply with the following priority when deducting and withholding amounts from any unemployment compensation payable to an individual:\n\na. Before withholding any amount for child support obligations or uncollected overissuances of food stamp coupons, the division shall first deduct and withhold from any unemployment compensation payable to an individual the amount, as determined by the division, owed pursuant to subsection 12 or 13 of this section;\n\nb. If, after deductions are made pursuant to subparagraph a. of this paragraph, an individual has remaining unemployment compensation amounts due and owing, and the individual owes support obligations or uncollected overissuances of food stamp coupons, the division shall first deduct and withhold any remaining unemployment compensation amounts for application to child support obligations owed by the individual;\n\nc. If, after deductions are made pursuant to subparagraphs a. and b. of this paragraph, an individual has remaining unemployment compensation amounts due and owing, and the individual owes uncollected overissuances of food stamp coupons, the division shall deduct and withhold any remaining unemployment compensation amounts for application to uncollected overissuances of food stamp coupons owed by the individual.\n\n12. Any person who, by reason of the nondisclosure or misrepresentation by such person or by another of a material fact, has received any sum as benefits pursuant to this chapter while any conditions for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter were not fulfilled in such person's case, or while he or she was disqualified from receiving benefits, shall, in the discretion of the division, either be liable to have such sums deducted from any future benefits payable to such person pursuant to this chapter or shall be liable to repay to the division for the unemployment compensation fund a sum equal to the amounts so received by him or her. The division may recover such sums in accordance with the provisions of subsection 14 of this section.\n\n13. Any person who, by reason of any error or omission or because of a lack of knowledge of material fact on the part of the division, has received any sum of benefits pursuant to this chapter while any conditions for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter were not fulfilled in such person's case, or while such person was disqualified from receiving benefits, shall after an opportunity for a fair hearing pursuant to subsection 2 of section 288.190, in the discretion of the division, either be liable to have such sums deducted from any further benefits payable to such person pursuant to this chapter, or shall be liable to repay to the division for the unemployment compensation fund a sum equal to the amounts so received by him or her. The division may recover such sums in accordance with the provisions of subsection 14 of this section. However, the division may elect not to process such possible overpayments where the amount of same is not over twenty percent of the maximum state weekly benefit amount in effect at the time the error or omission was discovered.\n\n14. Recovering overpaid unemployment compensation benefits shall be pursued by the division against any person receiving such overpaid unemployment compensation benefits through billing, setoffs against state and federal tax refunds to the extent permitted by federal law, intercepts of lottery winnings under section 313.321, and collection efforts as provided for in sections 288.160, 288.170, and 288.175.\n\n15.

Shared work program created — definitions — plan, requirements — plan denied, submission of new plan, when — contribution by employer, how computed — benefits — severability clause. —1. There is created under this section a voluntary \"Shared Work Unemployment Compensation Program\". In connection therewith, the division may adopt rules and establish procedures, not inconsistent with this section, which are necessary to administer this program.\n\n2. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Affected unit\", a specified department, shift, or other unit of three or more employees which is designated by an employer to participate in a shared work plan;\n\n(2)\"Division\", the division of employment security;\n\n(3)\"Fringe benefit\", health insurance, a retirement benefit received under a defined benefit pension plan, as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, or contributions under a defined contribution plan, as defined in Section 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, a paid vacation day, a paid holiday, sick leave, and any other analogous employee benefit that is provided by an employer;\n\n(4)\"Normal weekly hours of work\", as to any individual, the lesser of forty hours or the average obtained by dividing the total number of hours worked per week in the preceding twelve-week period by the number twelve;\n\n(5)\"Participating employee\", an employee who works a reduced number of hours under a shared work plan;\n\n(6)\"Participating employer\", an employer who has a shared work plan in effect;\n\n(7)\"Shared work benefit\", an unemployment compensation benefit that is payable to an individual in an affected unit because the individual works reduced hours under an approved shared work plan;\n\n(8)\"Shared work plan\", a program for reducing unemployment under which employees who are members of an affected unit share the work remaining after a reduction in their normal weekly hours of work;\n\n(9)\"Shared work unemployment compensation program\", a program designed to reduce unemployment and stabilize the work force by allowing certain employees to collect unemployment compensation benefits if the employees share the work remaining after a reduction in the total number of hours of work and a corresponding reduction in wages.\n\n3. An employer who wishes to participate in the shared work unemployment compensation program established under this section shall submit a written shared work plan in a form acceptable to the division for approval. As a condition for approval by the division, a participating employer shall agree to furnish the division with reports relating to the operation of the shared work plan as requested by the division. The employer shall monitor and evaluate the operation of the established shared work plan as requested by the division and shall report the findings to the division.\n\n4. The division may approve a shared work plan if:\n\n(1) The employer has filed all reports required to be filed under this chapter for all past and current periods and has paid all contributions due for all past and current periods;\n\n(2) The shared work plan applies to and identifies a specified affected unit;\n\n(3) The employees in the affected unit are identified by name and Social Security number;\n\n(4) The shared work plan reduces the normal weekly hours of work for an employee in the affected unit by not less than twenty percent and not more than forty percent;\n\n(5) The shared work plan applies to at least ten percent of the employees in the affected unit;\n\n(6) The employer certifies that, if the participating employer provides fringe benefits, as defined in this section, to any employee in the affected unit, such benefits shall continue to be provided to employees participating in the shared work unemployment compensation program under the same terms and conditions as though the normal weekly hours of work had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the shared work unemployment compensation program;\n\n(7) The employer certifies that the implementation of a shared work plan and the resulting reduction in work hours is in lieu of layoffs that would affect at least ten percent of the employees in the affected unit and that would result in an equivalent reduction in work hours;\n\n(8) The shared work plan includes an estimate of the number of employees who would be laid off if the employer does not participate in the shared work unemployment compensation program;\n\n(9) The shared work plan describes the manner in which employees in the affected unit will be notified of the employer's participation in the shared work unemployment compensation program. If the employer will not provide advance notice to the employees in the affected unit, the shared work plan must contain a statement explaining why it is not feasible to provide advance notice;\n\n(10) The employer certifies that participation in the shared work plan and its implementation is consistent with the employer's obligation under applicable federal and state laws; and\n\n(11) The shared work plan includes any other provision that the United States Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate for the purpose of a shared work unemployment compensation program.\n\n5. If any of the employees who participate in a shared work plan under this section are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the shared work plan shall be approved in writing by the collective bargaining agent.\n\n6. No shared work plan which will subsidize seasonal employers during the off-season shall be approved by the division. No shared work plan benefits will be initiated when the reduced hours coincide with holiday earnings already committed to be paid by the employer. Shared work plan benefits may not be denied in any week containing a holiday for which holiday earnings are committed to be paid by the employer unless the shared work benefits to be paid are for the same hours in the same day as the holiday earnings.\n\n7. The division shall approve or deny a shared work plan not later than the thirtieth day after the day on which the shared work plan is received by the division. The division shall approve or deny a plan in writing. If the division denies a plan, the division shall notify the employer of the reasons for the denial. Approval or denial of a plan by the division shall be final and such determination shall be subject to review in the manner otherwise provided by law. If approval of a plan is denied by the division, the employer may submit a new plan to the division for consideration no sooner than forty-five calendar days following the date on which the division disapproved the employer's previously submitted plan.\n\n8. The division may revoke approval of a shared work plan and terminate the plan if it determines that the shared work plan is not being executed according to the terms and intent of the shared work unemployment compensation program, or if it is determined by the division that the approval of the shared work plan was based, in whole or in part, upon information contained in the plan which was either false or substantially misleading.\n\n9. Each shared work plan approved by the division shall become effective on the first day of the week in which it is approved by the division or on a later date as specified in the shared work plan. Each shared work plan approved by the division shall expire on the last day of the twelfth full calendar month after the effective date of such shared work plan.\n\n10. An employer may modify a shared work plan created under this section to meet changed conditions if the modification conforms to the basic provisions of the shared work plan as originally approved by the division. The employer shall report the changes made to the plan in writing to the division at least seven days before implementing such changes. The division shall reevaluate the shared work plan and may approve the modified shared work plan if it meets the requirements for approval under subsection 4 of this section. The approval of a modified shared work plan shall not, under any circumstances, affect the expiration date originally set for the shared work plan. If modifications cause the shared work plan to fail to meet the requirements for approval, the division shall deny approval of the modifications as provided in subsection 7 of this section.\n\n11. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an individual is unemployed for the purposes of this section in any week in which the individual, as an employee in an affected unit, works less than his normal weekly hours of work in accordance with an approved shared work plan in effect for that week.\n\n12. An individual who is otherwise entitled to receive regular unemployment insurance benefits under this chapter shall be eligible to receive shared work benefits with respect to any week in which the division finds that:\n\n(1) The individual is employed as a member of an affected unit subject to a shared work plan that was approved before the week in question and is in effect for that week;\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 288.040, the individual is able to work and available for his or her normal hours of work with the participating employer;\n\n(3) The individual's normal weekly hours of work have been reduced by at least twenty percent but not more than forty percent, with a corresponding reduction in wages; and\n\n(4) The individual has served a waiting week as defined in section 288.030.\n\n13. A waiting week served under the provisions of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 288.040 shall serve to meet the requirements of subdivision (4) of subsection 12 of this section and a waiting week served under the provisions of subdivision (4) of subsection 12 of this section shall serve to meet the requirements of section 288.040. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an individual who files a new initial claim during the pendency of the twelve-month period in which a shared work plan is in effect shall serve a waiting week whether or not the individual has served a waiting week under this subsection.\n\n14. The division shall not deny shared work benefits for any week to an otherwise eligible individual by reason of the application of any provision of this chapter that relates to availability for work, active search for work, refusal to apply for or accept work with an employer other than the participating employer under the plan, or training that is approved by the director, as provided in section 288.055, such as employer-sponsored training or training funded under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\n\n15. The division shall pay an individual who is eligible for shared work benefits under this section a weekly shared work benefit amount equal to the individual's regular weekly benefit amount for a period of total unemployment less any deductible amounts under this chapter except wages received from any employer, multiplied by the full percentage of reduction in the individual's hours as set forth in the employer's shared work plan. If the shared work benefit amount calculated under this subsection is not a multiple of one dollar, the division shall round the amount so calculated to the next lowest multiple of one dollar.\n\n16. An individual shall not be entitled to receive shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits in an aggregate amount which exceeds the maximum total amount of benefits payable to that individual in a benefit year as provided under section 288.060. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an individual shall not be eligible to receive shared work benefits for more than fifty-two calendar weeks during the twelve-month period of the shared work plan. No week shall be counted as a week of unemployment for the purposes of this subsection unless it occurs within the twelve-month period of the shared work plan.\n\n17. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, all benefits paid under a shared work plan which are chargeable to the participating employer or any other base period employer shall be charged to employers in the same manner as regular unemployment benefits are chargeable under this chapter.\n\n18. An individual who has received all of the shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits available in a benefit year is an exhaustee under section 288.062 and is entitled to receive extended benefits under section 288.062 if the individual is otherwise eligible under that section.\n\n19. If the United States Secretary of Labor determines any provision of this section to be nonconforming with federal law, the nonconforming provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this section.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 153, A.L. 1988 S.B. 455, A.L. 1989 S.B. 351, A.L. 1993 H.B. 502, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1268 & 1211, A.L. 2006 H.B. 1456, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1544, A.L. 2014 S.B. 844)\n\nEffective 6-27-14",

Extension of benefits — alternate base period defined — use of federal moneys. —Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary:\n\n(1) If a claimant does not have sufficient wages in the base period to be an insured worker, as those terms are defined in section 288.030, the individual's base period shall be the four most recently completed calendar quarters preceding the first day of the individual's benefit year. Such base period shall be known as the\"alternate base period\". If information as to wages for the most recent quarter of the alternate base period is not available to the deputy from the regular quarterly reports of wage information, which are systematically accessible, the deputy may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the affidavit of the claimant with respect to wages for that calendar quarter. The claimant shall furnish payroll documentation, where available, in support of the affidavit. The determination based upon the alternate base period as it relates to the claimant's benefit rights shall be amended if the quarterly report of wage information from the employer is timely received and that information causes a change in the determination. No calendar quarter in a base period or alternate base period for a claimant's current benefit year shall be used to establish a subsequent benefit year;\n\n(2) The claimant shall not be disqualified from unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that separation is for any compelling family reason. For the purposes of this section, the term\"compelling family reason\"shall mean:\n\n(a) The illness or disability of a member of the claimant's immediate family, which shall include the claimant's spouse, parent, or minor child under the age of eighteen;\n\n(b) The need for the claimant to accompany such claimant's spouse to a location from which it is impractical for the claimant to commute and due to a change in location of the spouse's employment;\n\n(c) Domestic violence, verified by reasonable and confidential documentation, which causes the claimant reasonably to believe that the claimant's continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the claimant or of any member of the claimant's family, as defined by the United States Secretary of Labor;\n\n(3) A claimant who has commenced training under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, or director-approved training under section 288.055, and has exhausted the claimant's regular unemployment benefits shall be eligible for additional unemployment benefits, not to exceed twenty-six times the claimant's weekly benefit amount. The weekly benefit amount shall be the same as the claimant's regular weekly benefit amount and shall be paid under the same terms and conditions as regular benefits. These training benefits shall be paid after any extended benefits or any similar benefits paid by a federally funded program;\n\n(4) Priority for training funds provided under subdivision (3) of this section shall be given to claimants laid off through no fault of their own from Missouri automobile manufacturing facilities;\n\n(5) No charges shall be made against an employer's account in respect to benefits paid to a claimant under this section;\n\n(6) The director shall separately track payments that were made under this section. Once the amount of payments exceeds the amount of federal incentive funds made available because of the enactment of this section, the unemployment compensation fund shall be reimbursed from general revenue for all subsequent payments to the claimants;\n\n*(7) The provisions of this section shall be subject to renewal in the second regular session of the ninety-fifth general assembly. If not renewed, the provisions of this section shall expire once the funds provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are expended as provided in this section;\n\n*(8) The provisions of this section shall not take effect, and no benefits paid under this section, unless first certified by the United States Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. 1103, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\n(L. 2009 H.B. 1075)\n\nEffective 6-12-09\n\n*Subdivision (8) contains a contingent effective date.
