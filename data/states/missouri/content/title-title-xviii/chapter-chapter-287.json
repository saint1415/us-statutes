Citation of law. —This chapter shall be known as \"The Workers' Compensation Law\".\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3689, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3299\n\n(1960) Defenses that injuries to employee were subject to workmen's compensation law and that plaintiff was estopped to sue by accepting benefits cannot be raised by motion to dismiss but should be asserted by answer. Roberts v. Epicure Foods Co. (Mo.), 330 S.W.2d 837.\n\n(1960) Fact that employee who is required to work in place where she necessarily inhaled noxious fumes with the result that she contracted pulmonary emphysema did not render the workmen's compensation law of Missouri inapplicable to her injury. Common law action for negligence of employer dismissed. Oggesen v. General Cable Corp., 273 F.2d 331.\n\n(1962) Where maintenance man in attempting to unlock a perforating machine placed a pipe over wrench handle and bounced up and down on end of pipe thereby sustaining back injury, the injury was an accident and compensable. Brotherton v. International Shoe Company (A.), 360 S.W.2d 108.\n\n(1962) Evidence supported finding claimant as result of fall suffered fifteen percent permanent partial disability of left arm where elbow was enlarged and would tire during the day although there was no loss of motion and claimant suffered no loss of earnings. Franklin v. St. Louis Independent Packing Company (A.), 360 S.W.2d 350.\n\n(1963) Evidence was sufficient to justify finding of industrial commission that claimant sustained an accident when he slipped on floor and twisted his back while holding a sixty-pound sack of sugar and fell resulting in injuries to his lower back notwithstanding his medical testimony was only to the effect that it was possible that the accident resulted in the back injury. Smith v. Terminal Transfer Company (A.), 372 S.W.2d 659.\n\n(1967) Where employee was injured in automobile accident while on the way to work in transportation furnished by the employer, the transportation was an implied term of and within the scope of the employment contract, and the accident arose out of and in the course of employee's employment. Griffin v. Ross (A.), 411 S.W.2d 649.\n\n(1967) An accidental injury \"arises out of\" employment only when there is a causal connection between the employee's injury and his employment, and a claimant meets this requirement only when the injury is the rational consequence of an act incidental to his employment. Blatt v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (A.), 413 S.W.2d 533.\n\n(1967) A showing that claimant's job involved pulling two hundred and fifty pound car loaded with staves onto a skid and was done intentionally in accordance with preconceived design and that nothing unusual occurred other than claimant feeling a pain was not sufficient evidence to sustain the burden of proof that claimant had experienced an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. Bauer v. Independent Stave Co. (A.), 417 S.W.2d 693.\n\n(1968) Driver hired by delivery service to work exclusively on hauling for cooperage company, under the direction and control of cooperage company, was employee of cooperage company for workmen's compensation purposes. Feldmann v. Dot Delivery Service (A.), 425 S.W.2d 491.\n\n(1980) Exclusive remedy of parents of deceased worker for compensation for alleged wrongful death of worker in employment accident under Workers' Compensation Law; overruling Miller v. Hotel Savoy Co. (A.), 68 S.W.2d 929. Combs v. City of Maryville (A.), 609 S.W.2d 475.\n\n(1991) Where worker alleges wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress, Missouri's workers' compensation law provides exclusive remedy for emotional distress inflicted during course of employment. Waldermeyer v. ITT Consumer Financial Corp., 767 F.Supp. 989 (E.D. Mo.).\n\n(1993) Where employee alleged former employer invaded her privacy because there was peep hole between her bathroom and supervisors' bathroom, court ruled that in all instances where an injured person seeks to hold employer liable under any common law tort theory, including intentional torts, for injuries resulting from work experiences, Labor and Industrial Relations Commission has exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine whether injuries are result of an accident covered by workers' compensation. Massey v. Victor I. Phillips Co., 827 F.Supp. 597 (W.D. Mo.).\n\n(1993) Where police officer alleged intentional torts by city and by co-employees individually, claim against city was barred by workers' compensation act; however, claims against individual co-employees, including police chief, were not barred by workers' compensation act. Russell v. City of Overland Police Dept., 838 F.Supp 1350 (E.D. Mo.).\n\n(1993) Where claimant who was employed by company based in Jefferson City was traveling home from job site at Lake of the Ozarks with saw belonging to company in car, travel did not serve mutual benefit and dual purpose doctrine did not apply. Accident did not occur on employer's premises or at work site; therefore, claim did not fall within workers' compensation act. Stockman v. J.C. Industries, Inc., 854 S.W.2d 24 (Mo. App. W.D.).",

      "text": "Title XVIII LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nChapter 287\n\n287.020. Definitions — intent to abrogate earlier case law. —1. The word\"employee\"as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean every person in the service of any employer, as defined in this chapter, under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, or under any appointment or election, including executive officers of corporations. Except as otherwise provided in section 287.200, any reference to any employee who has been injured shall, when the employee is dead, also include his or her dependents, and other persons to whom compensation may be payable. The word \"employee\" shall also include all minors who work for an employer, whether or not such minors are employed in violation of law, and all such minors are hereby made of full age for all purposes under, in connection with, or arising out of this chapter. The word \"employee\" shall not include an individual who is the owner, as defined in section 301.010, and operator of a motor vehicle which is leased or contracted with a driver to a for-hire motor carrier operating within a commercial zone as defined in section 390.020 or 390.041, or operating under a certificate issued by the Missouri department of transportation or by the United States Department of Transportation, or any of its subagencies. The word \"employee\" also shall not include any person performing services for board, lodging, aid, or sustenance received from any religious, charitable, or relief organization.\n\n2. The word\"accident\"as used in this chapter shall mean an unexpected traumatic event or unusual strain identifiable by time and place of occurrence and producing at the time objective symptoms of an injury caused by a specific event during a single work shift. An injury is not compensable because work was a triggering or precipitating factor.\n\n3. (1) In this chapter the term\"injury\"is hereby defined to be an injury which has arisen out of and in the course of employment. An injury by accident is compensable only if the accident was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability.\"The prevailing factor\"is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability.\n\n(2) An injury shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment only if:\n\n(a) It is reasonably apparent, upon consideration of all the circumstances, that the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the injury; and\n\n(b) It does not come from a hazard or risk unrelated to the employment to which workers would have been equally exposed outside of and unrelated to the employment in normal nonemployment life.\n\n(3) An injury resulting directly or indirectly from idiopathic causes is not compensable.\n\n(4) A cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, or other disease, or cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction suffered by a worker is an injury only if the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the resulting medical condition.\n\n(5) The terms\"injury\"and\"personal injuries\"shall mean violence to the physical structure of the body and to the personal property which is used to make up the physical structure of the body, such as artificial dentures, artificial limbs, glass eyes, eyeglasses, and other prostheses which are placed in or on the body to replace the physical structure and such disease or infection as naturally results therefrom. These terms shall in no case except as specifically provided in this chapter be construed to include occupational disease in any form, nor shall they be construed to include any contagious or infectious disease contracted during the course of the employment, nor shall they include death due to natural causes occurring while the worker is at work.\n\n4.\"Death\"when mentioned as a basis for the right to compensation means only death resulting from such violence and its resultant effects occurring within three hundred weeks after the accident; except that in cases of occupational disease, the limitation of three hundred weeks shall not be applicable.\n\n5. Injuries sustained in company-owned or subsidized automobiles in accidents that occur while traveling from the employee's home to the employer's principal place of business or from the employer's principal place of business to the employee's home are not compensable. The extension of premises doctrine is abrogated to the extent it extends liability for accidents that occur on property not owned or controlled by the employer even if the accident occurs on customary, approved, permitted, usual or accepted routes used by the employee to get to and from their place of employment.\n\n6. The term\"total disability\"as used in this chapter shall mean inability to return to any employment and not merely mean inability to return to the employment in which the employee was engaged at the time of the accident.\n\n7. As used in this chapter and all acts amendatory thereof, the term\"commission\"shall hereafter be construed as meaning and referring exclusively to the labor and industrial relations commission of Missouri, and the term\"director\"shall hereafter be construed as meaning the director of the department of commerce and insurance of the state of Missouri or such agency of government as shall exercise the powers and duties now conferred and imposed upon the department of commerce and insurance of the state of Missouri.\n\n8. The term\"division\"as used in this chapter means the division of workers' compensation of the department of labor and industrial relations of the state of Missouri.\n\n9. For the purposes of this chapter, the term\"minor\"means a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years; except that, for the purpose of computing the compensation provided for in this chapter, the provisions of section 287.250 shall control.\n\n10. In applying the provisions of this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature to reject and abrogate earlier case law interpretations on the meaning of or definition of \"accident\", \"occupational disease\", \"arising out of\", and \"in the course of the employment\" to include, but not be limited to, holdings in: Bennett v. Columbia Health Care and Rehabilitation, 80 S.W.3d 524 (Mo.App. W.D. 2002); Kasl v. Bristol Care, Inc., 984 S.W.2d 852 (Mo.banc 1999); and Drewes v. TWA, 984 S.W.2d 512 (Mo.banc 1999) and all cases citing, interpreting, applying, or following those cases.\n\n11. For the purposes of this chapter,\"occupational diseases due to toxic exposure\"shall only include the following: mesothelioma, asbestosis, berylliosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, brochiolitis obliterans, silicosis, silicotuberculosis, manganism, acute myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\n12. For the purposes of this chapter,\"maximum medical improvement\"shall mean the point at which the injured employee's medical condition has stabilized and can no longer reasonably improve with additional medical care, as determined within a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3695, § 3744, A.L. 1945 p. 1996 (§ 3744), A.L. 1947 V. II p. 438 (§ 3695), A.L. 1959 S.B. 167, A.L. 1963 p. 408, A.L. 1967 p. 384, A.L. 1974 S.B. 417, A.L. 1977 S.B. 49, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1260, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396, A.L. 1981 H.B. 324, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1883, A.L. 2013 S.B. 1, A.L. 2017 S.B. 8 merged with S.B. 66 merged with S.B. 222 merged with S.B. 225)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 §§ 3305, 3354\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nDivision of motor carrier and railroad safety abolished, duties and functions transferred to highways and transportation commission and department of transportation, 226.008\n\n(1967) The definition of the word \"accident\" is broad enough to include an unusual or abnormal strain, but a back injury suffered in course of usual work where no abnormal or unusual strain contributed to injury was not an accident. Mason v. F.W. Strecker Transfer Company (A.), 409 S.W.2d 267.\n\n(1971) Inhalation of paint dust and paint fumes for a period of over three years by person employed as sander and spray painter of dispensing machines, and resulting effect on his body and lungs, including aggravation of preexisting condition of tuberculosis held not an \"accident\" under this section. Bess v. Coca-Cola Bottling Company of St. Louis (A.), 469 S.W.2d 40.\n\n(1973) Held that unusual abnormal and continuous physical and mental strain sustained by over-the-road truck driver constituted an \"accident\" within the meaning of the workmen's compensation statute. Snugges v. Steel Haulers, Inc. (Mo.) 501 S.W.2d 481.\n\n(1974) Held that where workman was found dying after he had unloaded cargo in his normal job there was no presumption of accident. A heart attack is not \"accidental\" unless it results from unusual exertion and strain. It is incumbent on plaintiffs to produce affirmative evidence of accident. Russell v. Southwest Grease and Oil Co. (A.), 509 S.W.2d 776.\n\nCourse of Employment\n\n(1965) Words \"arising out of\" refer to the origin or cause of the accident and are descriptive of its character, while words \"in the course of\" refer to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident takes place. Kammeyer v. Board of Education (A.), 393 S.W.2d 122.\n\n(1969) Volunteer working at hospital without pay was an employee within meaning of employee \"under any appointment or election\" in this section. Orphant v. St. Louis State Hospital, Division of Mental Diseases (Mo.), 441 S.W.2d 355.\n\n(1977) Sole proprietor of unincorporated business is not an \"employee\" and is not eligible for benefits for injury received while performing duties normally performed by an employee. Bethel v. Sunlight Janitor Service (Mo.), 551 S.W.2d 616.\n\nOccupational Disease\n\n(1983) Liberally construing the term \"accident\" as used in the Workers' Compensation Act, so long as an injury is clearly job related, it is compensable. Wolfgeher v. Wagner Cartage Service, Inc. (Mo. banc), 646 S.W.2d 781.",

Occupational disease defined — repetitive motion, loss of hearing, radiation injury, communicable disease, others — posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). —1. In this chapter the term\"occupational disease\"is hereby defined to mean, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context, an identifiable disease arising with or without human fault out of and in the course of the employment. Ordinary diseases of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall not be compensable, except where the diseases follow as an incident of an occupational disease as defined in this section. The disease need not to have been foreseen or expected but after its contraction it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\n\n2. An injury or death by occupational disease is compensable only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. The\"prevailing factor\"is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable.\n\n3. An injury due to repetitive motion is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this chapter. An occupational disease due to repetitive motion is compensable only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. The\"prevailing factor\"is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable.\n\n4.\"Loss of hearing due to industrial noise\"is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this chapter and is hereby defined to be a loss of hearing in one or both ears due to prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment.\"Harmful noise\"means sound capable of producing occupational deafness.\n\n5.\"Radiation disability\"is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this chapter and is hereby defined to be that disability due to radioactive properties or substances or to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or exposure to ionizing radiation caused by any process involving the use of or direct contact with radium or radioactive properties or substances or the use of or direct exposure to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or ionizing radiation.\n\n6. Disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, hypotension, hypertension, or disease of the heart or cardiovascular system, including carcinoma, may be recognized as occupational diseases for the purposes of this chapter and are defined to be disability due to exposure to smoke, gases, carcinogens, inadequate oxygen, of paid firefighters of a paid fire department or paid police officers of a paid police department certified under chapter 590 if a direct causal relationship is established, or psychological stress of firefighters of a paid fire department or paid peace officers of a police department who are certified under chapter 590 if a direct causal relationship is established.\n\n7. Any employee who is exposed to and contracts any contagious or communicable disease arising out of and in the course of his or her employment shall be eligible for benefits under this chapter as an occupational disease.\n\n8. With regard to occupational disease due to repetitive motion, if the exposure to the repetitive motion which is found to be the cause of the injury is for a period of less than three months and the evidence demonstrates that the exposure to the repetitive motion with the immediate prior employer was the prevailing factor in causing the injury, the prior employer shall be liable for such occupational disease.\n\n9. (1) (a) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, Fifth Edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association, (DSM-5) is recognized as a compensable occupational disease for purposes of this chapter when diagnosed in a first responder, as that term is defined under section 67.145.\n\n(b) Benefits payable to a first responder under this section shall not require a physical injury to the first responder, and are not subject to any preexisting PTSD.\n\n(c) Benefits payable to a first responder under this section are compensable only if demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that PTSD has resulted from the course and scope of employment, and the first responder is examined and diagnosed with PTSD by an authorized treating physician, due to the first responder experiencing one of the following qualifying events:\n\na. Seeing for oneself a deceased minor;\n\nb. Witnessing directly the death of a minor;\n\nc. Witnessing directly the injury to a minor who subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a hospital emergency department, participating in the physical treatment of, or manually transporting, an injured minor who subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a hospital emergency department;\n\nd. Seeing for oneself a person who has suffered serious physical injury of a nature that shocks the conscience;\n\ne. Witnessing directly a death, including suicide, due to serious physical injury; or homicide, including murder, mass killings, manslaughter, self-defense, misadventure, and negligence;\n\nf. Witnessing directly an injury that results in death, if the person suffered serious physical injury that shocks the conscience;\n\ng. Participating in the physical treatment of an injury, including attempted suicide, or manually transporting an injured person who suffered serious physical injury, if the injured person subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a hospital emergency department; or\n\nh. Involvement in an event that caused or may have caused serious injury or harm to the first responder or had the potential to cause the death of the first responder, whether accidental or by an intentional act of another individual.\n\n(2) The time for notice of injury or death in cases of compensable PTSD under this section is measured from exposure to one of the qualifying stressors listed in the DSM-5 criteria, or the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later. Any claim for compensation for such injury shall be properly noticed within fifty-two weeks after the qualifying exposure, or the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later.\n\n(L. 1959 S.B. 167 § 287.201, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396, A.L. 1983 H.B. 243 & 260, A.L. 1987 H.B. 564, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130, A.L. 2013 H.B. 404 & 614 merged with S.B. 1, A.L. 2023 S.B. 24 merged with S.B. 186)\n\n(1972) Whether a disease is occupational is not to be determined by whether the disease is literally peculiar to an occupation, but whether there is a recognizable link between the disease and some distinctive feature of the claimant's job which is common to all jobs of that sort.

Every employer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable, irrespective of negligence, to furnish compensation under the provisions of this chapter for personal injury or death of the employee by accident or occupational disease arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment.

The forfeiture of benefits or compensation shall not apply when:\n\n(1) The employee was directly ordered by the employer to participate in such recreational activity or program;\n\n(2) The employee was paid wages or travel expenses while participating in such recreational activity or program; or\n\n(3) The injury from such recreational activity or program occurs on the employer's premises due to an unsafe condition and the employer had actual knowledge of the employee's participation in the recreational activity or program and of the unsafe condition of the premises and failed to either curtail the recreational activity or program or cure the unsafe condition.\n\n8. Mental injury resulting from work-related stress does not arise out of and in the course of the employment, unless it is demonstrated that the stress is work related and was extraordinary and unusual. The amount of work stress shall be measured by objective standards and actual events.\n\n9. A mental injury is not considered to arise out of and in the course of the employment if it resulted from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff, demotion, termination or any similar action taken in good faith by the employer.\n\n10. The ability of a firefighter to receive benefits for psychological stress under section 287.067 shall not be diminished by the provisions of subsections 8 and 9 of this section.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3691, A.L. 1965 p. 397, A.L. 1969 H.B. 367, A.L. 1974 S.B. 417, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1260, A.L. 1990 S.B. 751, A.L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1540, A.L. 2013 S.B. 1, A.L. 2017 S.B. 66)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3301\n\nAccident, Injury\n\n(1998) Injuries which occur while traveling to and from medical treatment for prior compensation injuries do not arise out of and in the course of employment and, as such, are not compensable. Bear v. Anson Implement Inc., 976 S.W.2d 553 (W.D.Mo.), transfer denied.\n\n(1998) The Division of Workers' Compensation has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over claims of medical malpractice for post-accident injuries alleged to be caused by treatment of an injury falling under the purview of workers' compensation law because such claims are sufficiently work-related to arise out of and in the course of employment. Burns v. Employer Health Services, Inc., 976 S.W.2d 639 (W.D.Mo.).\n\nExclusive Remedy\n\n(1980) Exclusive remedy of parents of deceased worker for compensation for alleged wrongful death of worker in employment accident under Workers' Compensation Law; overruling Miller v. Hotel Savoy Co. (A.), 68 S.W.2d 929. Combs v. City of Maryville (A.), 609 S.W.2d 475.\n\n(1984) Exclusive remedy provision of Workers' Compensation Act is not a bar to a common law action against a parent or subsidiary corporation of the plaintiff's immediate employer. Boswell v. May Centers, Inc. (Mo. App.), 669 S.W.2d 585.\n\n(1996) Statute's exclusivity provision does not bar recovery of damages under the Missouri Human Rights Act. Varner v. National Super Markets, Inc., 94 F.3d 1209 (8th Cir.).\n\nThird Party Actions\n\n(1985) An employer is not subject to third-party actions for contribution or assessment of fault with respect to an employee's accident covered under the Workers' Compensation Act. Redford v. R.A.F., Corp., 615 F.Supp. 547 (D.C.Mo.).\n\n(1989) Where contract required subcontractor to defend and indemnify general contractor in claims arising out of performance of the contract, workers' compensation statute does not shield subcontractor from liability for breach of independent contractual duty to indemnify general contractor. U.S. v. Fru-Con Construction Corp. (8th Cir.) 890 F.2d 1046.\n\n(1991) Workers' compensation statutes do not bar an action by a third party for indemnity against an employer when employer breaches an independent duty or obligation to third party. Independent duty of due care is created when employer participates in design of machinery in intrusive or specific way and constitutes an exception to the exclusive remedy of workers' compensation statutes.

In case of a medical examination if a dispute arises as to what expenses shall be paid by the employer, the matter shall be presented to the legal advisor, the administrative law judge or the commission, who shall set the sum to be paid and same shall be paid by the employer prior to the medical examination. In no event, however, shall the employer or its insurer be required to pay transportation costs for a greater distance than two hundred fifty miles each way from place of treatment.\n\n2. If it be shown to the division or the commission that the requirements are being furnished in such manner that there is reasonable ground for believing that the life, health, or recovery of the employee is endangered thereby, the division or the commission may order a change in the physician, surgeon, hospital or other requirement.\n\n3. All fees and charges under this chapter shall be fair and reasonable, shall be subject to regulation by the division or the commission, or the board of rehabilitation in rehabilitation cases. A health care provider shall not charge a fee for treatment and care which is governed by the provisions of this chapter greater than the usual and customary fee the provider receives for the same treatment or service when the payor for such treatment or service is a private individual or a private health insurance carrier. The division or the commission, or the board of rehabilitation in rehabilitation cases, shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine all disputes as to such charges. A health care provider is bound by the determination upon the reasonableness of health care bills.\n\n4. The division shall, by regulation, establish methods to resolve disputes concerning the reasonableness of medical charges, services, or aids. This regulation shall govern resolution of disputes between employers and medical providers over fees charged, whether or not paid, and shall be in lieu of any other administrative procedure under this chapter. The employee shall not be a party to a dispute over medical charges, nor shall the employee's recovery in any way be jeopardized because of such dispute. Any application for payment of additional reimbursement, as such term is used in 8 CSR 50- 2.030, as amended, shall be filed not later than:\n\n(1) Two years from the date the first notice of dispute of the medical charge was received by the health care provider if such services were rendered before July 1, 2013; and\n\n(2) One year from the date the first notice of dispute of the medical charge was received by the health care provider if such services were rendered after July 1, 2013.­­Notice shall be presumed to occur no later than five business days after transmission by certified United States mail.\n\n­­Notice shall be presumed to occur no later than five business days after transmission by certified United States mail.\n\n5. No compensation shall be payable for the death or disability of an employee, if and insofar as the death or disability may be caused, continued or aggravated by any unreasonable refusal to submit to any medical or surgical treatment or operation, the risk of which is, in the opinion of the division or the commission, inconsiderable in view of the seriousness of the injury. If the employee dies as a result of an operation made necessary by the injury, the death shall be deemed to be caused by the injury.\n\n6. The testimony of any physician or chiropractic physician who treated the employee shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for compensation under this chapter, subject to all of the provisions of section 287.210.\n\n7. Every hospital or other person furnishing the employee with medical aid shall permit its record to be copied by and shall furnish full information to the division or the commission, the employer, the employee or his dependents and any other party to any proceedings for compensation under this chapter, and certified copies of the records shall be admissible in evidence in any such proceedings.\n\n8. The employer may be required by the division or the commission to furnish an injured employee with artificial legs, arms, hands, surgical orthopedic joints, or eyes, or braces, as needed, for life whenever the division or the commission shall find that the injured employee may be partially or wholly relieved of the effects of a permanent injury by the use thereof. The director of the division shall establish a procedure whereby a claim for compensation may be reactivated after settlement of such claim is completed. The claim shall be reactivated only after the claimant can show good cause for the reactivation of this claim and the claim shall be made only for the payment of medical procedures involving life-threatening surgical procedures or if the claimant requires the use of a new, or the modification, alteration or exchange of an existing, prosthetic device. For the purpose of this subsection,\"life threatening\"shall mean a situation or condition which, if not treated immediately, will likely result in the death of the injured worker.\n\n9. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an employee being provided treatment for his injuries by prayer or spiritual means if the employer does not object to the treatment.\n\n10. The employer shall have the right to select the licensed treating physician, surgeon, chiropractic physician, or other health care provider; provided, however, that such physicians, surgeons or other health care providers shall offer only those services authorized within the scope of their licenses. For the purpose of this subsection, subsection 2 of section 287.030 shall not apply.\n\n11. Any physician or other health care provider who orders, directs or refers a patient for treatment, testing, therapy or rehabilitation at any institution or facility shall, at or prior to the time of the referral, disclose in writing if such health care provider, any of his partners or his employer has a financial interest in the institution or facility to which the patient is being referred, to the following:\n\n(1) The patient;\n\n(2) The employer of the patient with workers' compensation liability for the injury or disease being treated;\n\n(3) The workers' compensation insurer of such employer; and\n\n(4) The workers' compensation adjusting company for such insurer.\n\n12. Violation of subsection 11 of this section is a class A misdemeanor.\n\n13. (1) No hospital, physician or other health care provider, other than a hospital, physician or health care provider selected by the employee at his own expense pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, shall bill or attempt to collect any fee or any portion of a fee for services rendered to an employee due to a work-related injury or report to any credit reporting agency any failure of the employee to make such payment, when an injury covered by this chapter has occurred and such hospital, physician or health care provider has received actual notice given in writing by the employee, the employer or the employer's insurer. Actual notice shall be deemed received by the hospital, physician or health care provider five days after mailing by certified mail by the employer or insurer to the hospital, physician or health care provider.\n\n(2) The notice shall include:\n\n(a) The name of the employer;\n\n(b) The name of the insurer, if known;\n\n(c) The name of the employee receiving the services;\n\n(d) The general nature of the injury, if known; and\n\n(e) Where a claim has been filed, the claim number, if known.\n\n(3) When an injury is found to be noncompensable under this chapter, the hospital, physician or other health care provider shall be entitled to pursue the employee for any unpaid portion of the fee or other charges for authorized services provided to the employee. Any applicable statute of limitations for an action for such fees or other charges shall be tolled from the time notice is given to the division by a hospital, physician or other health care provider pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection, until a determination of noncompensability in regard to the injury which is the basis of such services is made, or in the event there is an appeal to the labor and industrial relations commission, until a decision is rendered by that commission.\n\n(4) If a hospital, physician or other health care provider or a debt collector on behalf of such hospital, physician or other health care provider pursues any action to collect from an employee after such notice is properly given, the employee shall have a cause of action against the hospital, physician or other health care provider for actual damages sustained plus up to one thousand dollars in additional damages, costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n(5) If an employer or insurer fails to make payment for authorized services provided to the employee by a hospital, physician or other health care provider pursuant to this chapter, the hospital, physician or other health care provider may proceed pursuant to subsection 4 of this section with a dispute against the employer or insurer for any fees or other charges for services provided.\n\n(6) A hospital, physician or other health care provider whose services have been authorized in advance by the employer or insurer may give notice to the division of any claim for fees or other charges for services provided for a work-related injury that is covered by this chapter, with copies of the notice to the employee, employer and the employer's insurer. Where such notice has been filed, the administrative law judge may order direct payment from the proceeds of any settlement or award to the hospital, physician or other health care provider for such fees as are determined by the division. The notice shall be on a form prescribed by the division.\n\n14. The employer may allow or require an employee to use any of the employee's accumulated paid leave, personal leave, or medical or sick leave to attend to medical treatment, physical rehabilitation, or medical evaluations during work time. The intent of this subsection is to specifically supercede and abrogate any case law that contradicts the express language of this section.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3701, A.L. 1951 p. 613, A.L. 1957 p. 560, A.L. 1959 S.B. 167, A.L. 1965 pp. 397, 413, A.L. 1977 S.B. 49, S.B. 399, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396, A.L. 1983 H.B. 243 & 260, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1277, A.L. 1990 S.B. 751, A.L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1237, et al., A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130, A.L. 2013 S.B. 1)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3311\n\nEffective 1-01-14\n\n(1987) Employer is liable for medical expenses incurred by claimant even though claimant selected her own medical providers and employer was not notified of need for medical treatment until expenses had been incurred where claimant did not know she had suffered a compensable injury until after physician advised by letter that employment was suspected of causing medical condition.

The purpose of this section is to restore the injured person as soon as possible and as nearly as possible to a condition of self-support and maintenance as an able-bodied worker by physical rehabilitation. The provisions of this chapter relating to physical rehabilitation shall be under the control of and administered by the director of the division of workers' compensation. The division of workers' compensation shall make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, subject to the approval of the labor and industrial relations commission of Missouri.\n\n2. The division of workers' compensation shall continuously study the problems of physical rehabilitation and shall investigate all rehabilitation facilities, both private and public, and upon such investigation shall approve as qualified all such facilities, institutions and physicians as are capable of rendering competent physical rehabilitation service for seriously injured industrial workers. Rehabilitation facilities shall include medical, surgical, hospital and physical restoration services. No facility or institution shall be considered as qualified unless it is equipped to provide physical rehabilitation services for persons suffering either from some specialized type of disability or general type of disability within the field of industrial injury, and unless such facility or institution is operated under the supervision of a physician qualified to render physical rehabilitation service and is staffed with trained and qualified personnel and has received a certificate of qualification from the division of workers' compensation. No physician shall be considered as qualified unless he has had the experience prescribed by the division.\n\n3. In any case of serious injury involving disability following the period of rendition of medical aid as provided by subsection 1 of section 287.140, where physical rehabilitation is necessary if the employer or insurer shall offer such physical rehabilitation to the injured employee and such physical rehabilitation is accepted by the employee, then in such case the director of the division of workers' compensation shall be immediately notified thereof and thereupon enter his approval to such effect, and the director of the division of workers' compensation shall requisition the payment of forty dollars per week benefit from the second injury fund in the state treasury to be paid to the employee while he is actually being rehabilitated, and shall immediately notify the state treasurer thereof by furnishing him with a copy of his order. But in no case shall the period of physical rehabilitation extend beyond twenty weeks except in unusual cases and then only by a special order of the division of workers' compensation for such additional period as the division may authorize.\n\n4. In all cases where physical rehabilitation is offered and accepted or ordered by the division, the employer or insurer shall have the right to select any physician, facility, or institution that has been found qualified by the division of workers' compensation as above set forth.\n\n5. If the parties disagree as to such physical rehabilitation treatment, where such treatment appears necessary, then either the employee, the employer, or insurer may file a request with the division of workers' compensation for an order for physical rehabilitation and the director of the division shall hear the parties within ten days after the filing of the request. The director of the division shall forthwith notify the parties of the time and place of the hearing, and the hearing shall be held at a place to be designated at the discretion of the division. The director of the division may conduct such hearing or he may direct one of the administrative law judges to conduct same. Such hearing shall be informal in all respects. The director of the division shall, after considering all evidence at such hearing, within ten days make his order in the matter, either denying such request or ordering the employer or insurer within a reasonable time, to furnish physical rehabilitation, and ordering the employee to accept the same, at the expense of the employer or insurer. When the order requires physical rehabilitation, it shall also include an order to requisition the payment of forty dollars per week out of the second injury fund in the state treasury to the injured employee during such time as such employee is actually receiving physical rehabilitation.\n\n6. In every case where physical rehabilitation shall be ordered, the director of the division may, in his discretion, order the employer or insurer to furnish transportation to the injured employee to such rehabilitation facility or institution.\n\n7. As used in this section, the term\"physical rehabilitation\"shall be deemed to include medical, surgical and hospital treatment in the same respect as required to be furnished under subsection 1 of section 287.140.\n\n8.

Whenever recovery against the third person is effected by the employee or his dependents, the employer shall pay from his share of the recovery a proportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee. After the expenses and attorney fee have been paid, the balance of the recovery shall be apportioned between the employer and the employee or his dependents in the same ratio that the amount due the employer bears to the total amount recovered if there is no finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee, or the total damages determined by the trier of fact if there is a finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the balance of the recovery may be divided between the employer and the employee or his dependents as they may otherwise agree. Any part of the recovery found to be due to the employer, the employee or his dependents shall be paid forthwith and any part of the recovery paid to the employee or his dependents under this section shall be treated by them as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future installments of compensation in the following manner:\n\n(1) The total amount paid to the employee or his dependents shall be treated as an advance payment if there is no finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee; or\n\n(2) A percentage of the amount paid to the employee or his dependents equal to the percentage of fault assessed to the third person from whom recovery is made shall be treated as an advance payment if there is a finding of comparative fault on the part of the employee.\n\n4. In any case in which an injured employee has been paid benefits from the second injury fund as provided in subsection 3 of section 287.141, and recovery is had against the third party liable to the employee for the injury, the second injury fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the employee against said third party to the extent of the payments made to him from such fund, subject to provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section.\n\n5. No construction design professional who is retained to perform professional services on a construction project or any employee of a construction design professional who is assisting or representing the construction design professional in the performance of professional services on the site of the construction project shall be liable for any injury resulting from the employer's failure to comply with safety standards on a construction project for which compensation is recoverable under the workers' compensation law, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent preparation of design plans or specifications.\n\n6. Any provision in any contract or subcontract, where one party is an employer in the construction group of code classifications, which purports to waive subrogation rights provided under this section in anticipation of a future injury or death is hereby declared against public policy and void. Each contract of insurance for workers' compensation shall require the insurer to diligently pursue all subrogation rights of the employer and shall require the employer to fully cooperate with the insurer in pursuing such recoveries, except that the employer may enter into compromise agreements with an insurer in lieu of the insurer pursuing subrogation against another party. The amount of any subrogation recovery by an insurer shall be credited against the amount of the actual paid losses in the determination of such employer's experience modification factor within forty-five days of the collection of such amount.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when a third person or party is liable to the employee, to the dependents of an employee, or to any person eligible to sue for the employee's*wrongful death as provided is section 537.080 in a case where the employee suffers or suffered from an occupational disease due to toxic exposure and the employee, dependents, or persons eligible to sue for wrongful death are compensated under this chapter, in no case shall the employer then be subrogated to the rights of an employee, dependents, or persons eligible to sue for wrongful death against such third person or party when the occupational disease due to toxic exposure arose from the employee's work for employer.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3699, A.L. 1955 p. 597, A.L. 1957 p. 560, A.L. 1990 S.B. 751, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130, A.L. 2013 S.B. 1)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3309\n\nEffective 1-01-14\n\n*Word \"employer's\" appears in original rolls, a typographical error.\n\n(1962) Employers and their workmen's compensation insurer could not recover, on theory of subrogation, amount of compensation paid injured employee from third party tort-feasor and his liability insurer who had settled with employee for amount in excess of compensation paid.

Losses of hearing due to industrial noise for compensation purposes shall be confined to the frequencies of five hundred, one thousand, and two thousand cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability for frequency tones above two thousand cycles per second are not to be considered as constituting disability for hearing.\n\n2. The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of the determination of compensation claims for occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of five hundred, one thousand, and two thousand cycles per second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric instruments, approved by nationally recognized authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average twenty-six decibels or less in the three frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not then constitute any compensable hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average ninety-two decibels or more in the three frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or one hundred percent compensable hearing loss. The decibel standards established by this subsection are based on the most current ANSI occupational hearing loss standard. The division shall, by rule, adopt any superseding ANSI occupational hearing loss standards regarding testing frequencies and decibel standards for measuring hearing loss.\n\n3. There shall be payable as permanent partial disability for total occupational deafness of one ear forty-nine weeks of compensation; for total occupational deafness of both ears, one hundred eighty weeks of compensation; and for partial occupational deafness in one or both ears, compensation shall be paid for such periods as are proportionate to the relation which the hearing loss bears to the amount provided in this subsection for total loss of hearing in one or both ears, as the case may be. The amount of the hearing loss shall be reduced by the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes found in the population at any given age, according to the provisions hereinafter set forth.\n\n4. In measuring hearing disability, the lowest measured losses in each of the three frequencies shall be added together and divided by three to determine the average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss exceeding twenty-six decibels an allowance of one and one-half percent shall be made up to the maximum of one hundred percent which is reached at ninety-two decibels.\n\n5. In determining the binaural (both ears) percentage of loss, the percentage of disability in the better ear shall be multiplied by five. The resulting figure shall be added to the percentage of disability in the poorer ear and the sum of the two divided by six. The final percentage shall represent the binaural hearing disability.\n\n6. Before determining the percentage of hearing disability, in order to allow for the average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes found in the population at any given age, there shall be deducted from the total average decibel loss, one-half decibel for each year of the employee's age over forty at the time of last exposure to industrial noise.\n\n7. No claim for compensation for occupational deafness may be filed until after one month's separation from the type of noisy work for the last employer in whose employment the employee was at any time during such employment exposed to harmful noise, and the last day of such period of separation from the type of noisy work shall be the date of disability.\n\n8. An employer shall become liable for the entire occupational deafness to which his employment has contributed; but if previous deafness is established by a hearing test or by other competent evidence, whether or not the employee was exposed to noise within one month preceding such test, the employer shall not be liable for previous loss so established nor shall he be liable for any loss for which compensation has previously been paid or awarded.\n\n9. No consideration shall be given to the question of whether or not the ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a hearing aid.\n\n(L. 1959 S.B. 167 § 287.202, A.L. 1967 p. 390, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1237, et al., A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)",

Permanent total disability, amount to be paid — suspension of payments, when — toxic exposure, treatment of claims. —1. Compensation for permanent total disability shall be paid during the continuance of such disability from the date of maximum medical improvement for the lifetime of the employee at the weekly rate of compensation in effect under this subsection on the date of the injury for which compensation is being made. The word\"employee\"as used in this section shall not include the injured worker's dependents, estate, or other persons to whom compensation may be payable as provided in subsection 1 of section 287.020. The amount of such compensation shall be computed as follows:\n\n(1) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1983, but before September 28, 1986, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury, as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July first immediately preceding the date of injury;\n\n(2) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1986, but before August 28, 1990, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury, as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy-five percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July first immediately preceding the date of injury;\n\n(3) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1990, but before August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred percent of the state average weekly wage;\n\n(4) For all injuries occurring on or after August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this subdivision shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred five percent of the state average weekly wage;\n\n(5) For all injuries occurring on or after September 28, 1981, the weekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars per week.\n\n2. Permanent total disability benefits that have accrued through the date of the injured employee's death are the only permanent total disability benefits that are to be paid in accordance with section 287.230. The right to unaccrued compensation for permanent total disability of an injured employee terminates on the date of the injured employee's death in accordance with section 287.230, and does not survive to the injured employee's dependents, estate, or other persons to whom compensation might otherwise be payable.\n\n3. All claims for permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the facts. When an injured employee receives an award for permanent total disability but by the use of glasses, prosthetic appliances, or physical rehabilitation the employee is restored to his or her regular work or its equivalent, the life payment mentioned in subsection 1 of this section shall be suspended during the time in which the employee is restored to his or her regular work or its equivalent. The employer and the division shall keep the file open in the case during the lifetime of any injured employee who has received an award of permanent total disability. In any case where the life payment is suspended under this subsection, the commission may at reasonable times review the case and either the employee or the employer may request an informal conference with the commission relative to the resumption of the employee's weekly life payment in the case.\n\n4. For all claims filed on or after January 1, 2014, for occupational diseases due to toxic exposure which result in a permanent total disability or death, benefits in this chapter shall be provided as follows:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, such amount as due to the employee during said employee's life as provided for under this chapter for an award of permanent total disability and death, except such amount shall only be paid when benefits under subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection have been exhausted;\n\n(2) For occupational diseases due to toxic exposure, but not including mesothelioma, an amount equal to two hundred percent of the state's average weekly wage as of the date of diagnosis for one hundred weeks paid by the employer; and\n\n(3) In cases where occupational diseases due to toxic exposure are diagnosed to be mesothelioma:\n\n*(a) For employers that have elected to accept mesothelioma liability under this subsection, an additional amount of three hundred percent of the state's average weekly wage for two hundred twelve weeks shall be paid by the employer or group of employers such employer is a member of. Employers that elect to accept mesothelioma liability under this subsection may do so by either insuring their liability, by qualifying as a self-insurer, or by becoming a member of a group insurance pool. A group of employers may enter into an agreement to pool their liabilities under this subsection. If such group is joined, individual members shall not be required to qualify as individual self-insurers. Such group shall comply with section 287.223. In order for an employer to make such an election, the employer shall provide the department with notice of such an election in a manner established by the department. The provisions of this paragraph shall expire on December 31, 2038; or\n\n*(b) For employers who reject mesothelioma under this subsection, then the exclusive remedy provisions under section 287.120 shall not apply to such liability. The provisions of this paragraph shall expire on December 31, 2038; and\n\n(4) The provisions of subdivision (2) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection shall not be subject to suspension of benefits as provided in subsection 3 of this section; and\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, should the employee die before the additional benefits provided for in subdivision (2) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection are paid, the additional benefits are payable to the employee's spouse or children, natural or adopted, legitimate or illegitimate, in addition to benefits provided under section 287.240. If there is no surviving spouse or children and the employee has received less than the additional benefits provided for in subdivision (2) and paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection the remainder of such additional benefits shall be paid as a single payment to the estate of the employee;\n\n(6) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to affect the employee's ability to obtain medical treatment at the employer's expense or any other benefits otherwise available under this chapter.\n\n5. Any employee who obtains benefits under subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section for acquiring asbestosis who later obtains an award for mesothelioma shall not receive more benefits than such employee would receive having only obtained benefits for mesothelioma under this section.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3706, A.L. 1947 V.

Physical examination of employee — exchange of medical records — admissibility of physician's, coroner's records — autopsy may be ordered. —1. After an employee has received an injury he shall from time to time thereafter during disability submit to reasonable medical examination at the request of the employer, the employer's insurer, the commission, the division, an administrative law judge, or the attorney general on behalf of the second injury fund if the employer has not obtained a medical examination report, the time and place of which shall be fixed with due regard to the convenience of the employee and his physical condition and ability to attend. The employee may have his own physician present, and if the employee refuses to submit to the examination, or in any way obstructs it, his right to compensation shall be forfeited during such period unless in the opinion of the commission the circumstances justify the refusal or obstruction.\n\n2. The commission, the division or administrative law judge shall, when deemed necessary, appoint a duly qualified impartial physician to examine the injured employee, and any physician so chosen, if he accepts the appointment, shall promptly make the examination requested and make a complete medical report to the commission or the division in such duplication as to provide all parties with copies thereof. The physician's fee shall be fair and reasonable, as provided in subsection 3 of section 287.140, and the fee and other reasonable costs of the impartial examination may be paid as other costs under this chapter. If all the parties shall have had reasonable access thereto, the report of the physician shall be admissible in evidence.\n\n3. The testimony of any physician who treated or examined the injured employee shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for compensation under this chapter, but only if the medical report of the physician has been made available to all parties as in this section provided. Immediately upon receipt of notice from the division or the commission setting a date for hearing of a case in which the nature and extent of an employee's disability is to be determined, the parties or their attorneys shall arrange, without charge or costs, each to the other, for an exchange of all medical reports, including those made both by treating and examining physician or physicians, to the end that the parties may be commonly informed of all medical findings and opinions. The exchange of medical reports shall be made at least seven days before the date set for the hearing and failure of any party to comply may be grounds for asking for and receiving a continuance, upon proper showing by the party to whom the medical reports were not furnished. If any party fails or refuses to furnish the opposing party with the medical report of the treating or examining physician at least seven days before such physician's deposition or personal testimony at the hearing, as in this section provided, upon the objection of the party who was not provided with the medical report, the physician shall not be permitted to testify at that hearing or by medical deposition.\n\n4. Upon request, an administrative law judge, the division, or the commission shall be provided with a copy of any medical report.\n\n5. As used in this chapter the terms\"physician's report\"and\"medical report\"mean the report of any physician made on any printed form authorized by the division or the commission or any complete medical report. As used in this chapter the term\"complete medical report\"means the report of a physician giving the physician's qualifications and the patient's history, complaints, details of the findings of any and all laboratory, X-ray and all other technical examinations, diagnosis, prognosis, nature of disability, if any, and an estimate of the percentage of permanent partial disability, if any. An element or elements of a complete medical report may be met by the physician's records.\n\n6. Upon the request of a party, the physician or physicians who treated or are treating the injured employee shall be required to furnish to the parties a rating and complete medical report on the injured employee, at the expense of the party selecting the physician, along with a complete copy of the physician's clinical record including copies of any records and reports received from other health care providers.\n\n7. The testimony of a treating or examining physician may be submitted in evidence on the issues in controversy by a complete medical report and shall be admissible without other foundational evidence subject to compliance with the following procedures. The party intending to submit a complete medical report in evidence shall give notice at least sixty days prior to the hearing to all parties and shall provide reasonable opportunity to all parties to obtain cross-examination testimony of the physician by deposition. The notice shall include a copy of the report and all the clinical and treatment records of the physician including copies of all records and reports received by the physician from other health care providers. The party offering the report must make the physician available for cross-examination testimony by deposition not later than seven days before the matter is set for hearing, and each cross-examiner shall compensate the physician for the portion of testimony obtained in an amount not to exceed a rate of reasonable compensation taking into consideration the specialty practiced by the physician. Cross-examination testimony shall not bind the cross-examining party. Any testimony obtained by the offering party shall be at that party's expense on a proportional basis, including the deposition fee of the physician. Upon request of any party, the party offering a complete medical report in evidence must also make available copies of X rays or other diagnostic studies obtained by or relied upon by the physician. Within ten days after receipt of such notice a party shall dispute whether a report meets the requirements of a complete medical report by providing written objections to the offering party stating the grounds for the dispute, and at the request of any party, the administrative law judge shall rule upon such objections upon pretrial hearing whether the report meets the requirements of a complete medical report and upon the admissibility of the report or portions thereof. If no objections are filed the report is admissible, and any objections thereto are deemed waived. Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from agreeing to admit medical reports or records by consent.\n\n8. Certified copies of the proceedings before any coroner holding an inquest over the body of any employee receiving an injury in the course of his employment resulting in death shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for compensation under this chapter, and it shall be the duty of the coroner to give notice of the inquest to the employer and the dependents of the deceased employee, who shall have the right to cross-examine the witness.\n\n9.

There is hereby created in the state treasury a special fund to be known as the \"Second Injury Fund\" created exclusively for the purposes as in this section provided and for special weekly benefits in rehabilitation cases as provided in section 287.141. Maintenance of the second injury fund shall be as provided by section 287.710. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the second injury fund which shall be deposited the same as are state funds and any interest accruing thereon shall be added thereto. The fund shall be subject to audit the same as state funds and accounts and shall be protected by the general bond given by the state treasurer.

All cases of permanent disability where there has been previous disability due to injuries occurring prior to January 1, 2014, shall be compensated as provided in this subsection. Compensation shall be computed on the basis of the average earnings at the time of the last injury. If any employee who has a preexisting permanent partial disability whether from compensable injury or otherwise, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee becomes unemployed, and the preexisting permanent partial disability, if a body as a whole injury, equals a minimum of fifty weeks of compensation or, if a major extremity injury only, equals a minimum of fifteen percent permanent partial disability, according to the medical standards that are used in determining such compensation, receives a subsequent compensable injury resulting in additional permanent partial disability so that the degree or percentage of disability, in an amount equal to a minimum of fifty weeks compensation, if a body as a whole injury or, if a major extremity injury only, equals a minimum of fifteen percent permanent partial disability, caused by the combined disabilities is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the last injury, considered alone and of itself, and if the employee is entitled to receive compensation on the basis of the combined disabilities, the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the degree or percentage of disability which would have resulted from the last injury had there been no preexisting disability. After the compensation liability of the employer for the last injury, considered alone, has been determined by an administrative law judge or the commission, the degree or percentage of employee's disability that is attributable to all injuries or conditions existing at the time the last injury was sustained shall then be determined by that administrative law judge or by the commission and the degree or percentage of disability which existed prior to the last injury plus the disability resulting from the last injury, if any, considered alone, shall be deducted from the combined disability, and compensation for the balance, if any, shall be paid out of a special fund known as the second injury fund, hereinafter provided for. If the previous disability or disabilities, whether from compensable injury or otherwise, and the last injury together result in total and permanent disability, the minimum standards under this subsection for a body as a whole injury or a major extremity injury shall not apply and the employer at the time of the last injury shall be liable only for the disability resulting from the last injury considered alone and of itself; except that if the compensation for which the employer at the time of the last injury is liable is less than the compensation provided in this chapter for permanent total disability, then in addition to the compensation for which the employer is liable and after the completion of payment of the compensation by the employer, the employee shall be paid the remainder of the compensation that would be due for permanent total disability under section 287.200 out of the second injury fund.\n\n3. (1) All claims against the second injury fund for injuries occurring after January 1, 2014, and all claims against the second injury fund involving a subsequent compensable injury which is an occupational disease filed after January 1, 2014, shall be compensated as provided in this subsection.\n\n(2) No claims for permanent partial disability occurring after January 1, 2014, shall be filed against the second injury fund. Claims for permanent total disability under section 287.200 against the second injury fund shall be compensable only when the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) a. An employee has a medically documented preexisting disability equaling a minimum of fifty weeks of permanent partial disability compensation according to the medical standards that are used in determining such compensation which is:\n\n(i) A direct result of active military duty in any branch of the United States Armed Forces; or\n\n(ii) A direct result of a compensable injury as defined in section 287.020; or\n\n(iii) Not a compensable injury, but such preexisting disability directly and significantly aggravates or accelerates the subsequent work-related injury and shall not include unrelated preexisting injuries or conditions that do not aggravate or accelerate the subsequent work-related injury; or\n\n(iv) A preexisting permanent partial disability of an extremity, loss of eyesight in one eye, or loss of hearing in one ear, when there is a subsequent compensable work-related injury as set forth in subparagraph b of the opposite extremity, loss of eyesight in the other eye, or loss of hearing in the other ear; and\n\nb. Such employee thereafter sustains a subsequent compensable work-related injury that, when combined with the preexisting disability, as set forth in items (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph a. of this paragraph, results in a permanent total disability as defined under this chapter; or\n\n(b) An employee is employed in a sheltered workshop as established in sections 205.968 to 205.972 or sections 178.900 to 178.960 and such employee thereafter sustains a compensable work-related injury that, when combined with the preexisting disability, results in a permanent total disability as defined under this chapter.\n\n(3) When an employee is entitled to compensation as provided in this subsection, the employer at the time of the last work-related injury shall only be liable for the disability resulting from the subsequent work-related injury considered alone and of itself.\n\n(4) Compensation for benefits payable under this subsection shall be based on the employee's compensation rate calculated under section 287.250.\n\n4. (1) In all cases in which a recovery against the second injury fund is sought for permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, or death, the state treasurer as custodian thereof shall be named as a party, and shall be entitled to defend against the claim.\n\n(2) The state treasurer, with the advice and consent of the attorney general of Missouri, may enter into compromise settlements as contemplated by section 287.390, or agreed statements of fact that would affect the second injury fund. All awards for permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, or death affecting the second injury fund shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter governing review and appeal.\n\n(3) For all claims filed against the second injury fund on or after July 1, 1994, the attorney general shall use assistant attorneys general except in circumstances where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, to provide legal services as may be required in all claims made for recovery against the fund. Any legal expenses incurred by the attorney general's office in the handling of such claims, including, but not limited to, medical examination fees incurred under sections 287.210 and the expenses provided for under section 287.140, expert witness fees, court reporter expenses, travel costs, and related legal expenses shall be paid by the fund. Effective July 1, 1993, the payment of such legal expenses shall be contingent upon annual appropriations made by the general assembly, from the fund, to the attorney general's office for this specific purpose.\n\n5. If more than one injury in the same employment causes concurrent temporary disabilities, compensation shall be payable only for the longest and largest paying disability.\n\n6. If more than one injury in the same employment causes concurrent and consecutive permanent partial disability, compensation payments for each subsequent disability shall not begin until the end of the compensation period of the prior disability.\n\n7. If an employer fails to insure or self-insure as required in section 287.280, funds from the second injury fund may be withdrawn to cover the fair, reasonable, and necessary expenses incurred relating to claims for injuries occurring prior to January 1, 2014, to cure and relieve the effects of the injury or disability of an injured employee in the employ of an uninsured employer consistent with subsection 3 of section 287.140, or in the case of death of an employee in the employ of an uninsured employer, funds from the second injury fund may be withdrawn to cover fair, reasonable, and necessary expenses incurred relating to a death occurring prior to January 1, 2014, in the manner required in sections 287.240 and 287.241. In defense of claims arising under this subsection, the treasurer of the state of Missouri, as custodian of the second injury fund, shall have the same defenses to such claims as would the uninsured employer. Any funds received by the employee or the employee's dependents, through civil or other action, must go towards reimbursement of the second injury fund, for all payments made to the employee, the employee's dependents, or paid on the employee's behalf, from the second injury fund pursuant to this subsection. The office of the attorney general of the state of Missouri shall bring suit in the circuit court of the county in which the accident occurred against any employer not covered by this chapter as required in section 287.280.\n\n8. Every year the second injury fund shall have an actuarial study made to determine the solvency of the fund taking into consideration any existing balance carried forward from a previous year, appropriate funding level of the fund, and forecasted expenditures from the fund. The first actuarial study shall be completed prior to July 1, 2014. The expenses of such actuarial studies shall be paid out of the fund for the support of the division of workers' compensation.\n\n9. The director of the division of workers' compensation shall maintain the financial data and records concerning the fund for the support of the division of workers' compensation and the second injury fund. The division shall also compile and report data on claims made pursuant to subsection 11 of this section. The attorney general shall provide all necessary information to the division for this purpose.\n\n10. All claims for fees and expenses filed against the second injury fund and all records pertaining thereto shall be open to the public.\n\n11. Any employee who at the time a compensable work-related injury is sustained prior to January 1, 2014, is employed by more than one employer, the employer for whom the employee was working when the injury was sustained shall be responsible for wage loss benefits applicable only to the earnings in that employer's employment and the injured employee shall be entitled to file a claim against the second injury fund for any additional wage loss benefits attributed to loss of earnings from the employment or employments where the injury did not occur, up to the maximum weekly benefit less those benefits paid by the employer in whose employment the employee sustained the injury. The employee shall be entitled to a total benefit based on the total average weekly wage of such employee computed according to subsection 8 of section 287.250. The employee shall not be entitled to a greater rate of compensation than allowed by law on the date of the injury. The employer for whom the employee was working where the injury was sustained shall be responsible for all medical costs incurred in regard to that injury.\n\n12. No compensation shall be payable from the second injury fund if the employee files a claim for compensation under the workers' compensation law of another state with jurisdiction over the employee's injury or accident or occupational disease.\n\n13. Notwithstanding the requirements of section 287.470, the life payments to an injured employee made from the fund shall be suspended when the employee is able to obtain suitable gainful employment or be self-employed in view of the nature and severity of the injury. The division shall promulgate rules setting forth a reasonable standard means test to determine if such employment warrants the suspension of benefits.\n\n14. All awards issued under this chapter affecting the second injury fund shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter governing review and appeal.\n\n15. The division shall pay any liabilities of the fund in the following priority:\n\n(1) Expenses related to the legal defense of the fund under subsection 4 of this section;\n\n(2) Permanent total disability awards in the order in which claims are settled or finally adjudicated;\n\n(3) Permanent partial disability awards in the order in which such claims are settled or finally adjudicated;\n\n(4) Medical expenses incurred prior to July 1, 2012, under subsection 7 of this section; and\n\n(5) Interest on unpaid awards.\n\n­­Such liabilities shall be paid to the extent the fund has a positive balance. Any unpaid amounts shall remain an ongoing liability of the fund until satisfied.\n\n16. Post-award interest for the purpose of second injury fund claims shall be set at the adjusted rate of interest established by the director of revenue pursuant to section 32.065 or five percent, whichever is greater.\n\n17. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 15 of this section to the contrary, the division may pay from the second injury fund any of the following second injury fund liabilities prior to those liabilities listed under subsection 15 of this section:\n\n(1) All death benefits incurred under subsection 7 of this section relating to claims for deaths occurring prior to January 1, 2014, consistent with a temporary or final award; and\n\n(2) Ongoing medical expenses, but not past medical expenses, under subsection 7 of this section relating to claims for injuries occurring prior to January 1, 2014, consistent with a temporary or final award that includes future medical benefits.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3707, A.L. 1943 p. 1068, A.L. 1945 p. 1996, A.L. 1951 p. 617, A.L. 1953 p. 524, A.L. 1955 p. 590, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396, A.L. 1981 H.B. 324, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1605, A.L. 1987 H.B. 564, A.L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1237, et al., A.L. 2013 S.B. 1, A.L. 2021 S.B. 303)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3317\n\n(1956) Section 287.220 is limited to the extent that it enhances or adds to an existing disability.

Cambell \"66\" Express (A.), 297 S.W.2d 22.\n\n(1972) Preexisting disability as required by this section relates to disability to work and means industrial disability or loss of earning capacity rather than physical impairment as such. It must be such as to partially disable the claimant from work or to impede his labors. Jockel v. Robinson (Mo.), 484 S.W.2d 227.\n\n(1997) Claimant could not recover from the Second Injury Fund for wage loss benefits for a second job prior to the effective date of the statute which created the fund.

Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund created — definitions — issuance of payments, when — board of trustees, appointment, meetings, duties. —1. There is hereby created the \"Missouri Mesothelioma Risk Management Fund\", which shall be a body corporate and politic. The board of trustees of this fund shall have the powers and duties specified in this section and such other powers as may be necessary or proper to enable it, its officers, employees and agents to carry out fully and effectively all the purposes of this section.\n\n2. Unless otherwise clearly indicated by the context, the following words and terms as used in this section mean:\n\n(1)\"Board\", the board of trustees of the Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund;\n\n(2)\"Fund\", the Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund established by subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. Any employer may participate in the Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund and use funds collected under this section to pay mesothelioma awards made against an employer member of the fund.\n\n4. Employers who participate in the fund shall make annual contributions to the fund in the amount determined by the board in accordance with this section relating to rates established by insurers. Participation in the fund has the same effect as purchase of insurance by such employer, as otherwise provided by law, and shall have the same effect as a self-insurance plan. Moneys in the fund shall be available for:\n\n(1) The payment and settlement of all claims for which coverage has been obtained by any employer participating in the fund in accordance with coverages offered by the board relating to mesothelioma awards pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of subsection 4 of section 287.200;\n\n(2) Attorney's fees and expenses incurred in the administration and representation of the fund.\n\n5. No amount in excess of the amount specified by paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of subsection 4 of section 287.200 shall be paid from the fund for the payment of claims arising out of any award.\n\n6. The board of trustees of the fund shall issue payment of benefits in accordance with coverages offered by the board. For any year in which any employer does not make a yearly contribution to the fund, the board of trustees of the fund shall not be responsible, in any way, for payment of any claim arising from an occurrence in that year. Any employer which discontinues its participation in the fund may not resume participation in the fund for five calendar years after discontinuing participation. Should an employer fail to make a yearly contribution, such employer shall be liable pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (3) of subsection 4 of section 287.200 if a claim is made in such year. If ongoing benefits are due by the fund for an employer who fails*to make a yearly contribution, such employer shall be liable to the fund for the ongoing benefits.\n\n7. All staff for the fund shall be provided by the department of labor except as otherwise specifically determined by the board. The fund shall reimburse the department of labor for all costs of providing staff required by this subsection. Such reimbursement shall be made on an annual basis, pursuant to contract negotiated between the fund and the department of labor. The fund is a body corporate and politic, and the state of Missouri shall not be liable in any way with respect to claims made against the fund or against member employers covered by the fund, nor with respect to any expense of operation of the fund. Money in the fund is not state money nor is it money collected or received by the state.\n\n8. Each participating employer shall notify the board of trustees of the fund within seven working days of the time notice is received that a claim for benefits has been made against the employer. The employer shall supply information to the board of trustees of the fund concerning any claim upon request. It shall also notify the board of trustees of the fund upon the closing of any claim.\n\n9. The board may contract with independent insurance agents, authorizing such agents to accept contributions to the fund from employers on behalf of the board upon such terms and conditions as the board deems necessary, and may provide a reasonable method of compensating such agents. Such compensation shall not be additional to the contribution to the fund.\n\n10. There is hereby established a \"Board of Trustees of the Missouri Mesothelioma Risk Management Fund\", which shall consist of the director of the department of labor, and four members, appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate, who are officers or employees of those employers participating in the fund. No more than two members appointed by the governor shall be of the same political party. The members appointed by the governor shall serve four-year terms, except that the original appointees shall be appointed for the following terms: one for one year, one for two years, one for three years, and one for four years. Any vacancies occurring on the board shall be filled in the same manner. In appointing the initial board of trustees the governor may anticipate which public entities will participate in the fund, and the appointees may serve the terms designated herein, unless they sooner resign or are removed in accordance with law.\n\n11. No trustee shall be liable personally in any way with respect to claims made against the fund or against member employers covered by the fund.\n\n12. The board shall elect one of their members as chairman. He or she shall preside over meetings of the board and perform such other duties as shall be required by action of the board.\n\n13. The chairman shall appoint another board member as vice chairman, and the vice chairman shall perform the duties of the chairman in the absence of the latter or upon his inability or refusal to act.\n\n14. The board shall appoint a secretary who shall have charge of the offices and records of the fund, subject to the direction of the board.\n\n15. The board shall meet in Jefferson City, Missouri, upon the written call of the chairman or by the agreement of any three members of the board. Notice of the meeting shall be delivered to all other trustees in person or by depositing notice in a United States post office in a properly stamped and addressed envelope not less than six days prior to the date fixed for the meeting. The board may meet at any time by unanimous mutual consent.\n\n16. Three trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and any official action of the board shall be based on a majority vote of the trustees present.\n\n17. The trustees shall serve without compensation but shall receive from the fund their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties for the board.\n\n18. Duties performed for the fund by any member of the board who is an employee of a member employer shall be considered duties in connection with the regular employment of such employer, and such person shall suffer no loss in regular compensation by reason of the performance of such duties.\n\n19. The board shall keep a complete record of all its proceedings.\n\n20. A statement covering the operations of the fund for the year, including income and disbursements, and of the financial condition of the fund at the end of the year, showing the valuation and appraisal of its assets and liabilities, as of July first, shall each year be delivered to the governor and be made readily available to public entities.\n\n21. The general administration of, and responsibility for, the proper operation of the fund, including all decisions relating to payments from the fund, are hereby vested in the board of trustees.\n\n22. The board shall determine and prescribe all rules, regulations, coverages to be offered, forms and rates to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n23. The board shall have exclusive jurisdiction and control over the funds and property of the fund.\n\n24. No trustee or staff member of the fund shall receive any gain or profit from any moneys or transactions of the fund.\n\n25. Any trustee or staff member accepting any gratuity or compensation for the purpose of influencing his or her action with respect to the investment of the funds of the system or in the operations of the fund shall forfeit his or her office.\n\n26. The board shall have the authority to use moneys from the fund to purchase one or more policies of insurance or reinsurance to cover the liabilities of participating employers members which are covered by the fund. If such insurance can be procured, the board shall have the authority to procure insurance covering participating member employers per occurrence for liabilities covered by the fund. The costs of such insurance shall be considered in determining the contribution of each employer member.\n\n27. The board shall have the authority to use moneys from the fund to assist participating members in assessing and reducing the risk of liabilities which may be covered by the fund.\n\n28. The board shall set up and maintain a Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund account in which shall be placed all contributions, premiums, and income from all sources. All property, money, funds, investments, and rights which shall belong to, or be available for expenditure or use by, the fund shall be dedicated to and held in trust for the purposes set out in this section and no other. The board shall have power, in the name of and on behalf of the fund, to purchase, acquire, hold, invest, lend, lease, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of all property, rights, and securities, and enter into written contracts, all as may be necessary or proper to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n29. All moneys received by or belonging to the fund shall be paid to the secretary and deposited by him or her to the credit of the fund in one or more banks or trust companies. No such money shall be deposited in or be retained by any bank and trust company which does not have on deposit with the board at the time the kind and value of collateral required by section 30.270 for depositories of the state treasurer. The secretary shall be responsible for all funds, securities, and property belonging to the fund, and shall give such corporate surety bond for the faithful handling of the same as the board shall require.\n\n30. So far as practicable, the funds and property of the fund shall be kept safely invested so as to earn a reasonable return. The board may invest the funds of the fund as permitted by the laws of Missouri relating to the investment of the capital, reserve, and surplus funds of casualty insurance companies organized under the laws of Missouri.\n\n31. If contributions to the fund do not produce sufficient funds to pay any claims which may be due, the board shall assess and each member, including any member who has withdrawn but was a member in the year in which the assessment is required, shall pay such additional amounts which are each member's proportionate share of total claims allowed and due. The provisions of this subsection shall apply retroactively to the creation of the Missouri mesothelioma risk management fund.\n\n32. The board, in order to carry out the purposes for which the fund is established, may select and employ, or contract with, persons experienced in insurance underwriting, accounting, the servicing of claims, and ratemaking, who shall serve at the board's pleasure, as technical advisors in establishing the annual contribution, or may call upon the director of the department of commerce and insurance for such services.\n\n33. Nothing in this section shall be construed to broaden or restrict the liability of the member employers participating in the fund beyond the provisions of this section**, nor to abolish or waive any defense at law which might otherwise be available to any employer member.\n\n34. If, at the end of any fiscal year, the fund has a balance exceeding projected needs, and adequate reserves, the board may in its discretion refund on a pro rata basis to all participating employer members an amount based on the contributions of the public entity for the immediately preceding year.\n\n(L. 2013 S.B. 1)\n\nEffective 1-01-14\n\n*Word \"fail\" appears in original rolls.\n\n**Word \"sections\" appears in original rolls.",

Death benefits and burial expenses, amount, to whom paid and when paid — dependent defined — death benefits, how distributed — record of dependents, employer to keep — dependents to report to division, procedure. —If the injury causes death, either with or without disability, the compensation therefor shall be as provided in this section:\n\n(1) In all cases the employer shall pay direct to the persons furnishing the same the reasonable expense of the burial of the deceased employee not exceeding five thousand dollars. But no person shall be entitled to compensation for the burial expenses of a deceased employee unless he or she has furnished the same by authority of the widow or widower, the nearest relative of the deceased employee in the county of his or her death, his or her personal representative, or the employer, who shall have the right to give the authority in the order named. All fees and charges under this section shall be fair and reasonable, shall be subject to regulation by the division or the commission and shall be limited to such as are fair and reasonable for similar service to persons of a like standard of living. The division or the commission shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine all disputes as to the charges. If the deceased employee leaves no dependents, the death benefit in this subdivision provided shall be the limit of the liability of the employer under this chapter on account of the death, except as herein provided for burial expenses and except as provided in section 287.140; provided that in all cases when the employer admits or does not deny liability for the burial expense, it shall be paid within thirty days after written notice, that the service has been rendered, has been delivered to the employer. The notice may be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, or may be made by personal delivery;\n\n(2) The employer shall also pay to the dependents of the employee a death benefit based on the employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury that results in the death of the employee, as provided in section 287.250. The amount of compensation for death, which shall be paid in installments in the same manner that compensation is required to be paid under this chapter, shall be computed as follows:\n\n(a) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September 28, 1983, but before September 28, 1986, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July first immediately preceding the date of injury;\n\n(b) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September 28, 1986, but before August 28, 1990, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy-five percent of the state average weekly wage, as such wage is determined by the division of employment security, as of the July first immediately preceding the date of injury;\n\n(c) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after August 28, 1990, but before August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred percent of the state average weekly wage;\n\n(d) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after August 28, 1991, the weekly compensation shall be an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the injured employee's average weekly earnings as of the date of the injury; provided that the weekly compensation paid under this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to one hundred five percent of the state average weekly wage;\n\n(e) If the injury which caused the death occurred on or after September 28, 1981, the weekly compensation shall in no event be less than forty dollars per week;\n\n(3) The word\"dependent\"as used in this chapter shall mean:\n\n(a) A wife upon a husband with whom she lives or who is legally liable for her support, and a husband upon a wife with whom he lives or who is legally liable for his support; provided that on the death or remarriage of a widow or widower, the death benefit shall cease unless there be other dependents entitled to any death benefits under this chapter. In the event of remarriage, a lump sum payment equal in amount to the benefits due for a period of two years shall be paid to the widow or widower. Thereupon the periodic death benefits shall cease unless there are other dependents entitled to any death benefit under this chapter, in which event the periodic benefits to which such widow or widower would have been entitled had he or she not died or remarried shall be divided among such other dependents and paid to them during their period of entitlement under this chapter; or\n\n(b) A natural, posthumous, or adopted child or children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, including any stepchild claimable by the deceased on his or her federal tax return at the time of injury, under the age of eighteen years, or over that age if physically or mentally incapacitated from wage earning, upon the parent legally liable for the support or with whom he, she, or they are living at the time of the death of the parent. In case there is a wife or a husband mentally or physically incapacitated from wage earning, dependent upon a wife or husband, and a child or more than one child thus dependent, the death benefit shall be divided among them in such proportion as may be determined by the commission after considering their ages and other facts bearing on the dependency. In all other cases questions of the degree of dependency shall be determined in accordance with the facts at the time of the injury, and in such other cases if there is more than one person wholly dependent the death benefit shall be divided equally among them. The payment of death benefits to a child or other dependent as provided in this paragraph shall cease when the dependent dies, attains the age of eighteen years, or becomes physically and mentally capable of wage earning over that age, or until twenty-two years of age if the child of the deceased is in attendance and remains as a full-time student in any accredited educational institution, or if at eighteen years of age the dependent child is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty; provided, however, that such dependent child shall be entitled to compensation during four years of full-time attendance at a fully accredited educational institution to commence prior to twenty-three years of age and immediately upon cessation of his or her active duty in the Armed Forces, unless there are other dependents entitled to the death benefit under this chapter;\n\n(4) The division or the commission may, in its discretion, order or award the share of compensation of any such child to be paid to the parent, grandparent, or other adult next of kin or conservator of the child for the latter's support, maintenance and education, which order or award upon notice to the parties may be modified from time to time by the commission in its discretion with respect to the person to whom shall be paid the amount of the order or award remaining unpaid at the time of the modification;\n\n(5) The payments of compensation by the employer in accordance with the order or award of the division or the commission shall discharge the employer from all further obligations as to the compensation;\n\n(6) All death benefits in this chapter shall be paid in installments in the same manner as provided for disability compensation;\n\n(7) Every employer shall keep a record of the correct names and addresses of the dependents of each of his or her employees, and upon the death of an employee by accident arising out of and in the course of his or her employment shall so far as possible immediately furnish the division with such names and addresses;\n\n(8) Dependents receiving death benefits under the provisions of this chapter shall annually report to the division as to marital status in the case of a widow or widower or age and physical or mental condition of a dependent child.

Compensation, computation of — average weekly wage, division or commission may determine, when — additional compensation for persons under twenty-one, when — multiple employers, computation of coverage — weekly wage — compromise settlement. —1. Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, the method of computing an injured employee's average weekly earnings which will serve as the basis for compensation provided for in this chapter shall be as follows:\n\n(1) If the wages are fixed by the week, the amount so fixed shall be the average weekly wage;\n\n(2) If the wages are fixed by the month, the average weekly wage shall be the monthly wage so fixed multiplied by twelve and divided by fifty-two;\n\n(3) If the wages are fixed by the year, the average weekly wage shall be the yearly wage fixed divided by fifty-two;\n\n(4) If the wages were fixed by the day, hour, or by the output of the employee, the average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing by thirteen the wages earned while actually employed by the employer in each of the last thirteen calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the employee was injured or if actually employed by the employer for less than thirteen weeks, by the number of calendar weeks, or any portion of a week, during which the employee was actually employed by the employer. For purposes of computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this subdivision, absence of five regular or scheduled work days, even if not in the same calendar week, shall be considered as absence for a calendar week. If the employee commenced employment on a day other than the beginning of a calendar week, such calendar week and the wages earned during such week shall be excluded in computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this subdivision;\n\n(5) If the employee has been employed less than two calendar weeks immediately preceding the injury, the employee's weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment at the time of the injury, except if the employer has agreed to a certain hourly wage, then the hourly wage agreed upon multiplied by the number of weekly hours scheduled shall be the employee's average weekly wage;\n\n(6) If the hourly wage has not been fixed or cannot be ascertained, or the employee earned no wage, the wage for the purpose of calculating compensation shall be taken to be the usual wage for similar services where such services are rendered by paid employees of the employer or any other employer;\n\n(7) In computing the average weekly wage pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (6) of this subsection, an employee shall be considered to have been actually employed for only those weeks in which labor is actually performed by the employee for the employer and wages are actually paid by the employer as compensation for such labor.\n\n2. For purposes of this section, the term\"gross wages\"includes, in addition to money payments for services rendered, the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging or similar advance received from the employer, except if such benefits continue to be provided during the period of the disability, then the value of such benefits shall not be considered in calculating the average weekly wage of the employee. The term\"wages\", as used in this section, includes the value of any gratuities received in the course of employment from persons other than the employer to the extent that such gratuities are reported for income tax purposes. \"Wages\", as used in this section, does not include fringe benefits such as retirement, pension, health and welfare, life insurance, training, Social Security or other employee or dependent benefit plan furnished by the employer for the benefit of the employee. Any wages paid to helpers or any money paid by the employer to the employee to cover any special expenses incurred by the employee because of the nature of his employment shall not be included in wages.\n\n3. If an employee is hired by the employer for less than the number of hours per week needed to be classified as a full-time or regular employee, benefits computed for purposes of this chapter for permanent partial disability, permanent total disability and death benefits shall be based upon the average weekly wage of a full-time or regular employee engaged by the employer to perform work of the same or similar nature and at the number of hours per week required by the employer to classify the employee as a full-time or regular employee, but such computation shall not be based on less than thirty hours per week.\n\n4. If pursuant to this section the average weekly wage cannot fairly and justly be determined by the formulas provided in subsections 1 to 3 of this section, the division or the commission may determine the average weekly wage in such manner and by such method as, in the opinion of the division or the commission, based upon the exceptional facts presented, fairly determine such employee's average weekly wage.\n\n5. In computing the compensation to be paid to an employee, who, before the injury for which the employee claims compensation, was disabled and drawing compensation under the provisions of this chapter, the compensation for each subsequent injury shall be apportioned according to the proportion of incapacity and disability caused by the respective injuries which the employee may have suffered.\n\n6. For purposes of establishing a rate of compensation applicable only to permanent partial disability, permanent total disability and death benefits, pursuant to this chapter, the average weekly wage for an employee who is under the age of twenty-one years shall be adjusted to take into consideration the increased earning power of such employee until she or he attains the age of twenty-one years and the average weekly wage for an employee who is an apprentice or a trainee, and whose earnings would reasonably be expected to increase, shall be adjusted to reflect a level of expected increase, based upon completion of apprenticeship or traineeship, provided that such adjustment of the average weekly wage shall not consider expected increase for a period occurring more than three years after the date of the injury.\n\n7. In all cases in which it is found by the division or the commission that the employer knowingly employed a minor in violation of the child labor laws of this state, a fifty percent additional compensation shall be allowed.\n\n8. For an employee with multiple employments, as to the employee's entitlement to any temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits only pursuant to subsection 9*of section 287.220, and for no other purposes, the employee's total average weekly wage shall be equal to the sum of the total of the average weekly wage computed separately for each employment pursuant to the provisions of this section to which the employee is unable to return because of this injury.\n\n9. The parties, by agreement and with approval of an administrative law judge, legal advisor or the commission, may enter into a compromise lump sum settlement in either permanent total or permanent partial disability cases which prorates the lump sum settlement over the life expectancy of the injured worker. When such an agreement has been approved, neither the weekly compensation rate paid throughout the case nor the maximum statutory weekly rate applicable to the injury shall apply. No compensation rate shall exceed the maximum statutory weekly rate as of the date of the injury. Instead, the prorated rate set forth in the approved settlement documents shall control and become the rate for that case. This section shall be retroactive in effect.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3710, A.L. 1965 p. 397, A.L. 1981 H.B. 324, A.L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1237, et al.)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3320\n\n*Due to changes in S.B. 1, 2013, the language referred to appears to currently be contained in subsection 11 of section 287.220.\n\n(1956) Pension paid by a former employer is not \"earnings\" or \"gratuity\" to be considered in computing the employee's annual earnings. Zasslow v. Service Blue Print Co. (A.), 288 S.W.2d 377.\n\n(1958) Where employee had been hired at $1.50 per hour to trim trees over a roof to enable television antenna to be installed and was injured in fall shortly after commencing job, his compensation for total permanent disability was computed by applying the 200 days provision of subdivision (5) to daily wage of $12, since employer's custom was to employ extra help on basis of eight-hour day and the exact number of working days was not otherwise determinable. Noland v. George Tatum Mercantile Co. (Mo.), 313 S.W.2d 633.\n\n(1962) Where the employee was not engaged in the employment of the same employer for the full year preceding the accident, subsection 3 is controlling, and it is immaterial that the deceased was drawing Social Security or may have actually earned less than earnings that would be established on the comparative method of computation. Cross v. Crabtree (A.), 364 S.W.2d 61.\n\n(1963) Where claimant sustained injuries arising out of the course of his employment as volunteer fireman, his compensation was calculated under subdivision (5) since his particular employment was to operate for only a small part of the working days of each year.

Employer's entire liability to be covered, self-insurer or approved carrier — exception — group of employers may qualify as self-insurers, requirements — rules — confidential records. —1. Every employer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall, on either an individual or group basis, insure their entire liability under the workers' compensation law; and may insure in whole or in part their employer liability, under a policy of insurance or a self-insurance plan, except as hereafter provided, with some insurance carrier authorized to insure such liability in this state, except that an employer or group of employers may themselves carry the whole or any part of the liability without insurance upon satisfying the division of their ability to do so. If an employer or group of employers have qualified to self-insure their liability under this chapter, the division of workers' compensation may, if it finds after a hearing that the employer or group of employers are willfully and intentionally violating the provisions of this chapter with intent to defraud their employees of their right to compensation, suspend or revoke the right of the employer or group of employers to self-insure their liability. If the employer or group of employers fail to comply with this section, an injured employee or his or her dependents may elect after the injury either to bring an action against such employer or group of employers to recover damages for personal injury or death and it shall not be a defense that the injury or death was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, or that the employee had assumed the risk of the injury or death, or that the injury or death was caused to any degree by the negligence of the employee; or to recover under this chapter with the compensation payments commuted and immediately payable; or, if the employee elects to do so, he or she may file a request with the division for payment to be made for medical expenses out of the second injury fund as provided in subsection 7 of section 287.220. If the employer or group of employers are carrying their own insurance, on the application of any person entitled to compensation and on proof of default in the payment of any installment, the division shall require the employer or group of employers to furnish security for the payment of the compensation, and if not given, all other compensation shall be commuted and become immediately payable; provided, that employers engaged in the mining business shall be required to insure only their liability hereunder to the extent of the equivalent of the maximum liability under this chapter for ten deaths in any one accident, but the employer or group of employers may carry their own risk for any excess liability. When a group of employers enter into an agreement to pool their liabilities under this chapter, individual members will not be required to qualify as individual self-insurers.\n\n2. Groups of employers qualified to insure their liability pursuant to chapter 537 or this chapter shall utilize a uniform experience rating plan promulgated by an approved advisory organization. Such groups shall develop experience ratings for their members based on the plan. Nothing in this section shall relieve an employer from remitting, without any charge to the employer, the employer's claims history to an approved advisory organization.\n\n3. For every entity qualified to group self-insure their liability pursuant to this chapter or chapter 537, each entity shall not authorize total discounts for any individual member exceeding twenty-five percent beginning January 1, 1999. All discounts shall be based on objective quantitative factors and applied uniformly to all trust members.\n\n4. Any group of employers that have qualified to self-insure their liability pursuant to this chapter shall file with the division premium rates, based on pure premium rate data, adjusted for loss development and loss trending as filed by the advisory organization with the department of commerce and insurance pursuant to section 287.975, plus any estimated expenses and other factors or based on average rate classifications calculated by the department of commerce and insurance as taken from the premium rates filed by the twenty insurance companies providing the greatest volume of workers' compensation insurance coverage in this state. The rate is inadequate if funds equal to the full ultimate cost of anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses are not produced when the prospective loss costs are applied to anticipated payrolls. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to those political subdivisions of this state that have qualified to self-insure their liability pursuant to this chapter as authorized by section 537.620 on an assessment plan. Any such group may file with the division a composite rate for all coverages provided under that section.\n\n5. When considering applications for new trust self-insurers, as described under 8 CSR 50-3.010, the division shall require proof of payment by each member of not less than twenty-five percent of the estimated annual premium; except that, for new members who wish to join an existing trust self-insurer during the policy year rather than at the beginning of the policy year, the division shall require proof of payment of the lesser of the estimated premium of three months or the estimated premium for the balance of the policy year.\n\n6. Self-insured trusts, as described under 8 CSR 50-3.010, may invest surplus moneys from a prior trust year not needed for current obligations. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, upon approval by the division, a self-insured trust may invest up to one hundred percent of surplus moneys in securities designated by the state treasurer as acceptable collateral to secure state deposits under section 30.270.\n\n7. Any finding or determination made by the division under this section may be reviewed as provided in sections 287.470 and 287.480.\n\n8. If a group of employers who have been granted self-insurance authority under this chapter or chapter 537 or a public sector individual employer granted self-insurance authority under this chapter is deemed insolvent, determined to be insolvent, or files for bankruptcy, and fails to pay any of its obligations that are owed to an injured employee or an injured employee's dependent or dependents pursuant to this chapter, whether based upon a compromise settlement approved pursuant to section 287.390 or based upon an award issued pursuant to this chapter, the division shall call upon the entire security posted by the group of employers or public sector individual employer. The division may refer all known losses or cases of the group of employers or public sector individual employer to a third-party administrator or any such entity authorized in this state to administer the workers' compensation cases. The third-party administrator or entity to which the losses are transferred shall have the authority to receive the security proceeds from the division and use the proceeds, after deducting reasonable administrative expenses, to pay the compensation benefits owed pursuant to this chapter. The security proceeds shall not be considered state property and shall not be subject to appropriation by the general assembly. Any unused portion of the security proceeds shall be returned to the division. The group of employers or public sector individual employer may apply to the division for release of the unused portion of the security proceeds as set forth in rules promulgated by the division. Neither the division nor any third-party administrator shall be obligated or required to pay any obligations or moneys in an amount in excess of the security proceeds, and neither the division nor any third-party administrator shall be liable for any interest or penalties. The joint and several liability of the members of a group that is deemed insolvent, that is determined to be insolvent, or that files for bankruptcy shall continue and shall not be terminated by payment of benefits under this subsection.\n\n9. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of this section shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of section 536.024.\n\n10. Any records submitted pursuant to this section, and pursuant to any rule promulgated by the division pursuant to this section, shall be considered confidential and not subject to chapter 610.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of section 287.280, every employer who obtains part of his work force from another entity through an employee leasing arrangement, or who employs the services of an entity through an employee leasing arrangement, may be required to cover his liability under the provisions of this chapter, through separate coverages or separate self-insurance on his leased employees and his nonleased employees. The director of the department of commerce and insurance may, by rule, establish the standards and procedures by which insurance coverage shall be provided to employers using only leased employees, and to employers using both leased and nonleased employees. The director of the division of workers' compensation may, by a rule, establish the standards and procedures for qualification for self-insurance for employers using only leased employees and for employers using both leased and nonleased employees.\n\n2. Such rules shall include, but not be limited to, the registration of employee leasing arrangements prior to their eligibility for insurance, or self-insurance, the information reporting requirements for both employee leasing arrangements and for employers who use such arrangements, the extent to which a client employer's experience shall determine the premium or bond or other security amount for coverage on leased employees, and the procedures by which such coverage or self-insurance on leased employees shall be issued, endorsed, audited, cancelled and nonrenewed.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, the term\"employee leasing arrangement\"shall not include temporary help service arrangements which assign their employees to clients for a finite period of time to support or supplement the client's work force in special work situations, such as employee absences, temporary skill shortages and seasonal workloads, and which are not knowingly utilized as a mechanism of depriving one or more insurers of premiums which otherwise are properly payable.\n\n4. When an employee leasing company leases employees to only one client company and its affiliates, there is a rebuttable presumption that the client company entered into an employee leasing arrangement to avoid the calculation of the proper contribution rate for payment of workers' compensation through insurance or self-insurance.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 975 § 2)",

Every policy of insurance against liability under this chapter shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and shall be in a form approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance. Such policy shall contain an agreement that the insurer accepts all of the provisions of this chapter, that the same may be enforced by any person entitled to any rights under this chapter as well as by the employer, that the insurer shall be a party to all agreements or proceedings under this chapter, and his appearance may be entered therein and jurisdiction over his person may be obtained as in this chapter provided, and such covenants shall be enforceable notwithstanding any default of the employer.\n\n2. Any insurer issuing a workers' compensation policy may offer, as a part of the policy or as an optional endorsement to the policy, a deductible plan or plans to allow the insured employer to self-insure for the deductible amount, subject to the approval of the director of the department of commerce and insurance. No deductible plan shall be approved which permits, directly or indirectly, any part of the deductible to be charged to or passed on to an employee of the insured employer.\n\n3. Any deductible plan authorized under this section may provide for the agreement between the insurer and the insured employer regarding the conditions under which the employer shall be responsible for the payment of any deductible amount to the person or health care provider entitled to such payment pursuant to this chapter, except that no deductible plan shall be approved unless the insurer shall retain the ultimate responsibility for the payment of compensable claims. Where the agreement provides for the payment of the deductible amount by the insurer, the insurer shall pay all the deductible amount applicable to a compensable claim directly to the person or health care provider entitled to the benefit pursuant to this chapter, and shall then be reimbursed by the insured employer for such payments. The insured employer shall be liable to the insurer up to the limit of the deductible, and any failure on the part of the insured employer to provide such reimbursements shall be treated under the workers' compensation policy in the same manner as a nonpayment of premium. An employer's failure to reimburse deductible amounts to the insurer shall not cause the unpaid amount to be paid from the second injury fund under section 287.220. The insurer shall have the right to offset unpaid deductible amounts against unearned premiums, if any, in the event of a cancellation of the policy.\n\n4. Deductible plans shall provide appropriate premium reductions, as approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance, to reflect the type and level of the deductible amount selected. Losses paid by the employer under the deductible shall be credited against the employer's experience modification while the deductible option is used, unless the employer exercises the right to purchase a gross reportable deductible plan.\n\n5. An insurer shall not be required to offer a deductible if, as a result of a credit investigation, the insurer determines that the employer does not have the financial ability to be responsible for the payment of deductible amounts.\n\n6. An insurer shall service and, if necessary, defend all claims that arise during the policy period, including those claims payable in whole or in part from the deductible amount.\n\n7. No employer who self-insures for a deductible amount as provided in this section shall harass, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against any employee because the employee has taken any action or is considering taking action which might result in the insured employer being required to pay a deductible amount.\n\n8. Any rating organization or advisory organization authorized by the provisions of section 287.330 may file on behalf of its members deductible plans for approval by the director of the department of commerce and insurance.\n\n9. In calculating the administrative surcharge owed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for workers' compensation policies with deductible options, the administrative surcharge owed will be based upon the total premiums, which would have been paid for the deductible credit portion of the policy. The second injury fund surcharge owed by the employer who purchases a deductible policy will be assessed upon the total premiums which would have been paid in the absence of the deductible option. The premium taxes owed pursuant to this chapter for workers' compensation policies with deductible options shall be assessed upon those total premiums paid upon the insurance policy excluding the deductible credit portion of the policy. The portion of the workers' compensation policy with a deductible option that is subject to an administrative surcharge shall not be subject to premium taxes, nor with respect to foreign insurance companies, the retaliatory tax imposed pursuant to section 375.916.\n\n10.

The board shall consist of five persons who shall be voting members appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. Three members shall be representative of the interests of employers with at least one being representative of employers whose employees are represented by a labor union and at least one being representative of employers whose employees are not represented by a labor union. One member shall be a representative of the interests of insurers, and one member shall be a representative of the interests of independent insurance agents. One member representing employers shall act as chairman of the board elected by the board. Not more than three members of the board shall belong to the same political party.

The state actuary and a representative of a rating organization licensed by the state shall be nonvoting members of the board, and their duties shall include advising the board on matters relating to code classifications, including the creation of new code classifications. The board members shall not receive any compensation, except that such members shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. In addition, the board may employ staff to perform the administrative duties of the board. The department of commerce and insurance may charge a fee against the classification agent as the director deems appropriate.\n\n2. Upon application of any employer, the board shall review the code classification made on that employer. If the board determines that the classification was erroneous, it may change the classification by placing the employer under a different code classification already established or by creating a new classification code, if the board determines that there is sufficient experience to merit a new classification code. The establishment of the rate for a new classification code shall be filed with the director of the department of commerce and insurance by either the affected employer or employers or by any recognized rating organization within ninety days of the establishment of the new classification code by the board. The director of the department of commerce and insurance shall review the filed rate according to section 287.955. Upon application of any employer, the board shall review the calculation of an employer's experience modification factor and may order a recalculation in the experience modification factor if calculated erroneously under the formula as approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance, including an adjustment for any recovery from a third party pursuant to the employer's right of subrogation. An appeal from the determination of an appropriate classification by the board may be made to the director of the department of commerce and insurance. The board may review code classifications of individual self-insured employers and self-insured employers in a group insurance arrangement.\n\n3. The board may also recommend changes to the uniform classification system.\n\n4. The advisory organization that makes a uniform classification system for use in setting rates in this state shall provide to the affected party or his designated agent, at a reasonable charge, information used or considered in determining the development purpose, scope and intended application of any classification comprising such uniform classification system.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251)\n\nEffective 1-01-94",

In instances where the last day for the filing of any such paper falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the filing shall be deemed timely if accomplished on the next day subsequent which is neither a Sunday or a legal holiday. When filing by electronic facsimile meeting the requirements of the division, the parties shall, on the same date as the facsimile transmission, mail by the United States mail the original and the requisite number of copies to the commission. In addition, the commission may allow filing of applications for review, briefs, motions, and other requests for relief with the commission by electronic means, in such manner as the commission may, by regulation, prescribe.\n\n2. An employer who has been determined by the division to be an employer subject to and operating pursuant to this chapter and has also been determined to be uninsured may file an application for review but such application for review shall be accompanied with and attached to the application for review a bond which shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the award in full, and if for any reason the appeal is dismissed or if the award is affirmed or modified, to satisfy in full such modification of the award as the commission may award. The surety on such bond shall be a bank, savings and loan institution or an insurance company licensed to do business in the state of Missouri. No appeal to the commission shall be considered filed unless accompanied by such bond and such bond shall also be a prerequisite for appeal as provided in section 287.495 and such appeal pursuant to section 287.495 shall not be considered filed unless accompanied by such bond. If any other employer pursuant to section 287.040 would be liable, the employee shall be paid benefits from the bond until the bond is exhausted before the section 287.040 employer is required to pay.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3731, A.L. 1963 p. 410, A.L. 1974 S.B. 417, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1237, et al., A.L. 2021 S.B. 303)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3341\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nWorkers' compensation claims to be reviewed only by administrative law judges, commission or appellate courts, 287.801\n\n(1958) Application for review deemed made on date it was received by commission rather than on date it was deposited in mail so that application for review, mailed on April 29 and received by commission on April 30, of an award made on April 19 was not timely made and commission had no jurisdiction to review referee's award.

The final award of the commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either party to the dispute shall within thirty days from the date of the final award appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the accident occurred, or if the accident occurred outside of this state, then in the county where the contract of employment was made. Such appeal may be taken by filing notice of appeal with the commission, whereupon the commission shall under its certificate return to the court all documents and papers on file in the matter, together with a transcript of the evidence, the findings and award, which shall thereupon become the record of the cause. Upon appeal no additional evidence shall be heard and in the absence of fraud, the findings of fact made by the commission within its powers shall be conclusive and binding.

Harger v. Acme Fast Freight Inc. (Mo.), 336 S.W.2d 109.\n\n(1963) Industrial commission was not required to set out specific findings of facts as to each individual injury and the resultant percent of disability attributed to each, and ultimate findings of commission that claimant sustained 40% permanent partial disability to body as a whole was sufficient and award was properly based thereon. Carenza v. Vulcan-Cincinnati, Inc.

City of Independence (Mo.), 370 S.W.2d 310.\n\n(1963) Commission's finding that janitor's activity amounted to \"an unusual or abnormal strain\" which constituted an accident because he exerted himself beyond his usual routine in clearing snow from extensive area of employer's sidewalk was a legal conclusion and, therefore, award was subject to review. Flippin v. First National Bank of Joplin (A.), 372 S.W.2d 273.\n\n(1965) Finding of fact held sufficient to sustain order denying compensation. Dixon v. Art Bunker Motors, Inc. (A.), 387 S.W.2d 199.\n\n(1965) In workmen's compensation case the reviewing court cannot substitute its own judgment on the evidence for that of the industrial commission, but is empowered to determine whether the award of the commission is supported by competent and substantial evidence on the whole record. Jacobs v. Eldridge Construction Co. (A.), 393 S.W.2d 33.\n\n(1967) Decisions of the industrial commission which are clearly the interpretation or application of law, rather than a determination of facts, are not binding upon appeals court. Saxton v. St. Louis Stair Company (A.), 410 S.W.2d 369.\n\n(1967) Where there is no material conflict in, or dispute concerning, the facts bearing upon a claimant's status as an employee vel non, the resolution of that issue becomes a question of law and the industrial commission's determination is not binding on the reviewing court. Lawson v. Lawson (A.), 415 S.W.2d 313.\n\n(1969) Decisions of the industrial commission which are clearly the interpretations or applications of the law, as distinguished from a determination of facts, are not binding upon the court and are within the province of review and correction. Weilert v. Fruin-Colnon Corp. (A.), 447 S.W.2d 781.\n\n(1970) Notice of Appeal to Industrial Commission affirmation of a Workman's Compensation Award must be received within 30 days. Holmes v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc. (A.), 488 S.W.2d 311.\n\n(1971) The findings of a referee are not binding on the commission but a reviewing court must affirm an award by the commission if it is supported by competent and substantial evidence on the whole record thus though the evidence was conflicting and some of claimant's testimony was contradictory, but not to sufficient degree to destroy essential elements of his case, the court affirmed the award.

Immediately after receiving certification from the director of the department of commerce and insurance of the amount of tax due from the various companies or self-insurers, the director of revenue shall notify and assess each company or self-insurer the amount of taxes on its premiums for the calendar year ending on the thirty-first day of December, next preceding. The director of revenue shall also notify and assess each company or self-insurer the amount of the estimated quarterly installments to be made for the calendar year. If the amount of the actual tax due for any year exceeds the total of the installments made for such year, the balance of the tax due shall be paid on the first day of June of the year following, together with the regular quarterly payment due at that time. If the total amount of the tax actually due is less than the total amount of the installments actually paid, the amount by which the amount paid exceeds the amount due shall be credited against the tax for the following year and deducted from the quarterly installment otherwise due on the first day of June. If the March first quarterly installment made by a company or self-insurer is less than the amount assessed by the director of revenue, the difference will be due on June first, but no interest will accrue to the state on the difference unless the amount paid by the company or self-insurer is less than eighty percent of one-fourth of the total amount of tax assessed by the director of revenue for the immediately preceding taxable year.\n\n3. Upon the receipt of the returns and verification by the director of the division of workers' compensation as to the percent of tax to be imposed, the director of the department of commerce and insurance shall certify the amount of tax due from the various insurance carriers or self-insurers on the basis and at the rate provided in section 287.690, and make a schedule thereof, duplicate copies of which, properly certified by the director, shall be filed in the offices of the revenue department, the state treasurer, and the division of workers' compensation on or before the thirtieth day of April of each year. If the taxes provided for in this section are not paid, the department of revenue shall certify the fact to the director of the department of commerce and insurance who shall thereafter suspend the delinquent carriers of insurance or self-insurers from the further transaction of business in this state until the taxes are paid.\n\n4. Upon receipt of the money all such moneys shall be deposited to the credit of the fund for the support of the division of workers' compensation.\n\n5. The tax collected for implementing the workers' compensation fund, and any interest accruing thereon, under the police power of the state from those specified in sections 287.690, 287.715, and 287.730 shall be used for the purpose of making effective the law to relieve victims of industrial injuries from having individually to bear the burden of misfortune or becoming charges upon society and for the further purpose of providing for the physical rehabilitation of the victims of industrial injuries, and for no other purposes. It is hereby made the express duty of every person exercising any official authority or responsibility in and for the state of Missouri sacredly to safeguard and preserve all funds collected, and any interest accruing thereon, under and by virtue of sections 287.690, 287.715, and 287.730 for the purposes hereinabove declared.\n\n6. The funds created by virtue of sections 287.220, 287.690, 287.715, and 287.730 shall be exempt from the provisions of section 33.080, specifically as they relate to the transfer of fund balances and any interest thereon to the ordinary revenue, and the director of the division of workers' compensation may direct the state treasurer to invest all or part of these funds in interest-bearing accounts as provided in Article IV, Section 15 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri, and any unexpended balance in the second injury fund at the end of any appropriation period shall be a credit in the second injury fund and shall be the amount of the fund at the beginning of the appropriation period next immediately following.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 3757, A.L. 1945 p. 1996, A.L. 1953 p. 524, A.L. 1955 p. 590, A.L. 1967 p. 392, A.L. 1971 H.B. 321, A.L. 1977 H.B. 182, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1396, A.L. 1982 S.B. 470, A.L. 1986 S.B. 545, A.L. 1987 H.B. 564, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1244, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 3367",

Annual surcharge required for second injury fund, amount, how computed, collection — violation, penalty — supplemental surcharge, amount, expiration date. —1. For the purpose of providing for revenue for the second injury fund, every authorized self-insurer, and every workers' compensation policyholder insured pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be liable for payment of an annual surcharge in accordance with the provisions of this section. The annual surcharge imposed under this section shall apply to all workers' compensation insurance policies and self-insurance coverages which are written or renewed on or after April 26, 1988, including the state of Missouri, including any of its departments, divisions, agencies, commissions, and boards or any political subdivisions of the state who self-insure or hold themselves out to be any part self-insured. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the surcharge imposed pursuant to this section shall not apply to any reinsurance or retrocessional transaction.\n\n2. Beginning October 31, 2005, and each year thereafter, the director of the division of workers' compensation shall estimate the amount of benefits payable from the second injury fund during the following calendar year and shall calculate the total amount of the annual surcharge to be imposed during the following calendar year upon all workers' compensation policyholders and authorized self-insurers. The amount of the annual surcharge percentage to be imposed upon each policyholder and self-insured for the following calendar year commencing with the calendar year beginning on January 1, 2006, shall be set at and calculated against a percentage, not to exceed three percent, of the policyholder's or self-insured's workers' compensation net deposits, net premiums, or net assessments for the previous policy year, rounded up to the nearest one-half of a percentage point, that shall generate, as nearly as possible, one hundred ten percent of the moneys to be paid from the second injury fund in the following calendar year, less any moneys contained in the fund at the end of the previous calendar year. All policyholders and self-insurers shall be notified by the division of workers' compensation within ten calendar days of the determination of the surcharge percent to be imposed for, and paid in, the following calendar year. The net premium equivalent for individual self-insured employers shall be based on average rate classifications calculated by the department of commerce and insurance as taken from premium rates filed by the twenty insurance companies providing the greatest volume of workers' compensation insurance coverage in this state. For employers qualified to self-insure their liability pursuant to this chapter, the rates filed by such group of employers in accordance with subsection 4 of section 287.280 shall be the net premium equivalent. Any group of political subdivisions of this state qualified to self-insure their liability pursuant to this chapter as authorized by section 537.620 may choose either the average rate classification method or the filed rate method, provided that the method used may only be changed once without receiving the consent of the director of the division of workers' compensation. The director may advance funds from the workers' compensation fund to the second injury fund if surcharge collections prove to be insufficient. Any funds advanced from the workers' compensation fund to the second injury fund must be reimbursed by the second injury fund no later than December thirty-first of the year following the advance. The surcharge shall be collected from policyholders by each insurer at the same time and in the same manner that the premium is collected, but no insurer or its agent shall be entitled to any portion of the surcharge as a fee or commission for its collection. The surcharge is not subject to any taxes, licenses or fees.\n\n3. All surcharge amounts imposed by this section shall be deposited to the credit of the second injury fund.\n\n4. Such surcharge amounts shall be paid quarterly by insurers and self-insurers, and insurers shall pay the amounts not later than the thirtieth day of the month following the end of the quarter in which the amount is received from policyholders. If the director of the division of workers' compensation fails to calculate the surcharge by the thirty-first day of October of any year for the following year, any increase in the surcharge ultimately set by the director shall not be effective for any calendar quarter beginning less than sixty days from the date the director makes such determination.\n\n5. If a policyholder or self-insured fails to make payment of the surcharge or an insurer fails to make timely transfer to the division of surcharges actually collected from policyholders, as required by this section, a penalty of one-half of one percent of the surcharge unpaid, or untransferred, shall be assessed against the liable policyholder, self-insured or insurer. Penalties assessed under this subsection shall be collected in a civil action by a summary proceeding brought by the director of the division of workers' compensation.\n\n*6. Notwithstanding subsection 2 of this section to the contrary, the director of the division of workers' compensation shall collect a supplemental surcharge not to exceed one percent for calendar years 2014 to 2026 of the policyholder's or self-insured's workers' compensation net deposits, net premiums, or net assessments for the previous policy year, rounded up to the nearest one-quarter of a percentage point. All policyholders and self-insurers shall be notified by the division of the supplemental surcharge percentage to be imposed for such period of time as part of the notice provided in subsection 2 of this section.

Upon incorporation and adoption of bylaws, all individual self-insurers, as defined in section 287.280, other than individual public sector self-insurers and individual and public group self-insurers, as defined in section 287.280 and section 537.620, shall be and remain members of the corporation as a condition of their authority to individually self-insure in this state. The corporation shall perform its functions under a plan of operation as established and approved in section 287.870 and shall exercise its powers and duties through a board of directors as established in section 287.862. The corporation shall have those powers granted or permitted general not-for-profit corporations, as provided for in chapter 355.\n\n2. A member may voluntarily withdraw from the corporation when the member voluntarily terminates the self-insurance privilege and pays all assessments due to the date of such termination. However, the withdrawing member shall continue to be bound by the provisions of sections 287.860 to 287.885 relating to the period of its membership and any claims charged pursuant thereto. The withdrawing member, who is or shall become a member on or after the incorporation, shall also be required to provide to the division of workers' compensation, hereinafter referred to as \"the division\" upon withdrawal, and at twelve-month intervals thereafter, satisfactory proof that it continues to meet the standards of section 287.280 or the rules promulgated by the division under chapter 287 in relation to claims incurred while the withdrawing member exercised the privilege of self-insurance. Such reporting shall continue until the withdrawing member satisfies the division that there is no remaining value to claims incurred while the withdrawing member was self-insured. If, during this reporting period, the withdrawing member fails to meet the standards of section 287.280 or the rules promulgated by the division under chapter 287, the withdrawing member who is a member on or after the incorporation, may at six-month intervals or other agreed upon intervals thereafter be required by the division or by the corporation to provide to the division and to the corporation the certified opinion of an independent actuary who is a member of the American Society of Actuaries of the actuarial present value of the determined and estimated future compensation payments of the members for claims incurred while the member was a self-insurer. With each such opinion, the withdrawing member shall deposit with the division security in an amount equal to the value certified by the actuary and of a type that is acceptable for qualifying security deposits under section 287.280. The withdrawing member shall continue to provide such opinions and to provide such security until such time as the latest opinion shows no remaining value of claims. The corporation has a cause of action against a withdrawing member, and against any successor of a withdrawing member, who fails to timely provide the required opinion or who fails to maintain the required deposit with the division. The corporation shall be entitled to recover a judgment in the amount of the actuarial present value of the determined and estimated future compensation payments of the withdrawing member for claims incurred during the time that the withdrawing member exercised the privilege of self-insurance, together with reasonable attorney's fees and all costs pertaining thereto. For purposes of sections 287.860 to 287.885, the\"successor of a withdrawing member\"means any person, business entity, or group of persons or business entities, which holds or acquires legal or beneficial title to the majority of the assets or the majority of the shares of the withdrawing member.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 975)",

Moneys collected by or on behalf of the division of workers' compensation and dispersed to the corporation shall be vested in the corporation and shall not thereafter be deemed state property and shall not thereafter be subject to appropriation by the legislature, the treasurer, or any other state agency.\n\n2. All moneys in the insolvency fund, exclusive of administrative costs reasonably necessary to conduct the business of the corporation, as determined at the discretion of the board, as described in section 287.867, shall be used solely to compensate persons entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits from a Missouri self-insurer which is unable to meet its workers' compensation benefit obligations and to defray the expenses of the fund.\n\n3. The board of directors of the corporation shall direct the investment of the moneys in the fund, and all returns on the investments shall be retained in the fund. The corporation shall, at the request of the director of the division, annually submit to an audit by an independent certified public accountant or by such other person or persons as the director deems sufficient, and a copy of the audit report shall be transmitted to the Missouri division of workers' compensation and to the corporation.\n\n4. The board of directors of the corporation shall, based on such information as is reasonably available, report to the director of the division upon all matters germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any workers' compensation self-insurer and such reports shall not be deemed public documents under the provisions of section 610.010 or any other law.\n\n5. Upon creation of the insolvency fund pursuant to the provisions of section 287.867, the corporation is obligated for payment of compensation under this chapter to insolvent members' employees resulting from incidents and injuries to the extent of covered claims existing prior to the issuance of an order of liquidation against the member employer with a finding of insolvency which has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the member employer's state of domicile or of this state under the provisions of sections 375.950 to 375.990 in which the order of liquidation has not been stayed or been the subject of a writ of supersedeas or other comparable order; or prior to the date of determination by the board of directors that the member employer has fully expended all surety bonds, insurance or reinsurance, and all other available assets and is not able to pay compensation benefits at that time. All incidents giving rise to claims for compensation under this chapter must occur during the year in which such insolvent member is a member of the guaranty fund and was assessable pursuant to the plan of operation, except as provided for certain claims existing prior to August 28, 1992, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 7 of this section, and the employee must make timely claim for such payments according to procedures set forth by a court of competent jurisdiction over the delinquency or bankruptcy proceedings of the insolvent member. Any proceeds derived by such claim of the employee in bankruptcy shall be an offset of any amounts due and owing to the employee under the workers' compensation law. Any such obligation of the corporation includes only the amount due the injured worker or workers of the insolvent member under this chapter. In no event is the corporation obligated to a claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent member employer. The corporation shall be deemed the insolvent employer for purposes of this chapter to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and, to such extent, shall have all the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent employer as if the employer had not become insolvent. However, in no event shall the corporation be liable for any penalties or interest. The division, upon notice of a self-insured member filing bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution, shall notify in writing any employee of the self-insured member, who has an open claim for compensation or first report of injury filed with the division, at that employee's last known address of his or her obligation to file a proof of claim with the court of jurisdiction and of the need of the employee to provide the guaranty fund and the division with the records set out in this section. Any claimant claiming benefits under this chapter against an insolvent self-insured member of the Missouri Private Sector and Individual Guaranty Corporation shall, before the division of workers' compensation for the state of Missouri attaches jurisdiction, file with the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy of the self-insured employer, a proof of claim or other claim forms required by the appropriate bankruptcy court to secure a claim against the bankrupt employer. Any such claimant shall provide to the Missouri private sector self-insurance guaranty corporation and to the division of workers' compensation a copy, certified by the bankruptcy court, attesting to the filing of such claim or claim forms. Certification shall include the date of alleged loss alleged against the bankrupt employer; description of injuries claimed; and date the claim or claims were filed with the bankruptcy court. Failure of the claimant to provide such information shall bar the division from invoking jurisdiction over any matter for which an employee may otherwise be entitled to benefits under this chapter.\n\n6. The corporation may:\n\n(1) Request that the director revoke any member employer's authority to act as a qualified private sector individual self-insurer if the self-insurer member fails to maintain membership in the corporation or fails to pay the assessments levied by the division under sections 287.860 to 287.885;\n\n(2) Sue or be sued, including appearing in, prosecuting or defending and appealing any action on a claim brought by or against the corporation. The corporation shall have full rights of subrogation against any source of payment or reimbursement for payments by the corporation on behalf of a Missouri workers' compensation self-insurer. The corporation shall have a right of recovery through the maintenance of an action against any third party, other than a coemployee, who is in any way responsible or liable for injury or death to a covered worker. The corporation is also authorized to take all necessary action, including bringing an action at law or in equity to seek any available relief, including any action against any workers' compensation self-insurer, where the self-insurer has not paid all assessments levied by the division or the board of directors of the corporation. If the corporation is required to bring an action at law or in equity to enforce any obligations, rights or duties as regards a workers' compensation self-insurer, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the corporation;\n\n(3) Employ or retain such persons, including utilization of an in-house or a third-party administrator, fund manager, attorney, certified public accountant, auditor or other such person, and sufficient clerical staff, experts, professional staff and equipment, including sharing clerical staff and other costs with the division upon a mutually agreed upon paid basis, as are necessary to handle the claims and perform other duties of the corporation;\n\n(4) Borrow funds, including authority to issue bonds or purchase excess or any appropriate insurance or reinsurance, necessary to effectuate the purposes of sections 287.860 to 287.885 or to protect the assets of this fund and the members of the board and their employees in accordance with the plan of operation;\n\n(5) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts and perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of sections 287.860 to 287.885;\n\n(6) Become members of any trade association whose purpose includes furthering the understanding of the self-insurance industry in the state of Missouri, including the National Council of Self-Insurers, or other appropriate state, regional or national organizations;\n\n(7) Review, on its own motion, or at the request of the director, all applications for initial and for membership renewal in the corporation, including financial or other appropriate background studies, actuarial studies, and other information or guidelines as may be necessary to ensure that the member is fully complying with the privileges of self-insurance. It shall be the primary duty of the division to provide adequate staff and equipment and technical assistance to thoroughly review initial applications and membership renewals through budgeted funds and initial applications and membership renewal application fees. The corporation, however, shall have the right to, in difficult cases or situations where the work load cannot be adequately done without the help of the corporation, to assist in any assessment of any applicant;\n\n(8) Issue opinions prior to a final determination by the division of workers' compensation as to whether or not to approve any applicant for membership in the corporation, to the division concerning any applicant, which opinions shall be considered by the division;\n\n(9) Charge an applicant, in addition to the applicant's assessment, for initial or membership renewal in the corporation, a fee sufficient to cover the actual cost of examining the financial and safety conditions of the applicant.\n\n7. To the extent necessary to secure funds for the payment of covered claims and also to pay the reasonable costs to administer them, the division, upon certification of the board of directors, shall levy assessments based on the annual modified standard premium, provided that no such assessments shall ever exceed, in the aggregate, from all members, an amount in excess of one million dollars at any given time, exclusive of all new members' assessments in the amounts collected for same, as is set forth in the plan of operation pursuant to the provisions of section 287.870. Such assessments shall be made at a maximum annual assessment of one-sixth of one percent of the annual modified standard premium. The initial assessment shall be for an amount equal to six hundred thousand dollars, the amount of such fee to be levied over a three-year period, one-third of the six hundred thousand dollars to be collected and received the first year, one-third to be collected and received in the second year, and one-third to be collected and received in the third year, the first year to commence as of the date of incorporation, assessments to be prorated on an annualized basis. The director of the division shall annually certify to the corporation the assessment percentage due from the members of the corporation. The director of the division and the board of the corporation shall within the procedures as specified in this section and as established for the premium tax billings, as provided in sections 287.690, 287.710, 287.715 and 287.730, notify, assess, and receive the assessments due from those members for the prior calendar year ending on the thirty-first day of December, with the exception that this annual assessment shall be payable in full on or before the first day of March directly to the corporation. The department of commerce and insurance shall make available to the corporation or director of the division data on the self-insured employer's workers' compensation administrative tax data for use in verification of the assessment as provided in this section. If assessments provided in this section are not paid, the corporation shall certify the fact to the division. Out of the first amounts assessed, there shall be set aside an amount equal to fifty thousand dollars, which shall be applied retroactively, before August 28, 1992, to be used and applied for the benefit of employees who have open, outstanding claims, in existence, which have not already been fully and completely settled or for which there has been an award of judgment rendered, and for which there are moneys due and owing. The amount of payment and allocation of funds shall be within the exclusive discretion of the director, such payments to be made on a reasonably timely basis, as the director received funds for such purpose. In addition, there shall be no reassessments against any member unless the director feels the current balance of the fund is insufficient or, after deducting the amount paid for or reserved for outstanding claims and for administrative and other costs in managing the corporation, the amount held shall be less than four hundred thousand dollars, at which point the director shall raise assessments sufficient to bring the minimum amount of the fund back up to six hundred thousand dollars or such other amount not to exceed, in any event, one million dollars based upon a maximum annual assessment of one-sixth of one percent of the annual modified standard premium as shall be necessary to effectuate the purposes of the corporation at that time.\n\n8. Every assessment shall be made on a uniform percentage of the figure applicable, provided that the assessment levied against any self-insurer in any one year shall not exceed one-sixth of one percent of the annual modified standard premium during the calendar year preceding the date of the assessment. Assessments shall be remitted to and administered by the board of directors in the manner specified by the approved plan. Each employer so assessed shall have at least thirty days' written notice as to the date the assessment is due and payable. The corporation shall levy assessments against any newly admitted member of the corporation on the basis of contribution under the plan of operation as provided in section 287.870 and the applicable rules and regulations established pursuant thereto.\n\n9. If, in any one year, funds available from such assessments, together with funds previously raised, are not sufficient to make all the payments or reimbursements then owing, the funds available shall be prorated, and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as sufficient additional funds become available.\n\n10. No state funds of any kind shall be allocated or paid to the corporation or any of its accounts except those state funds accruing to the corporation by and through the assignment of rights of any insolvent employer.\n\n11. All moneys, property and other assets received, owned or otherwise held by the corporation shall be held in such a way as to safeguard the corporation's ability to assure that the purpose and objectives of the corporation shall be advanced and that moneys needed to pay claims to employees of an individual insolvent self-insurer in the private sector shall be preserved.\n\n12. Income derived from the corporation assets and investments shall vest in the corporation and shall not inure, under any circumstances, to the benefit of any member, the division of workers' compensation or any of its employees, or any other party other than an employee. The corporation may reinvest that income as otherwise provided for investing corporation assets. All such investments of corporation income shall be made in such a way as to ensure the welfare of the employees of the private sector individual self-insurers that are financially unable to meet their workers' compensation benefit obligations. In the event that the corporation shall be dissolved, any surplus income previously held by the insolvency fund shall be held in trust for the benefit of the employees of insolvent private sector individual self-insurers in the state of Missouri.\n\n13. The corporation and the insolvency fund shall pay no dividends, rebates, interest, or otherwise distribute any corporation or fund income to any of its members.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 975, A.L. 1993 S.B. 251, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)",

The plan of operation, and any amendments thereto, shall take effect upon submission in writing to the director. If the board of directors fails to submit a plan by six months after August 28, 1992, or fails to make required amendments to the plan within thirty days, or such other date as the parties shall agree upon, thereafter, the division shall promulgate such rules as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this section.

Notice of claims to the receiver or liquidator of an insolvent employer shall be deemed notice to the corporation or its agent, and a list of such claims shall be submitted periodically to the corporation by the receiver or liquidator;\n\n(5) Establish regular places and times for meetings of the board of directors;\n\n(6) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the corporation and its agents and the board of directors;\n\n(7) Provide that any member employer aggrieved by any final action or decision of the corporation may appeal to the division within thirty days after the action or decision;\n\n(8) Provide notice to any member employer aggrieved by any final action or decision of the division of workers' compensation of its rights to appeal such action or decision;\n\n(9) Establish the procedures whereby recommendations of candidates for the board of directors shall be submitted to the division;\n\n(10) Promulgate any additional provisions or any additional procedures or regulations necessary or proper for the execution of any of the powers and duties of the corporation or of the division of workers' compensation, without prior formal hearing or notices, by either the corporation on its own motion, or by the division of workers' compensation by regulations implementing sections 287.860 to 287.885;\n\n(11) Establish procedures to ensure the cooperation of the board with the director and any of the employees of the division of workers' compensation whenever possible.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 975)",

The advisory organization, in addition to other activities not prohibited, may:\n\n(1) Develop statistical plans, including class definitions;\n\n(2) Collect statistical data from members, subscribers or any other source;\n\n(3) Prepare and distribute pure premium rate data, adjusted for loss development and loss trending, in accordance with its statistical plans as specified in subsection 2 of this section. Such data and adjustments should be in sufficient detail so as to permit insurers to modify such pure premiums based on their own rating methods or interpretations of underlying data;\n\n(4) Prepare and distribute manuals of rating rules and rating schedules that do not contain any rules or schedules including final rates of permitting calculation of final rates without information outside the manuals;\n\n(5) Distribute information that is filed with the director and open to public inspection;\n\n(6) Conduct research and collect statistics in order to discover, identify and classify information relating to causes or prevention of losses;\n\n(7) Prepare and file policy forms and endorsements and consult with members, subscribers and others relative to their use and application;\n\n(8) Collect, compile and distribute past and current prices of individual insurers if such information is made available to the general public;\n\n(9) Conduct research and collect information to determine the impact of benefit level changes on pure premium rates;\n\n(10) Prepare and distribute rules and rating values for the uniform experience rating plan.

The director of the department of commerce and insurance will allow pure premium rate data, adjusted for loss development and loss trending, to be distributed, upon filing with the director with a final distribution in a format which allows a comparison of such data, adjusted for loss development without any trend factor, with a trend factor developed by the advisory organization, and with a trend factor developed by the director, for each of the various job classifications. Such data may be used, at their option, by workers' compensation insurers, self-funded employers, or self-insured groups of employers, to determine their own final rates or charges for workers' compensation insurance coverage. The authority to establish such a reporting format shall not be interpreted as allowing the director of the department of commerce and insurance to set final rates where a competitive market exists under the provisions of sections 287.930 to 287.975.\n\n(L. 1993 S.B. 251 § 34, A.L. 2005 S.B. 1 & 130)",
