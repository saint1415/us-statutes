The written consent of the person to be adopted shall be required in all cases where the person sought to be adopted is fourteen years of age or older, except where the court finds that such child has not sufficient mental capacity to give the same. In a case involving a child under fourteen years of age, the guardian ad litem shall ascertain the child's wishes and feelings about his or her adoption by conducting an interview or interviews with the child, if appropriate based on the child's age and maturity level, which shall be considered by the court as a factor in determining if the adoption is in the child's best interests.\n\n3.

The two adult witnesses shall not be the prospective adoptive parents or any attorney representing a party to the adoption proceeding other than the attorney representing the party signing the consent.

The written consent required in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section by the birth mother shall not be executed anytime before the child is forty-eight hours old.

Consents in all cases shall have been executed not more than six months prior to the date the petition for adoption is filed.\n\n7.

If a written consent is obtained after August 28, 1997, but prior to the development of a consent form by the department and the written consent complies with the provisions of subsection 8 of this section, such written consent shall be deemed valid.\n\n8. However, the consent form must specify that:\n\n(1) The birth parent understands the importance of identifying all possible fathers of the child and may provide the names of all such persons; and\n\n(2) The birth parent understands that if he denies paternity, but consents to the adoption, he waives any future interest in the child.\n\n9. The written consent to adoption required by subsection 3 and executed through procedures set forth in subsection 5 of this section shall be valid and effective even though the parent consenting was under eighteen years of age, if such parent was represented by a guardian ad litem, at the time of the execution thereof.\n\n10. Where the person sought to be adopted is eighteen years of age or older, his or her written consent alone to his or her adoption shall be sufficient.\n\n11. A birth parent, including a birth parent less than eighteen years of age, shall have the right to legal representation. In addition, the court may appoint an attorney to represent a birth parent less than eighteen years of age if:\n\n(1) A birth parent requests representation;\n\n(2) The court finds that hiring an attorney to represent such birth parent would cause a financial hardship for the birth parent; and\n\n(3) The birth parent is not already represented by counsel.\n\n12.

The agreement shall include:\n\n(1) An acknowledgment by the birth parents that the adoption is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parents do not abide by the post adoption contact agreement;\n\n(2) An acknowledgment by the adoptive parents that the agreement grants the birth parents the right to seek to enforce the provisions of the post adoption contact agreement. Remedies for a breach of the agreement shall include specific performance of the terms of the agreement; provided, that nothing in the agreement shall preclude a party seeking to enforce the agreement from utilizing child welfare mediation before, or in addition to, the commencement of a civil action for specific enforcement;\n\n(3) An acknowledgment that the post adoption contact agreement shall be filed with and approved by the court in order to be enforceable; and\n\n(4) An acknowledgment that the birth parents' consent to the adoption was not conditioned on the post adoption contact agreement and that acceptance of the agreement is fully voluntary.\n\n­­Upon completion of an adoption, further contact among the parties shall be at the discretion of the adoptive parents or in accordance with a post adoption contact agreement executed under this subsection. The court shall not have jurisdiction to deny an exchange of identifying information between an adoptive parent and a birth parent.\n\n5. Before the completion of an adoption, the court shall make available to the birth parent or parents a contact preference form developed by the state registrar pursuant to section 193.128 and provided to the court by the department of health and senior services. If a birth parent chooses to complete the form, the clerk of the court shall send the form with the certificate of decree of adoption to the state registrar. Such form shall accompany the original birth certificate of the adopted person and may be updated by a birth parent at any time upon the request of the birth parent.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 9613, A.L. 1947 V.

In re Wines' Adoption (A.), 239 S.W.2d 101.\n\n(1955) Lawful custody of minor child must be awarded by an appropriate court and it must appear that petitioners have had actual custody at least nine months before a decree of adoption can be granted. Thus, where petitioners had actual custody without court order, court could make order as to custody and hold petition for adoption in abeyance for nine months.

If, within three months, the child-placing agency or juvenile court personnel reports to the court that it has notified the biological parent pursuant to subsection 5 of this section, the court shall receive the identifying information from the child-placing agency. If an affidavit duly executed by a biological parent authorizing the release of information is filed with the court or if a biological parent is found to be deceased, the court shall disclose the identifying information as to that biological parent to the adopted adult or the adopted adult's lineal descendants if the adopted adult is deceased, provided that the other biological parent either:\n\n(1) Is unknown;\n\n(2) Is known but cannot be found and notified pursuant to subsection 5 of this section;\n\n(3) Is deceased; or\n\n(4) Has filed with the court an affidavit authorizing release of identifying information.\n\n­­If the biological parent fails or refuses to file an affidavit with the court authorizing the release of identifying information, then the identifying information shall not be released to the adopted adult.

Any adopted adult whose adoption was finalized in this state or whose biological parents had their parental rights terminated in this state may request the court to secure and disclose identifying information concerning an adult sibling. Identifying information pertaining exclusively to the adult sibling, whether part of the permanent record of a file in the court or in an agency, shall be released only upon consent of that adult sibling.\n\n10. The central office of the children's division within the department of social services shall maintain a registry by which biological parents, adult siblings, and adoptive adults may indicate their desire to be contacted by each other. The division may request such identification for the registry as a party may possess to assure positive identifications. At the time of registry, a biological parent or adult sibling may consent in writing to the release of identifying information to an adopted adult. If such a consent has not been executed and the division believes that a match has occurred on the registry between biological parents or adult siblings and an adopted adult, an employee of the division shall make the confidential contact provided in subsection 5 of this section with the biological parents or adult siblings and with the adopted adult. If the division believes that a match has occurred on the registry between one biological parent or adult sibling and an adopted adult, an employee of the division shall make the confidential contact provided by subsection 5 of this section with the biological parent or adult sibling. The division shall then attempt to make such confidential contact with the other biological parent, and shall proceed thereafter to make such confidential contact with the adopted adult only if the division determines that the other biological parent meets one of the conditions specified in subsection 7 of this section. The biological parent, adult sibling, or adopted adult may refuse to go forward with any further contact between the parties when contacted by the division.\n\n11.

Stepparent required to support stepchild — recovery from natural or adoptive parent, when — stepparent's income considered in aid to dependent children. —1. A stepparent shall support his or her stepchild to the same extent that a natural or adoptive parent is required to support his or her child so long as the stepchild is living in the same home as the stepparent. However, nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating or in any way diminishing the duty a parent otherwise would have to provide child support, and no court shall consider the income of a stepparent, or the amount actually provided for a stepchild by a stepparent, in determining the amount of child support to be paid by a natural or adoptive parent.\n\n2. A natural or adoptive parent shall be liable to a stepparent for the sum of money expended by a stepparent for the support of a stepchild when that sum of money was expended because of the neglect or refusal of the natural or adoptive parent to pay any part of or all of the court-ordered amount of support.\n\n3.

Interstate adoption assistance compact adopted — text of compact — false claims, penalty. —The \"Interstate Adoption Assistance Compact\" is hereby enacted into law authorizing the department of social services to enter into interstate agreements with agencies of other states for the protection of children on behalf of whom adoption assistance is being provided by the state of Missouri.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds that:\n\n1. Finding adoptive families for children for whom state assistance is desirable, pursuant to the state adoption subsidy programs, and assuring the protection of the interests of the children affected during the entire assistance period, require special measures when the adoptive parents move to other states or are residents of another state; and\n\n2. Provision of medical and other necessary services for children with state assistance encounters special difficulties when the provision of services takes place in other states.\n\n(b) The purposes of this section are:\n\n1. Authorize the department of social services to enter into interstate agreements with agencies of other states for the protection of children on behalf of whom adoption assistance is being provided by the department; and\n\n2. Provide procedures for interstate children's adoption assistance payments, including medical payments.\n\n1. The department of social services may develop, participate in the development of, negotiate and enter into one or more interstate compacts on behalf of this state with other states to implement one or more of the purposes set forth in this chapter. When so entered into, and for so long as it shall remain in force, such a compact shall have the force and effect of law.\n\n2. As used in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following terms have the following meanings.\n\nA.\"Adoption assistance state\"means the state that is signatory to an adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.\n\nB.\"State\"means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or a territory or possession of or administered by the United States.\n\nC.\"Residence state\"means the state of which the child is a resident by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.\n\nArticle III\n\n1. A compact entered into pursuant to the authority conferred by this section shall have the following content:\n\nA. A provision making it available for joinder by all states;\n\nB. A provision or provisions for withdrawal from the compact upon written notice to the parties, but with a period of one year between the date of the notice and the effective date of the withdrawal;\n\nC. A requirement that the protection afforded by or pursuant to the compact continue in force for the duration of the adoption assistance and be applicable to all children and their adoptive parents who, on the effective date of the withdrawal, are receiving adoption assistance from a party state other than the one in which they are resident and have their principal place of abode;\n\nD. A requirement that each instance of adoption assistance to which the compact applies be covered by an adoption assistance agreement in writing between the adoptive parents and the state child welfare agency of the state which undertakes to provide the adoption assistance and that any such agreement be expressly for the benefit of the adopted child and enforceable by the adoptive parents and the state agency providing the adoption assistance; and\n\nE. Such other provisions as may be appropriate to implement the proper administration of the compact.\n\n1. A compact entered into pursuant to the authority conferred by this section may contain provisions in addition to those required pursuant to Article III as follows:\n\nA. Provisions establishing procedures and entitlements to medical, developmental, child care or other social services for the child in accordance with applicable laws, even though the child and the adoptive parents are in a state other than the one responsible for or providing the services or the funds to defray part or all of the costs thereof; and\n\nB. Such other provisions as may be appropriate or incidental to the proper administration of the compact.\n\n1. A child resident in this state who is the subject of an adoption assistance agreement with another state shall be entitled to receive a medical assistance identification from this state, upon the filing in the department of a certified copy of the adoption assistance agreement obtained from the adoption assistance state. In accordance with regulations of the department of social services, the adoptive parents shall be required at least annually to show that the agreement is still in force or has been renewed.\n\n2. The department of social services shall consider the holder of a medical assistance identification pursuant to this Article as any other holder of a medical assistance identification under the laws of this state and shall process and make payment on claims on account of that holder in the same manner and pursuant to the same conditions and procedures as for other recipients of medical assistance.\n\n3. The department of social services shall provide coverage and benefits for a child who is in another state and who is covered by an adoption assistance agreement made by the department of social services for the coverage or benefits, if any, not provided by the residence state. The adoptive parents acting for the child may submit evidence of payment for services or benefit amounts not payable in the residence state and shall be reimbursed. There shall be no reimbursement for services or benefit amounts covered under any insurance or other third-party medical contract or arrangement held by the child or the adoptive parents. The department of social services shall make rules implementing this subsection. The additional coverage and benefit amounts provided pursuant to this subsection shall be for services to the cost of which there is no federal contribution, or which, if federally aided, are not provided by the residence state. Among other things, the regulations shall include procedures to be followed in obtaining prior approvals for services in those instances where required for the assistance.\n\n4. The submission of any claim for payment or reimbursement for services or benefits, pursuant to this Article or the making of any statement in connection therewith, which claim or statement the maker knows or should know to be false, misleading or fraudulent shall be punishable as perjury and subject to the provisions of the Missouri Criminal Code and other applicable laws.\n\n5. The provisions of this section shall apply only to medical assistance for children under adoption assistance agreements from states that have entered into a compact with this state under which the other state provides medical assistance to children under adoption assistance agreements made by this state. All other children entitled to medical assistance, pursuant to adoption assistance agreements entered into by this state, shall be eligible to receive it in accordance with the laws and procedures applicable thereto.\n\nConsistent with federal law, the department of social services in connection with the administration of this Article and any compact pursuant to this section, shall include in any state plan made pursuant to the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, Public Law 96-272, Titles IV-E and XIX of the United States Social Security Act, and any other applicable federal laws, the provision of adoption assistance and medical assistance for which the federal government pays some or all of the cost. The department of social services shall apply for and administer all relevant federal aid, in accordance with law.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 366, et al. § 2)",
