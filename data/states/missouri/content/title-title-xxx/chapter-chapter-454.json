If the division provides assistance to another state in such a case, neither this state nor the requesting state shall consider the case to be transferred to its caseload, but the division may establish a corresponding case based on such other state's request for assistance. The division shall maintain records of the number of such interstate requests for assistance, the number of cases for which support was collected and the amounts of such collections. The division is authorized to transmit to another state, by electronic or other means, a request for assistance in a case involving the enforcement of a support order.

If there has been an assignment to the family support division and there is no current assignment to another state's IV-A agency, the clerk of the court shall forward to the obligee all payments for support accruing subsequent to the termination and shall forward to the department of social services all payments for support which had accrued and were unpaid at the time of the termination.

IV-D agency, defined — clerk of court or family support payment center to serve as trustee, when, duties — termination of trustee responsibilities by division, procedure. —1. For the purposes of this section, the term\"IV-D agency\"means an agency that has been designated by a state to administer programs pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act or any other entity entitled to receive and disburse child support payments in that state.\n\n2. When a court has ordered support payments to a person who is receiving child support services pursuant to section 454.425, or pursuant to application for IV-D agency services in another state, the family support division shall so notify the court. Until October 1, 1999, upon such notice the court shall order all support payments to be made to the clerk of the court as trustee for such person. The notification to the court by the division shall, in and of itself, authorize the court to make the clerk trustee, notwithstanding any provision of any existing court order, statute, or other law to the contrary, and the court need not hold a hearing on the matter. The clerk shall keep an accurate record of such orders and such payments, and shall report all such collections to the division in the manner specified by the division. The circuit clerk shall forward all such payments to the person receiving child support services pursuant to section 454.425, or to the IV-D agency in the state in which the person is currently receiving IV-D services, as appropriate. Effective October 1, 1999, upon notice by the division, all support payments shall be made to the payment center pursuant to section 454.530 as trustee for such person. The notification by the division shall, in and of itself, authorize the payment center pursuant to section 454.530 to be trustee, notwithstanding any provision of any existing court order or state law to the contrary, and the court shall not be required to hold a hearing on the matter. The payment center shall keep an accurate record of such orders and payments, and shall report all such collections to the division in a manner specified by the division. The payment center shall forward all such payments to the person receiving child support services pursuant to section 454.425 or to the IV-D agency in the state in which the person is currently receiving IV-D services, as appropriate.\n\n3. The division is authorized to terminate trusteeship responsibilities for future support in IV-D cases pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. If the division determines that the order no longer provides a continuing obligation for support or the custodial party is no longer receiving child support enforcement services, the division shall send a notice of its intent to terminate the trusteeship by regular mail to the custodial and noncustodial parties. The notice shall advise each party that unless written objection is received by the division within fifteen days of the date the notice is sent, the trusteeship for current support shall be terminated. Unless a party objects to the termination of the trusteeship in writing within the specified period, the division shall terminate the trusteeship for current support.\n\n4. If an objection is filed by either party to the case, the trusteeship may be terminated for future support only upon the filing of a motion with the court in which the trusteeship is established and after notice to all parties and hearing on the motion.\n\n5. If the requirements of subsection 3 of this section have been met, the trusteeship responsibilities for future support shall terminate. The trusteeship shall remain in effect only to the extent that payments are made to satisfy any accrued unpaid support that was due as of the date of the notice. The notice shall, in and of itself, terminate the trusteeship responsibilities for future support, and the court need not hold a hearing on the matter.\n\n6.

Support money owed state due, when, failure to pay within time limit, rights of family services — agreements for collection of support, invalid, when, fee allowed person making collection, when, amount — depriving division of support payments, penalty. —1. Whenever a custodian of a child, or other person, receives support moneys paid to him or her, which moneys are paid in whole or in part in satisfaction of a support obligation which is owed to the family support division under subsection 2 of section 454.465, or which has been assigned to the family support division under subsection 2 of section 208.040, the moneys shall be remitted to the department of social services within ten days of receipt by such custodian or other person. If not so remitted, such custodian or other person shall be indebted to the department in an amount equal to the amount of the support money received and not remitted. By not paying over the moneys to the department, such custodian or other person is deemed, without the necessity of signing any document, to have made an irrevocable assignment to the family support division of any support delinquency owed which is not already assigned to the family support division or to any support delinquency which may accrue in the future in an amount equal to the amount of the support money retained. The department may utilize any available administrative or legal process to collect the assigned delinquency to effect recoupment and satisfaction of the debt incurred by reason of the failure of such custodian or other person to remit. The department is also authorized to make a setoff to effect satisfaction of the debt by deduction from support moneys in its possession or in the possession of any clerk of the court or other forwarding agent which would otherwise be payable to such custodian or other person for the satisfaction of any support delinquency. Nothing in this section authorizes the department to make a setoff as to current support paid during the month for which the payment is due and owing.\n\n2. A custodian of a child, or other person, who has made an assignment of support rights to the family support division shall not make any agreement with any private attorney or other person regarding the collection of assigned support obligations without approval of the department of social services. If any private attorney or other person who in good faith and without knowledge of such assignment collects all or part of the assigned support obligations, any agreement regarding the distribution of the proceeds of the assigned support obligations by such private attorney or other person shall not bind the department; provided, however, the department shall be liable to such private attorney or other person for a fee computed in accordance with subsection 3 of this section. When a private attorney or other person has begun to collect a support obligation, and thereafter a notice of assignment of support rights to the division is filed with the court pursuant to section 454.415, notice of such assignment shall be given to that attorney or other person as provided by supreme court rule 43.01.\n\n3. (1) Where an assignment of support rights has been made to the family support division but notice of such assignment was not filed with the court pursuant to section 454.415, a private attorney who in good faith and without knowledge of such assignment collects all or part of such assigned support obligation shall be awarded by the department a fee of twenty-five percent of the support obligation collected. Such fees shall be paid out of state funds in lieu of federal funds.\n\n(2) Where an assignment of support rights has been made to the family support division and notice of the assignment was not filed with the court pursuant to section 454.415 until after the private attorney has begun collection proceedings, a private attorney who collects assigned support obligations shall be awarded a fee, as the court shall determine, based upon the time expended, but in no event shall the fee exceed twenty-five percent of the support obligation collected.\n\n(3) Where no assignment of support rights has been made to the family support division until after the private attorney has collected any part of the support obligation, no recoupment shall be had by the department of the portion collected, and the fee awarded to the private attorney or other person shall be the fee negotiated between the client and the private attorney or other person.\n\n4. A person commits the crime of stealing, as defined by section 570.030, if such person takes, obtains, uses, transfers, conceals, or retains possession of child support payments which have been assigned to the family support division with the purpose to deprive the division thereof, either without the consent of the division or by means of deceit or coercion.\n\n(L. 1982 S.B. 468 § 11, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1272, et al., A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)",

The amount of the state debt shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) Where there exists a court order directed to a parent which covers that parent's support obligation to a dependent during a period in which the family support division provided public assistance to or for the benefit of that dependent, the state debt of that parent shall be an amount equal to the obligation ordered by the court, including arrearages and unpaid medical expenses, up to the full amount of public assistance paid; or\n\n(2) Where no court order covers a parent's support obligation to a dependent during a period in which the family support division provided public assistance to or for the benefit of that dependent, the state debt may be set or reset by the director in an amount not to exceed the amount of public assistance so provided by the family support division.\n\n2.

The director may issue a notice and finding of financial responsibility to a parent who owes a state debt or who is responsible for the support of a child on whose behalf the custodian of that child is receiving support enforcement services from the division pursuant to section 454.425 if a court order has not been previously entered against that parent, a court order has been previously entered but has been terminated by operation of law or if a support order from another state has been entered but is not entitled to recognition under sections 454.850 to 454.997*.

For purposes of this subsection, a parent who refuses receipt of service by certified mail is deemed to have been served.

Any time limits for notices or requests may be extended by the director, and such extension shall have no effect on the jurisdiction of the court, administrative body, or other entity having jurisdiction over the proceedings.\n\n4. If a timely written response setting forth objections and requesting a hearing is received by the appropriate division office, and if such response raises a factual question requiring the submission of evidence, a hearing shall be held in the manner provided by section 454.475. If no timely written response and request for hearing is received by the appropriate division office, the director may enter an order in accordance with the notice, and shall specify:\n\n(1) The amount of periodic support to be paid, with directions on the manner of payment;\n\n(2) The amount of state debt, if any, accrued in favor of the department;\n\n(3) The monthly payment to be made on state debt, if any;\n\n(4) The amount of costs of collection, including attorney's fees, assessed against the parent;\n\n(5) The name of the person or agency with custody of the dependent child and the name and birth date of the dependent child for whom support is to be paid;\n\n(6) That the property of the parent is subject to collection actions, including, but not limited to, wage withholding, garnishment, liens, and execution thereon; and\n\n(7) If appropriate, that the parent shall provide medical insurance for the dependent child, or shall pay the reasonable and necessary medical expenses of the dependent child.\n\n5.

The order is final, and action by the director to enforce and collect upon the order, including arrearages, may be taken from the date of issuance of the order.\n\n6. Copies of the orders issued pursuant to this section shall be mailed within fourteen days of the issuance of the order.\n\n7. Any parent or person having custody of the child who is aggrieved as a result of any allegation or issue of fact contained in the notice and finding of financial responsibility shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing, upon the request in writing filed with the director not more than twenty days after service of the notice and finding is made upon such parent or person having custody of the child, and if in requesting such hearing, the aggrieved parent or person having custody of the child raises a factual issue requiring the submission of evidence.\n\n8.

A hearing on the motion shall then be provided in the same manner, and determinations shall be based on considerations set out in section 454.475, unless the party served fails to respond within thirty days, in which case the director may enter an order by default. If the child for whom the order applies is no longer in the custody of a person receiving public assistance or receiving support enforcement services from the department, or a division thereof, pursuant to section 454.425, the director may certify the matter for hearing to the circuit court in which the order was filed pursuant to section 454.490 in lieu of holding a hearing pursuant to section 454.475. If the director certifies the matter for hearing to the circuit court, service of the motion to modify shall be had in accordance with the provisions of subsection 5 of section 452.370. If the director does not certify the matter for hearing to the circuit court, service of the motion to modify shall be considered complete upon personal service, or on the date of mailing, if sent by certified mail. For the purpose of 42 U.S.C.

Modification may be granted only upon a showing of a change of circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unreasonable.

If the application of the guidelines and criteria set forth in supreme court rule 88.01 to the financial circumstances of the parties would result in a change of child support from the existing amount by twenty percent or more, then a prima facie showing has been made of a change of circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the present terms unreasonable.\n\n4.

In addition to any other remedy provided by law for the enforcement of support, if a support order has been entered, the director shall issue an order directing any employer or other payer of the parent to withhold and pay over to the division, the payment center pursuant to section 454.530 or the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which a trusteeship is or will be established, money due or to become due the obligated parent in an amount not to exceed federal wage garnishment limitations. For administrative child support orders issued pursuant to sections other than section 454.476, the director shall not issue an order to withhold and pay over in any case in which:\n\n(1) One of the parties demonstrates, and the director finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding. For purposes of this subdivision, any finding that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding shall be based on, at least, a written determination and an explanation by the director that implementing immediate wage withholding would not be in the best interests of the child and proof of timely payments of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of support orders; or\n\n(2) A written agreement is reached between the parties that provides for an alternative payment arrangement.­­If the income of an obligor is not withheld as of the effective date of the support order, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, or otherwise, such obligor's income shall become subject to withholding pursuant to this section, without further exception, on the date on which the obligor becomes delinquent in maintenance or child support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation.\n\n­­If the income of an obligor is not withheld as of the effective date of the support order, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, or otherwise, such obligor's income shall become subject to withholding pursuant to this section, without further exception, on the date on which the obligor becomes delinquent in maintenance or child support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation.\n\n2. An order entered pursuant to this section shall recite the amount required to be paid as continuing support, the amount to be paid monthly for arrearages and the Social Security number of the obligor if available. In addition, the order shall contain a provision that the obligor shall notify the family support division regarding the availability of medical insurance coverage through an employer or a group plan, provide the name of the insurance provider when coverage is available, and inform the division of any change in access to such insurance coverage. A copy of section 454.460 and this section shall be appended to the order.\n\n3. An order entered pursuant to this section shall be served on the employer or other payer either by regular mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested or may be issued through electronic means, and shall be binding on the employer or other payer two weeks after mailing or electronic issuance of such service. A copy of the order and a notice of property exempt from withholding shall be mailed to the obligor at the obligor's last known address. The notice shall advise the obligor that the withholding has commenced and the procedures to contest such withholding pursuant to section 454.475 on the grounds that such withholding or the amount withheld is improper due to a mistake of fact by requesting a hearing thirty days from mailing the notice. At such a hearing the certified copy of the court order and the sworn or certified statement of arrearages shall constitute prima facie evidence that the director's order is valid and enforceable. If a prima facie case is established, the obligor may only assert mistake of fact as a defense. For purposes of this section,\"mistake of fact\"means an error in the amount of the withholding or an error as to the identity of the obligor. The obligor shall have the burden of proof on such issues. The obligor may not obtain relief from the withholding by paying the overdue support. The employer or other payer shall withhold from the earnings or other income of each obligor the amount specified in the order, and may deduct an additional sum not to exceed six dollars per month as reimbursement for costs, except that the total amount withheld shall not exceed the limitations contained in the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1673(b). The employer or other payer shall transmit the payments as directed in the order within seven business days of the date the earnings, money due or other income was payable to the obligor. For purposes of this section,\"business day\"means a day that state offices are open for regular business. The employer or other payer shall, along with the amounts transmitted, provide the date the amount was withheld from each obligor. If the order does not contain the Social Security number of the obligor, the employer or other payer shall not be liable for withholding from the incorrect obligor.\n\n4. If the order is served on a payer other than an employer, it shall be a lien against any money due or to become due the obligated parent which is in the possession of the payer on the date of service or which may come into the possession of the payer after service until further order of the director, except for any deposits held in two or more names in a financial institution.\n\n5. The division shall notify an employer or other payer upon whom such an order has been directed whenever all arrearages have been paid in full, and whenever, for any other reason, the amount required to be withheld and paid over to the payment center pursuant to the order as to future pay periods is to be reduced or redirected. If the parent's support obligation is required to be paid monthly and the parent's pay periods are at more frequent intervals, the employer or other payer may, at the request of the obligee or the director, withhold and pay over to the payment center an equal amount at each pay period cumulatively sufficient to comply with the withholding order.\n\n6. An order issued pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall be a continuing order and shall remain in effect and be binding upon any employer or other payer upon whom it is directed until a further order of the director. Such orders shall terminate when all children for whom the support order applies are emancipated or deceased, or the support obligation otherwise ends, and all arrearages are paid. No order to withhold shall be terminated solely because the obligor has fully paid arrearages.\n\n7. An order issued pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall have priority over any other legal process pursuant to state law against the same wages, except that where the other legal process is an order issued pursuant to this section or section 452.350, the processes shall run concurrently, up to applicable wage withholding limitations. If concurrently running wage withholding processes for the collection of support obligations would cause the amounts withheld from the wages of the obligor to exceed applicable wage withholding limitations and includes a wage withholding from another state pursuant to section 454.932, the employer shall first satisfy current support obligations by dividing the amount available to be withheld among the orders on a pro rata basis using the percentages derived from the relationship each current support order amount has to the sum of all current child support obligations. Thereafter, arrearages shall be satisfied using the same pro rata distribution procedure used for distributing current support, up to the applicable limitation. If concurrently running wage withholding processes for the collection of support obligations would cause the amounts withheld from the wages of the obligor to exceed applicable wage withholding limitations and does not include a wage withholding from another state pursuant to section 454.932, the employer shall withhold and pay to the payment center an amount equal to the wage withholding limitations. The payment center shall first satisfy current support obligations by dividing the amount available to be withheld among the orders on a pro rata basis using the percentages derived from the relationship each current support order amount has to the sum of all current child support obligations. Thereafter, arrearages shall be satisfied using the same pro rata distribution procedure used for distributing current support, up to the applicable limitation.\n\n8. No employer or other payer who complies with an order entered pursuant to this section shall be liable to the parent, or to any other person claiming rights derived from the parent, for wrongful withholding. An employer or other payer who fails or refuses to withhold or pay the amounts as ordered pursuant to this section shall be liable to the party holding the support rights in an amount equal to the amount which became due the parent during the relevant period and which, pursuant to the order, should have been withheld and paid over. The director is hereby authorized to bring an action in circuit court to determine the liability of an employer or other payer for failure to withhold or pay the amounts as ordered. If a court finds that a violation has occurred, the court may fine the employer in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars. The court may also enter a judgment against the employer for the amounts to be withheld or paid, court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n9. The remedy provided by this section shall be available where the state or any of its political subdivisions is the employer or other payer of the obligated parent in the same manner and to the same extent as where the employer or other payer is a private party.\n\n10. An employer shall not discharge, or refuse to hire or otherwise discipline, an employee as a result of an order to withhold and pay over certain money authorized by this section. If any such employee is discharged within thirty days of the date upon which an order to withhold and pay over certain money is to take effect, there shall arise a rebuttable presumption that such discharge was a result of such order. This presumption shall be overcome only by clear, cogent and convincing evidence produced by the employer that the employee was not terminated because of the order to withhold and pay over certain money. The director is hereby authorized to bring an action in circuit court to determine whether the discharge constitutes a violation of this subsection. If the court finds that a violation has occurred, the court may enter an order against the employer requiring reinstatement of the employee and may fine the employer in an amount not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars. Further, the court may enter judgment against the employer for the back wages, costs, attorney's fees, and for the amount of child support which should have been withheld and paid over during the period of time the employee was wrongfully discharged.\n\n11. If an obligor for whom an order to withhold has been issued pursuant to subsection 1 of this section terminates the obligor's employment, the employer shall, within ten days of the termination, notify the division of the termination, shall provide to the division the last known address of the obligor, if known to the employer, and shall provide to the division the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known. When the division determines the identity of the obligor's new employer, the director shall issue an order to the new employer as provided in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n12. If an employer or other payer is withholding amounts for more than one order issued pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the employer or other payer may transmit all such withholdings which are to be remitted to the same circuit clerk, other collection unit or to the payment center after October 1, 1999, as one payment together with a separate list identifying obligors for whom a withholding has been made and the amount withheld from each obligor so listed, and the withholding date or dates for each obligor.\n\n13. For purposes of this section,\"income\"means any periodic form of payment due to an individual, regardless of source, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, workers' compensation benefits, disability benefits, payments pursuant to a pension or a retirement program, and interest.\n\n14. The employer shall withhold funds as directed in the notice, except if an employer receives an income withholding order issued by another state, the employer shall apply the income withholding law of the state of the obligor's principal place of employment in determining:\n\n(1) The employer's fee for processing an income withholding order;\n\n(2) The maximum amount permitted to be withheld from the obligor's income;\n\n(3) The time periods within which the employer shall implement the income withholding order and forward the child support payments;\n\n(4) The priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees; and\n\n(5) Any withholding terms and conditions not specified in the order.\n\n15. If the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services promulgates a final standard format for an employer income withholding notice, the director shall use such notice prescribed by the secretary.\n\n(L. 1982 S.B. 468 § 22, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1275, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1987 H.B. 484, A.L. 1990 S.B. 834, A.L. 1993 S.B. 253, A.L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 1998 S.B. 910, A.L. 1999 S.B. 291, A.L. 2003 H.B. 613 merged with S.B. 330 merged with S.B. 471, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)\n\n(1994) Where statute prohibits employers from discharging employees in response to wage-withholding order to satisfy child support obligation, legislature did not clearly indicate its intent to establish private cause of action for employees against employers. The failure to expressly create a private cause of action gives rise to the implication that the division director of child support enforcement has that exclusive right to bring suit. Johnson v. Kraft General Foods, Inc., 885 S.W.2d 334 (Mo. banc).",

Financial institutions, division may request information, when, fees — definitions — data match system — notice of lien, procedure — jointly owners — fees — immunity from liability, when. —1. In addition to the authority of the division to request information pursuant to section 454.440, the division may request information from financial institutions pursuant to this section.\n\n2. As used in this section:\n\n(1)\"Account\"includes a demand deposit, checking or negotiable withdrawal order account, savings account, time deposit account or money market mutual fund account, or individual retirement account qualified pursuant to Section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(2)\"Encumbered assets\", the noncustodial parent's interest in an account which is encumbered by a lien arising by operation of law or otherwise;\n\n(3)\"Financial institution\"includes:\n\n(a) A depository institution as defined in Section 3(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1813(c));\n\n(b) An institution affiliated party as defined in Section 3(u) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1813(u));\n\n(c) Any federal credit union or state credit union, as defined in Section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1752), including an institution affiliated party of such a credit union as defined in Section 206(r) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1786(r)); or\n\n(d) Any benefit association, insurance company, safe deposit company, money market fund or similar entity authorized to do business in the state.\n\n3. The division and each financial institution doing business in this state shall enter into an agreement to develop and operate a data match system which uses automated exchanges to the maximum extent feasible, unless the financial institution does business in two or more states and enters into an agreement with the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement to effectuate a data match. Such agreements shall require the financial institution to provide to the division, for each calendar quarter, the name, record address, Social Security number or other taxpayer identification number, and other identifying information of each noncustodial parent who maintains an account at such institution and who owes past due support, as identified by the division by name and Social Security number or other taxpayer identification number. The financial institution shall only provide such information stated in this subsection that is readily available through existing data systems, and as such data systems are enhanced, solely at the financial institution's discretion and for its business purposes, the financial institution shall provide any original and additional information which becomes readily available for any new data match request.\n\n4. The division shall pay a reasonable fee to the financial institution for conducting the data match pursuant to this section, but such amount shall not exceed the costs incurred by the financial institution.\n\n5. The division or a IV-D agency may issue liens against any account in a financial institution and may release such liens.\n\n6. (1) If a notice of lien is received from the division or a IV-D agency, the financial institution shall immediately encumber the assets held by such institution on behalf of any noncustodial parent who is subject to such lien. However, if the account is in the name of a noncustodial parent and such parent's spouse or parent, the financial institution at its discretion may not encumber the assets and when it elects not to encumber such assets, shall so notify the division or IV-D agency. The amount of assets to be encumbered shall be stated in the notice and shall not exceed the amount of unpaid support due at the time of issuance. The financial institution shall, within ten business days of receipt of a notice of lien, notify the division or IV-D agency of the financial institution's response to the notice of lien.\n\n(2) Within ten business days of notification by the financial institution that assets have been encumbered, the division or IV-D agency shall notify by mail the noncustodial parent of the issuance of the lien and the reasons for such issuance. The notice shall advise the noncustodial parent of the procedures to contest such lien pursuant to section 454.475 by requesting a hearing within thirty days from the date the notice was mailed by the division to the noncustodial parent.\n\n7. (1) Except as provided in subsection 6 of this section, the interest of the noncustodial parent shall be presumed equal to all other joint owners, unless at least one of the joint owners provides the division or IV-D agency with a true copy of a written agreement entered prior to the date of issuance of notice of lien, or other clear and convincing evidence regarding the various ownership interests of the joint owners within thirty days of the division's or IV-D agency's mailing of the notice to the noncustodial parent. The financial institution shall only encumber the amount presumed to belong to the noncustodial parent. The division or IV-D agency may proceed to issue an order for the amount in the account presumed to belong to the noncustodial parent if no prior written agreement or other evidence is provided.\n\n(2) If a prior written agreement or other clear and convincing evidence is furnished to the division, and based on such agreement or evidence the division or IV-D agency determines that the interest of the noncustodial parent is less than the presumed amount, the division or IV-D agency shall amend the lien to reflect the amount in the account belonging to the noncustodial parent or shall release the lien if the noncustodial parent has no interest in the account. In no event shall the division or IV-D agency obtain more than the presumed amount of the account without a judicial determination that a greater amount of the account belongs to the noncustodial parent. The division or IV-D agency may by levy and execution on a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction seek to obtain an amount greater than the amount presumed to belong to the noncustodial parent upon proof that the noncustodial parent's interest is greater than the amount presumed pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, accounts are not joint accounts when the noncustodial parent has no legal right to the funds, but is either a contingent owner or agent. Such nonjoint accounts shall include, but are not limited to, a pay-on-death account or any other account in which the noncustodial parent owner may act as agent by a power of attorney or otherwise. Furthermore, when any account naming the noncustodial parent has not been disclosed to the noncustodial parent which is evidenced by a signature card or other deposit agreement not containing the signature of such noncustodial parent, then for the purposes of this subsection, such account shall not be treated as a joint account.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a financial institution shall not encumber any account of less than one hundred dollars.\n\n8. Upon service of an order to surrender issued pursuant to this section, any financial institution in possession of a jointly owned account may interplead such property as otherwise provided by law.\n\n9. Any other joint owner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a determination that the interests of the joint owners are disproportionate. The party filing the petition shall have the burden of proof on such a claim. If subject to the jurisdiction of the court, all persons owning affected accounts with a noncustodial parent shall be made parties to any proceeding to determine the respective interests of the joint owners. The court shall enter an appropriate order determining the various interests of each of the joint owners and authorizing payment against the obligor's share for satisfaction of the child support or maintenance obligation.\n\n10. The court may assess costs and reasonable attorney's fees against the noncustodial parent if the court determines that the noncustodial parent has an interest in the affected joint account.\n\n11. The division may order the financial institution to surrender all or part of the encumbered assets. The order shall not issue until sixty days after the notice of lien is sent to the financial institution. The financial institution shall, within seven days of receipt of the order, pay the encumbered amount as directed in the order to surrender.\n\n12. A financial institution shall not be liable pursuant to any state or federal law, including 42 U.S.C. Section 669A, to any person for:\n\n(1) Any disclosure of information to the division pursuant to this section;\n\n(2) Encumbering or surrendering any assets held by the financial institution in response to a lien or order pursuant to this section and notwithstanding any other provisions in this section to the contrary, encumbering or surrendering assets from any account in the financial institution connected in any way to the noncustodial parent; or\n\n(3) Any other action taken in good faith to comply with the requirements of this section.\n\n13. A financial institution that fails without due cause to comply with a notice of lien or order to surrender issued pursuant to this section shall be liable for the amount of the encumbered assets and the division may bring an action against the financial institution in circuit court for such amount. For purposes of this subsection,\"due cause\"shall include, but not be limited to, when a financial institution demonstrates to a court of competent jurisdiction that the institution established in good faith a routine to comply with the requirements of this section and that one or more transactions to enforce the lien or order to surrender were not completed due to an accidental error, a misplaced computer entry, or other accidental human or mechanical problems.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 2002 S.B. 895, A.L. 2019 H.B. 397)",

Interest shall accrue at the close of the business day on the last day of each month and shall be calculated by multiplying the total arrearage existing at the end of the day, less the amount of that month's installments, by the applicable rate of interest. The total amount of interest collectible is the sum of the interest which has accrued on the last day of each month following the first delinquent payment. This interest computation method shall apply to all support and maintenance orders, regardless of the frequency of the installments required by the court. If the order does not specify the date on which support or maintenance payments are to begin, it shall be assumed that the first installment was due on the date the order was entered, and subsequent installments fall due on the same day of the week, or date of the month, as is appropriate.

It shall not be the responsibility of the circuit clerk to compute the interest due and owing. The payment history affidavit and statement of interest shall be entered in the case record by the circuit clerk.

Whenever a parent or other person receives support moneys for a child paid to him or her by the family support division under the provisions of chapter 454, and the division subsequently determines that such payment, through no fault of the division, was erroneously made, either in good faith, or due to fraud or receipt of inaccurate information from the recipient of such support, such parent or other person shall be indebted to the division in an amount equal to the amount of the support money received by the parent or other person for that child. The division may utilize any available administrative or legal process to collect the erroneously paid support to effect recoupment and satisfaction of the debt incurred by reason of the failure of such parent or other person to reimburse the division for such erroneously paid child support. The division is also authorized to make a setoff to effect satisfaction of the debt by deduction from support moneys for that child in its possession or in the possession of any clerk of the court or other forwarding agent which would otherwise be payable to such parent or other person for the satisfaction of any support reimbursement.

Health benefit plan may be required — terms — order of coverage — liability for expenses not covered — abatement, termination of coverage. —1. At any state of a proceeding in which the circuit court or the division has jurisdiction to establish or modify an order for child support, including but not limited to actions brought pursuant to this chapter, chapters 210, 211, and 452, the court or the division shall determine whether to require a parent to provide medical care for the child through a health benefit plan.\n\n2. The court or the division may require that a child be covered under a health benefit plan that is accessible to the child. Such a requirement shall be imposed in any IV-D case. The court or division shall require that a child be covered under a private health benefit plan whenever such a health benefit plan is available at reasonable cost through a parent's employer or union. If a private health benefit plan is not available at reasonable cost through an employer or union, the court, in determining whether to require a parent to provide such coverage, shall consider:\n\n(1) The best interests of the child;\n\n(2) The child's present and anticipated needs for medical care;\n\n(3) The financial ability of the parents to afford the cost of a health benefit plan; and\n\n(4) The extent to which the cost of the health benefit plan is subsidized or reduced by participation on a group basis or otherwise.\n\n3. To the extent that such options are available under the terms of the health benefit plan, an order may specify required terms of the health benefit plan, including:\n\n(1) Minimum required policy limits;\n\n(2) Minimum required coverage;\n\n(3) Maximum terms for deductibles or required co-payments; or\n\n(4) Other significant terms, including, but not limited to, any provision required for a health benefit plan under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.\n\n4. If the child is not covered by a private health benefit plan but such a plan is available to one of the parents at a reasonable cost, the court or the division shall order that coverage under the health benefit plan be provided for the child, unless there is available to the other parent a private health benefit plan with comparable or better benefits at comparable or reduced cost. If private health benefit plans are available to both parents upon terms which provide comparable benefits and costs, the court or the division shall determine which health benefit plan, if any, shall be required, giving due regard to the possible advantages of each plan.\n\n5. The court shall require the obligor to be liable for all or a portion of the medical or dental expenses of the minor child that are not covered by the required health benefit plan coverage if:\n\n(1) The court finds that the health benefit plan coverage required to be obtained by the obligor or available to the obligee does not pay all the reasonable and necessary medical or dental expenses of the minor child; and\n\n(2) The court finds that the obligor has the financial resources to contribute to the payment of these medical or dental expenses; and\n\n(3) The court finds the obligee has substantially complied with the terms of the health benefit coverage.\n\n6. The cost of health benefit plan employee contributions or premiums shall not be a direct offset to child support awards established pursuant to this chapter, chapters 210, 211, and 452, but it shall be considered when determining the amount of child support to be paid by the obligor.\n\n7. If two or more health benefit plans are available to one or both parents that are complementary to one another or are compatible as primary and secondary coverage for the child, the court or the division may order each parent to maintain one or more health benefit plans for the child.\n\n8. Prior to terminating enrollment in a health benefit plan or changing from one health benefit plan to another, consideration by the court or division shall be given to the child's medical condition and best interests and whether there is reason to believe that a new health benefit plan would omit or limit benefits because of a preexisting condition.\n\n9. An abatement of a parent's child support obligation shall not automatically abate that parent's duty to provide for the child's health care needs. Unless an order of the court or the division specifically provides for abatement or termination of health care coverage, an order to maintain health benefits or otherwise provide for a child's health care needs shall continue in force until further order of the court or the division, or until the child's right to parental support terminates.\n\n(L. 1993 S.B. 253 § 4, A.L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 2019 H.B. 397)",

A court or the director of the family support division may issue an order, or in the case of a business, professional or occupational license, only a court may issue an order, suspending an obligor's license and ordering the obligor to refrain from engaging in a licensed activity in the following cases:\n\n(1) When the obligor is not making child support payments in accordance with a support order and owes an arrearage in an amount greater than or equal to three months support payments or two thousand five hundred dollars, whichever is less, as of the date of service of a notice of intent to suspend such license; or\n\n(2) When the obligor or any other person, after receiving appropriate notice, fails to comply with a subpoena of a court or the director concerning actions relating to the establishment of paternity, or to the establishment, modification or enforcement of support orders, or order of the director for genetic testing.\n\n2. In any case but a IV-D case, upon the petition of an obligee alleging the existence of an arrearage, a court with jurisdiction over the support order may issue a notice of intent to suspend a license.

To show cause why suspension of a license may not be appropriate, the obligor shall request a hearing from the court or division that issued the notice of intent to suspend the license. The request shall be made within sixty days of the date of service of notice.\n\n2. If an obligor fails to respond, without good cause, to a notice of intent to suspend a license or to timely request a hearing or comply with a payment plan, the court or director may enter an order suspending the obligor's license and ordering the obligor to refrain from engaging in the licensed activity.\n\n3. Upon timely receipt of a request for hearing from an obligor, the court or director shall schedule a hearing that complies with due process to determine if suspension of the obligor's license is appropriate considering all relevant factors, including those factors listed in subsection 4 of this section. The court or director shall stay suspension of the license pending the outcome of the hearing.\n\n4. In determining whether the license suspension is appropriate under the circumstances, the court or director shall consider and issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law within thirty days following the hearing regarding the following:\n\n(1) The identity of the obligor;\n\n(2) Whether the arrearage is in an amount greater than or equal to three months of support payments or two thousand five hundred dollars, whichever is less, by the date of service of a notice of intent to suspend;\n\n(3) Whether the obligor has entered a payment plan. If the action involves a failure to comply with a subpoena or order, the only issues that may be determined are the identity of the obligor and whether the obligor has complied with the subpoena or order;\n\n(4) Whether the obligor had the ability to make the payments that are in arrearage;\n\n(5) Whether the obligor has the current ability to make the payments;\n\n(6) The reasons the obligor needs the license, including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) Transportation of family members to and from work, school, or medical treatment;\n\n(b) Transportation of the obligor or family members to extracurricular activities; or\n\n(c) A requirement for employment;\n\n(7) Whether the obligor is unemployed or underemployed;\n\n(8) Whether the obligor is actively seeking employment;\n\n(9) Whether the obligor has engaged in job search and job readiness assistance, including utilization of the state employment database website;\n\n(10) Whether the obligor has a physical or mental impairment affecting his or her capacity to work; and\n\n(11) Any other relevant factors that affect the obligor's ability to make the child support payments.\n\n5. If the court or director, after the hearing, determines that the obligor has failed to comply with the child support payment obligation and an arrearage exists in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars for good cause, then the court or director shall not issue an order suspending the obligor's license and ordering the obligor to refrain from engaging in the licensed activity or, if an order is in place, shall stay such order. Good cause may include loss of employment, excluding voluntarily quitting or a dismissal due to poor job performance or failure to meet a condition of employment; catastrophic illness or accident of the obligor or a family member; severe inclement weather, including a natural disaster; or the obligor experiences a family emergency or other life-changing event, including divorce or domestic violence. A decision by the court or director under this section not to issue an order suspending the obligor's license and ordering the obligor to refrain from engaging in the licensed activity shall not prevent a court or the director from issuing a new order suspending the license of the same obligor in the event of another arrearage if the obligor fails, without good cause, to comply with the support order or payment plan.\n\n6. If the court or director, after hearing, determines that the obligor has failed, without good cause, to comply with any of the requirements in subsection 4 of this section, the court or director shall issue an order suspending the obligor's license and ordering the obligor to refrain from engaging in the licensed activity.\n\n7. The court or division shall send a copy of the order suspending a license to the licensing authority and the obligor by certified mail.\n\n8. The determination of the director, after a hearing pursuant to this section, shall be a final agency decision and shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536. Administrative hearings held pursuant to this section shall be conducted by hearing officers appointed by the director of the department pursuant to subsection 1 of section 454.475.\n\n9. A determination made by the court or division pursuant to this section is independent of any proceeding of the licensing authority to suspend, revoke, deny, terminate or renew a license.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 2023 S.B. 35)",

Conditions of rendition. —(a) Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to sections 454.1500 to 454.1728 or that the proceeding would be of no avail.\n\n(b) If, under sections 454.1500 to 454.1728 or a law substantially similar to sections 454.1500 to 454.1728, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.\n\n(c) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.\n\n(L. 2011 H.B. 260)\n\nEffective 6-15-16, see § 454.1728",
