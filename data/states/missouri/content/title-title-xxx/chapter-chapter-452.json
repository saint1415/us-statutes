The presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4.

Bowers (A.), 533 S.W.2d 614.\n\n(1976) For the purposes of this division of marital property under this section, the \"conduct\" of the parties during the marriage is a relevant factor to be considered by the trial court and the award to the husband of all of the real estate determined to be marital property was not error. Conrad v. Bowers (A.), 533 S.W.2d 614.\n\n(1976) Trial courts are vested with broad discretion in dividing marital property in dissolution of marriage proceedings. In re Marriage of Vanet (A.), 544 S.W.2d 236.\n\n(1976) The word \"conduct\" means general conduct of the parties during the marriage and is not limited to conduct relating to financial misdeeds. Butcher v. Butcher (A.), 544 S.W.2d 249.\n\n(1976) For discussion of division of marital property and definition of same see Davis v. Davis (A.), 544 S.W.2d 259.\n\n(1977) While wife's misconduct was to be taken into account in dividing marital property, it had begun late in the nineteen year marriage and was not such as to deprive her of right to share equitably in marital property. Thus, in addition to shares in closely held corporation awarded by trial court, she would be awarded a farm acquired by parties during marriage. Marriage of Schulte (A.), 546 S.W.2d 41.\n\n(1977) Requirement that court make a division of marital property in a dissolution action is mandatory and failure to comply results in no final judgment in the action. The fact that a final judgment has not been rendered bars an appeal under the provisions of § 512.020, RSMo. Corder v. Corder (A.), 546 S.W.2d 798.\n\n(1977) Property purchased with earnings during marriage is marital property regardless of how title is taken. Held error to set a future date for sale of property and allow a party a dollar value when sold. Inflation could seriously alter the value of the amount received so that proper judgment should have been for a percentage of the sale to be held in the future. Ortmann v. Ortmann (A.), 550 S.W.2d 226.\n\n(1977) Held, failure of either party's petition to ask for division of property does not relieve trial judge from duty to make a division of the property. Hulsey v. Hulsey, (A.), 550 S.W.2d 902.\n\n(1977) A husband may not voluntarily limit his work to reduce his income and escape support payments. A court may in proper circumstances impute an income to a husband according to what he could have earned by the use of his best efforts. Klinge v. Klinge (A.), 554 S.W.2d 474.\n\n(1978) Statute does not require equal division of marital property, but only \"just\" division. This is true where one spouse has engaged in marital misconduct. Arp v. Arp (A.),572 S.W.2d 232.\n\n(1978) Personal jurisdiction over an absent spouse is not necessary to confer jurisdiction for the purpose of dividing marital property. Chenoweth v. Chenoweth (A.), 575 S.W.2d 871.\n\n(1984) \"Source of funds\" theory, adopted in this case, requires that the court determine the character of property by the source of funds financing the purchase, so that the property is considered to have been \"acquired\" as it is paid for. This theory allows for reimbursement for increase in value of the property. Hoffman v. Hoffman (Mo. banc), 676 S.W.2d 817.\n\n(1985) Held, the \"source of funds rule\" as announced in Hoffman v. Hoffman, 676 S.W.2d 817 (Mo banc 1984) should be retrospectively applied. Sumners v. Sumners, (Mo.), 701 S.W.2d 720.\n\n(1987) Goodwill in a professional practice is property subject to division pursuant to this section and is defined as the value of the practice which exceeds its tangible assets and which is the result of the tendency of clients/patients to return to and recommend the practice irrespective of the reputation of the individual practitioner. Hanson v. Hanson, 738 S.W.2d 429 (Mo. banc.).\n\n(1987) Proper date for valuing marital property in a dissolution proceeding is the date of the trial. Taylor v. Taylor, 736 S.W.2d 388 (Mo. banc.).\n\n(1987) It was proper for the court to consider, as an economic circumstance, in making a division of property, the sums voluntarily expended by husband for the support and education of a healthy adult child and to offset the wife's entitlement to husband's retirement pay by sums she received or would have received in maintenance. In Re Marriage of Dildy, 737 S.W.2d 756 (Mo.App.S.D.).\n\n(1997) Statute does not allow the court to quash a QDRO and replace it with a domestic relations order that was not qualified. Offield v. Offield, 955 S.W.2d 247 (Mo.App.W.D.).\n\n(1999) Statute does not give a trial court discretion to divide and distribute marital property to the parties' children. Randolph v. Randolph, 8 S.W.3d 160 (Mo.App.W.D.).\n\n(2003) Section is more specific concerning authorization for modifying qualified domestic relations order and thus prevails over more general statute precluding modification of marital property division.

In a proceeding for nonretroactive invalidity, dissolution of marriage or legal separation, or a proceeding for maintenance following dissolution of the marriage by a court which lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse, the court may grant a maintenance order to either spouse, but only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance:\n\n(1) Lacks sufficient property, including marital property apportioned to him, to provide for his reasonable needs; and\n\n(2) Is unable to support himself through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it appropriate that the custodian not be required to seek employment outside the home.\n\n2. The maintenance order shall be in such amounts and for such periods of time as the court deems just, and after considering all relevant factors including:\n\n(1) The financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property apportioned to him, and his ability to meet his needs independently, including the extent to which a provision for support of a child living with the party includes a sum for that party as custodian;\n\n(2) The time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment;\n\n(3) The comparative earning capacity of each spouse;\n\n(4) The standard of living established during the marriage;\n\n(5) The obligations and assets, including the marital property apportioned to him and the separate property of each party;\n\n(6) The duration of the marriage;\n\n(7) The age, and the physical and emotional condition of the spouse seeking maintenance;\n\n(8) The ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet his needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance;\n\n(9) The conduct of the parties during the marriage; and\n\n(10) Any other relevant factors.\n\n3.

Child support, how allocated — factors to be considered — abatement or termination of support, when — support after age eighteen, when — public policy of state — payments may be made directly to child, when — child support guidelines, rebuttable presumption, use of guidelines, when — retroactivity — obligation terminated, how. —1. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal separation or child support, the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child of the marriage to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for the support of the child, including an award retroactive to the date of filing the petition, without regard to marital misconduct, after considering all relevant factors including:\n\n(1) The financial needs and resources of the child;\n\n(2) The financial resources and needs of the parents;\n\n(3) The standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not been dissolved;\n\n(4) The physical and emotional condition of the child, and the child's educational needs;\n\n(5) The child's physical and legal custody arrangements, including the amount of time the child spends with each parent and the reasonable expenses associated with the custody or visitation arrangements; and\n\n(6) The reasonable work-related child care expenses of each parent.\n\n2. The obligation of the parent ordered to make support payments shall abate, in whole or in part, for such periods of time in excess of thirty consecutive days that the other parent has voluntarily relinquished physical custody of a child to the parent ordered to pay child support, notwithstanding any periods of visitation or temporary physical and legal or physical or legal custody pursuant to a judgment of dissolution or legal separation or any modification thereof. In a IV-D case, the family support division may determine the amount of the abatement pursuant to this subsection for any child support order and shall record the amount of abatement in the automated child support system record established pursuant to chapter 454. If the case is not a IV-D case and upon court order, the circuit clerk shall record the amount of abatement in the automated child support system record established in chapter 454.\n\n3. Unless the circumstances of the child manifestly dictate otherwise and the court specifically so provides, the obligation of a parent to make child support payments shall terminate when the child:\n\n(2) Marries;\n\n(3) Enters active duty in the military;\n\n(4) Becomes self-supporting, provided that the custodial parent has relinquished the child from parental control by express or implied consent;\n\n(5) Reaches age eighteen, unless the provisions of subsection 4 or 5 of this section apply; or\n\n(6) Reaches age twenty-one, unless the provisions of the child support order specifically extend the parental support order past the child's twenty-first birthday for reasons provided by subsection 4 of this section.\n\n4. If the child is physically or mentally incapacitated from supporting himself and insolvent and unmarried, the court may extend the parental support obligation past the child's eighteenth birthday.\n\n5. If when a child reaches age eighteen, the child is enrolled in and attending a secondary school program of instruction, the parental support obligation shall continue, if the child continues to attend and progresses toward completion of said program, until the child completes such program or reaches age twenty-one, whichever first occurs. If the child is enrolled in an institution of vocational or higher education not later than October first following graduation from a secondary school or completion of a graduation equivalence degree program and so long as the child enrolls for and completes at least twelve hours of credit each semester, not including the summer semester, at an institution of vocational or higher education and achieves grades sufficient to reenroll at such institution, the parental support obligation shall continue until the child completes his or her education, or until the child reaches the age of twenty-one, whichever first occurs. To remain eligible for such continued parental support, at the beginning of each semester the child shall submit to each parent a transcript or similar official document provided by the institution of vocational or higher education which includes the courses the child is enrolled in and has completed for each term, the grades and credits received for each such course, and an official document from the institution listing the courses which the child is enrolled in for the upcoming term and the number of credits for each such course. When enrolled in at least twelve credit hours, if the child receives failing grades in half or more of his or her courseload in any one semester, payment of child support may be terminated and shall not be eligible for reinstatement. Upon request for notification of the child's grades by the noncustodial parent, the child shall produce the required documents to the noncustodial parent within thirty days of receipt of grades from the education institution. If the child fails to produce the required documents, payment of child support may terminate without the accrual of any child support arrearage and shall not be eligible for reinstatement. If the circumstances of the child manifestly dictate, the court may waive the October first deadline for enrollment required by this subsection. If the child is enrolled in such an institution, the child or parent obligated to pay support may petition the court to amend the order to direct the obligated parent to make the payments directly to the child. As used in this section, an\"institution of vocational education\"means any postsecondary training or schooling for which the student is assessed a fee and attends classes regularly.\"Higher education\"means any community college, college, or university at which the child attends classes regularly. A child who has been diagnosed with a developmental disability, as defined in section 630.005, or whose physical disability or diagnosed health problem limits the child's ability to carry the number of credit hours prescribed in this subsection, shall remain eligible for child support so long as such child is enrolled in and attending an institution of vocational or higher education, and the child continues to meet the other requirements of this subsection. A child who is employed at least fifteen hours per week during the semester may take as few as nine credit hours per semester and remain eligible for child support so long as all other requirements of this subsection are complied with.\n\n6. The court shall consider ordering a parent to waive the right to claim the tax dependency exemption for a child enrolled in an institution of vocational or higher education in favor of the other parent if the application of state and federal tax laws and eligibility for financial aid will make an award of the exemption to the other parent appropriate.\n\n7. The general assembly finds and declares that it is the public policy of this state that frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage is in the best interest of the child except for cases where the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child. In order to effectuate this public policy, a court with jurisdiction shall enforce visitation, custody and child support orders in the same manner. A court with jurisdiction may abate, in whole or in part, any past or future obligation of support and may transfer the physical and legal or physical or legal custody of one or more children if it finds that a parent has, without good cause, failed to provide visitation or physical and legal or physical or legal custody to the other parent pursuant to the terms of a judgment of dissolution, legal separation or modifications thereof. The court shall also award, if requested and for good cause shown, reasonable expenses, attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing party.\n\n8. The Missouri supreme court shall have in effect a rule establishing guidelines by which any award of child support shall be made in any judicial or administrative proceeding. Said guidelines shall contain specific, descriptive and numeric criteria which will result in a computation of the support obligation. The guidelines shall address how the amount of child support shall be calculated when an award of joint physical custody results in the child or children spending equal or substantially equal time with both parents and the directions and comments and any tabular representations of the directions and comments for completion of the child support guidelines and a subsequent form developed to reflect the guidelines shall reflect the ability to obtain up to a fifty percent adjustment or credit below the basic child support amount for joint physical custody or visitation as described in subsection 11 of this section. The Missouri supreme court shall publish child support guidelines and specifically list and explain the relevant factors and assumptions that were used to calculate the child support guidelines. Any rule made pursuant to this subsection shall be reviewed by the promulgating body not less than once every four years to ensure that its application results in the determination of appropriate child support award amounts.\n\n9. There shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines established pursuant to subsection 8 of this section is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. A written finding or specific finding on the record in a judicial or administrative proceeding that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, after considering all relevant factors, including the factors set out in subsection 1 of this section, shall be required and shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in the case. The written finding or specific finding on the record shall detail the specific relevant factors that required a deviation from the application of the guidelines.\n\n10. Pursuant to this or any other chapter, when a court determines the amount owed by a parent for support provided to a child by another person, other than a parent, prior to the date of filing of a petition requesting support, or when the director of the family support division establishes the amount of state debt due pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 454.465, the court or director shall use the guidelines established pursuant to subsection 8 of this section. The amount of child support resulting from the application of the guidelines shall be applied retroactively for a period prior to the establishment of a support order and the length of the period of retroactivity shall be left to the discretion of the court or director. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount resulting from application of the guidelines under subsection 8 of this section constitutes the amount owed by the parent for the period prior to the date of the filing of the petition for support or the period for which state debt is being established. In applying the guidelines to determine a retroactive support amount, when information as to average monthly income is available, the court or director may use the average monthly income of the noncustodial parent, as averaged over the period of retroactivity, in determining the amount of presumed child support owed for the period of retroactivity. The court or director may enter a different amount in a particular case upon finding, after consideration of all relevant factors, including the factors set out in subsection 1 of this section, that there is sufficient cause to rebut the presumed amount.\n\n11. The court may award child support in an amount that provides up to a fifty percent adjustment below the basic child support amount authorized by the child support guidelines described under subsection 8 of this section for custody awards of joint physical custody where the child or children spend equal or substantially equal time with both parents.\n\n12. The obligation of a parent to make child support payments may be terminated as follows:\n\n(1) Provided that the state case registry or child support order contains the child's date of birth, the obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or administrative process when the child reaches age twenty-one if the child support order does not specifically require payment of child support beyond age twenty-one for reasons provided by subsection 4 of this section;\n\n(2) The obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or administrative process when the parent receiving child support furnishes a sworn statement or affidavit notifying the obligor parent of the child's emancipation in accordance with the requirements of subsection 4 of section 452.370, and a copy of such sworn statement or affidavit is filed with the court which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or the family support division for an order entered under section 454.470;\n\n(3) The obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or administrative process when the parent paying child support files a sworn statement or affidavit with the court which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or the family support division for an order entered under section 454.470, stating that the child is emancipated and reciting the factual basis for such statement; which statement or affidavit is served by the court or division, as applicable, on the child support obligee; and which is either acknowledged and affirmed by the child support obligee in writing, or which is not responded to in writing within thirty days of receipt by the child support obligee;\n\n(4) The obligation shall be terminated as provided by this subdivision by the court which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or the family support division for an order entered under section 454.470, when the parent paying child support files a sworn statement or affidavit with the court which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or the family support division, as applicable, stating that the child is emancipated and reciting the factual basis for such statement; and which statement or affidavit is served by the court or division, as applicable, on the child support obligee. If the obligee denies the statement or affidavit, the court or division shall thereupon treat the sworn statement or affidavit as a request for hearing and shall proceed to hear and adjudicate such request for hearing as provided by law; provided that the court may require the payment of a deposit as security for court costs and any accrued court costs, as provided by law, in relation to such request for hearing. When the division receives a request for hearing, the hearing shall be held in the manner provided by section 454.475.\n\n13. The court may enter a judgment terminating child support pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (3) of subsection 12 of this section without necessity of a court appearance by either party. The clerk of the court shall mail a copy of a judgment terminating child support entered pursuant to subsection 12 of this section on both the obligor and obligee parents. The supreme court may promulgate uniform forms for sworn statements and affidavits to terminate orders of child support obligations for use pursuant to subsection 12 of this section and subsection 4 of section 452.370.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 9, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1272, et al., A.L. 1989 1st Ex.

Rolla Women's Clinic, Inc., 866 S.W.2d 851 (Mo en banc).\n\n(1994) Cadet at West Point was considered emancipated for purposes of child support even though academy provided education. Cadet's life at West Point is largely controlled by the government, which also provides for the bulk of the cadet's material needs. Federal law establishes that a cadet is part of the regular Army.

Maintenance or support payments to circuit clerk or family support payment center, when — procedure — duties of parties — failure to pay, circuit clerk duties. —1. As used in sections 452.345 to 452.350, the term\"IV-D case\"shall mean a case in which support rights have been assigned to the state of Missouri or where the family support division is providing support enforcement services pursuant to section 454.400.\n\n2. At any time the court, upon its own motion, may, or upon the motion of either party shall, order that maintenance or support payments be made to the circuit clerk as trustee for remittance to the person entitled to receive the payments. The circuit clerk shall remit such support payments to the person entitled to receive the payments within three working days of receipt by the circuit clerk. Circuit clerks shall deposit all receipts no later than the next working day after receipt. Payment by a nonguaranteed negotiable financial instrument occurs when the instrument has cleared the depository institution and has been credited to the trust account. Effective October 1, 1999, at any time the court may upon its own motion, or shall upon the motion of either party, order that support payments as required by section 454.530 be made to the family support payment center established in section 454.530 as trustee for remittance to the person entitled to receive the payments. However, in no case shall the court order payments to be made to the payment center if the family support division notifies the court that such payments shall not be made to the center. In such cases, payments shall be made to the clerk as trustee until the division notifies the court that payments shall be directed to the payment center. Further, with the agreement of the division, the court may order payments to be made to the payment center prior to October 1, 1999.\n\n3. The circuit clerk shall maintain records in the automated child support system which list the amount of payments, the date when payments are required to be made, and the names and addresses of the parties affected by the order. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the family support division from entering information in the records of the automated child support system, as provided for in chapter 454.\n\n4.

For any case in which an order for support or maintenance was entered prior to January 1, 1994, which has not been modified subsequent to that date, except a IV-D case, if a party becomes delinquent in maintenance or support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation, the provisions of this subsection shall apply. If the circuit clerk has been appointed trustee under subsection 2 of this section, or if the person entitled to receive the payments files with the clerk an affidavit stating the particulars of the obligor's noncompliance, the circuit clerk shall send by regular mail notice of the delinquency to the obligor. This notice shall advise the obligor of the delinquency, shall state the amount of the obligation, and shall advise that the obligor's income is subject to withholding for repayment of the delinquency and for payment of current support, as provided in section 452.350. For such cases, the circuit clerk shall, in addition to the notice to the obligor, send by regular mail a notice to the obligee. This notice shall state the amount of the delinquency and shall advise the obligee that income withholding, pursuant to section 452.350, is available for collection of support delinquencies and current support, and if the support order includes amounts for child support, that support enforcement services, pursuant to section 454.425, are available through the Missouri family support division of the department of social services.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 10, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1990 S.B. 834, A.L. 1996 S.B. 869, A.L. 1997 S.B. 248 merged with S.B. 361, A.L. 1999 S.B. 291, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)\n\n(1976) Proceeding to cite defendant for contempt for failure to pay court ordered support and maintenance for plaintiff and their minor children classified as civil contempt and subject to review on appeal.

Withholding of income, voluntary or court may order, when, when effective — hearing, when — employer, duties, liabilities, fee — discharge or discipline of employee because of a withholding notice prohibited, penalty — civil contempt proceeding authorized — amendment, termination and priorities of withholdings. —1. Until January 1, 1994, except for orders entered or modified in IV-D cases, each order for child support or maintenance entered or modified by the court pursuant to the authority of this chapter, or otherwise, shall include a provision notifying the person obligated to pay such support or maintenance that, upon application by the obligee or the Missouri family support division of the department of social services, the obligor's wages or other income shall be subject to withholding without further notice if the obligor becomes delinquent in maintenance or child support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation. The order shall also contain provisions notifying the obligor that:\n\n(1) The withholding shall be for the current month's maintenance and support; and\n\n(2) The withholding shall include an additional amount equal to fifty percent of one month's child support and maintenance to defray delinquent child support and maintenance, which additional withholding shall continue until the delinquency is paid in full.\n\n2. For all orders entered or modified in IV-D cases, and effective January 1, 1994, for every order for child support or maintenance entered or modified by the court pursuant to the authority of this chapter, or otherwise, income withholding pursuant to this section shall be initiated on the effective date of the order, except that such withholding shall not commence with the effective date of the order in any case where:\n\n(1) One of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding. For purposes of this subdivision, any finding that there is good cause not to require immediate withholding must be based on, at least, a written determination and an explanation by the court that implementing immediate wage withholding would not be in the best interests of the child and proof of timely payments of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of support orders; or\n\n(2) A written agreement is reached between the parties that provides for an alternative arrangement.­­If the income of an obligor is not withheld as of the effective date of the support order, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, or otherwise, such obligor's income shall become subject to withholding pursuant to this section without further exception on the date on which the obligor becomes delinquent in maintenance or child support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation. Such withholding shall be initiated in the manner provided in subsection 4 of this section. All IV-D orders entered or modified by the court shall contain a provision notifying the obligor that he or she shall notify the family support division regarding the availability of medical insurance coverage through an employer or a group plan, provide the name of the insurance provider when coverage is available, and inform the division of any change in access to such insurance coverage. Any income withheld pursuant to this section for a support order initially entered on or after October 1, 1999, shall be paid to the payment center pursuant to section 454.530. Any order of the court entered on or after October 1, 1999, establishing the withholding for a support order as defined in section 454.460, or notice from the clerk issued on or after October 1, 1999, pursuant to this section for a support order shall require payment to the payment center pursuant to section 454.530.\n\n­­If the income of an obligor is not withheld as of the effective date of the support order, pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, or otherwise, such obligor's income shall become subject to withholding pursuant to this section without further exception on the date on which the obligor becomes delinquent in maintenance or child support payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation. Such withholding shall be initiated in the manner provided in subsection 4 of this section. All IV-D orders entered or modified by the court shall contain a provision notifying the obligor that he or she shall notify the family support division regarding the availability of medical insurance coverage through an employer or a group plan, provide the name of the insurance provider when coverage is available, and inform the division of any change in access to such insurance coverage. Any income withheld pursuant to this section for a support order initially entered on or after October 1, 1999, shall be paid to the payment center pursuant to section 454.530. Any order of the court entered on or after October 1, 1999, establishing the withholding for a support order as defined in section 454.460, or notice from the clerk issued on or after October 1, 1999, pursuant to this section for a support order shall require payment to the payment center pursuant to section 454.530.\n\n3. The provisions of section 432.030 to the contrary notwithstanding, if income withholding has not been initiated on the effective date of the initial or modified order, the obligated party may execute a voluntary income assignment at any time, which assignment shall be filed with the court and shall take effect after service on the employer or other payer.\n\n4. The circuit clerk, upon application of the obligee or the family support division, shall send, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written notice to the employer or other payer listed on the application when the obligated party is subject to withholding pursuant to the child support order or subsection 2 of this section. For orders entered or modified in cases known by the circuit clerk to be IV-D cases in which income withholding is to be initiated on the effective date of the order, and effective January 1, 1994, for all orders entered or modified by the court in which income withholding is to be initiated on the effective date of the order, the circuit clerk shall send such notice to the employer or other payer in the manner provided by this section at the time the order is entered without application of any party when an employer or other payer is identified to the circuit clerk by inclusion in the pleadings pursuant to section 452.312, or otherwise. The notice of income withholding shall be prepared by the person entitled to support pursuant to the order, or the legal representative of that person, on a form prescribed by the court, and shall be presented to the clerk of the court at the time the order of support is entered. The notice shall direct the employer or other payer to withhold each month an amount equal to one month's child support and maintenance until further notice from the court. In the event of a delinquency in child support or maintenance payments in an amount equal to one month's total support obligation, the notice further shall direct the employer or other payer to withhold each month an additional amount equal to fifty percent of one month's child support and maintenance until the support delinquency is paid in full. The notice shall also include a statement of exemptions which may apply to limit the portion of the obligated party's disposable earnings which are subject to the withholding pursuant to federal or state law and notify the obligor that the obligor may request a hearing and related information pursuant to this section. The notice shall contain the Social Security number of the obligor if available. The circuit clerk shall send a copy of this notice by regular mail to the last known address of the obligated party. A notice issued pursuant to this section shall be binding on the employer or other payer, and successor employers and payers, two weeks after mailing, and shall continue until further order of the court or the family support division. If the notice does not contain the Social Security number of the obligor, the employer or other payer shall not be liable for withholding from the incorrect obligor. The obligated party may, within that two-week period, request a hearing on the issue of whether the withholding should take effect. The withholding shall not be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the hearing. The obligor may not obtain relief from the withholding by paying overdue support, if any. The only basis for contesting the withholding is a mistake of fact. For the purpose of this section,\"mistake of fact\"shall mean an error in the amount of arrearages, if applicable, or an error as to the identity of the obligor. The court shall hold its hearing, enter its order disposing of all issues disputed by the obligated party, and notify the obligated party and the employer or other payer, within forty-five days of the date on which the withholding notice was sent to the employer.\n\n5. For each payment the employer may charge a fee not to exceed six dollars per month, which shall be deducted from each obligor's moneys, income or periodic earnings, in addition to the amount deducted to meet the support or maintenance obligation subject to the limitations contained in the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1673).\n\n6. Upon termination of the obligor's employment with an employer upon whom a withholding notice has been served, the employer shall so notify the court in writing. The employer shall also inform the court, in writing, as to the last known address of the obligor and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known.\n\n7. Amounts withheld by the employer or other payer shall be transmitted, in accordance with the notice, within seven business days of the date that such amounts were payable to the obligated party. For purposes of this section,\"business day\"means a day that state offices are open for regular business. The employer or other payer shall, along with the amounts transmitted, provide the date each amount was withheld from each obligor. If the employer or other payer is withholding amounts for more than one order, the employer or other payer may combine all such withholdings that are payable to the same circuit clerk or the family support payment center and transmit them as one payment, together with a separate list identifying the cases to which they apply. The cases shall be identified by court case number, name of obligor, the obligor's Social Security number, the IV-D case number, if any, the amount withheld for each obligor, and the withholding date or dates for each obligor, to the extent that such information is known to the employer or other payer. An employer or other payer who fails to honor a withholding notice pursuant to this section may be held in contempt of court and is liable to the obligee for the amount that should have been withheld. Compliance by an employer or other payer with the withholding notice operates as a discharge of liability to the obligor as to that portion of the obligor's periodic earnings or other income so affected.\n\n8. As used in this section, the term\"employer\"includes the state and its political subdivisions.\n\n9. An employer shall not discharge or otherwise discipline, or refuse to hire, an employee as a result of a withholding notice issued pursuant to this section. Any obligor who is aggrieved as a result of a violation of this subsection may bring a civil contempt proceeding against the employer by filing an appropriate motion in the cause of action from which the withholding notice issued. If the court finds that the employer discharged, disciplined, or refused to hire the obligor as a result of the withholding notice, the court may order the employer to reinstate or hire the obligor, or rescind any wrongful disciplinary action. If, after the entry of such an order, the employer refuses without good cause to comply with the court's order, or if the employer fails to comply with the withholding notice, the court may, after notice to the employer and a hearing, impose a fine against the employer, not to exceed five hundred dollars. Proceeds of any such fine shall be distributed by the court to the county general revenue fund.\n\n10. A withholding entered pursuant to this section may, upon motion of a party and for good cause shown, be amended by the court. The clerk shall notify the employer of the amendment in the manner provided for in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n11. The court, upon the motion of obligor and for good cause shown, may terminate the withholding, except that the withholding shall not be terminated for the sole reason that the obligor has fully paid past due child support and maintenance.\n\n12. A withholding effected pursuant to this section shall have priority over any other legal process pursuant to state law against the same wages, except that where the other legal process is an order issued pursuant to this section or section 454.505, the processes shall run concurrently, up to applicable wage withholding limitations. If concurrently running wage withholding processes for the collection of support obligations would cause the amounts withheld from the wages of the obligor to exceed applicable wage withholding limitations and includes a wage withholding from another state pursuant to section 454.932, the employer shall first satisfy current support obligations by dividing the amount available to be withheld among the orders on a pro rata basis using the percentages derived from the relationship each current support order amount has to the sum of all current child support obligations. Thereafter, delinquencies shall be satisfied using the same pro rata distribution procedure used for distributing current support, up to the applicable limitation. If concurrently running wage withholding processes for the collection of support obligations would cause the amounts withheld from the wages of the obligor to exceed applicable wage withholding limitations and does not include a wage withholding from another state pursuant to section 454.932, the employer shall withhold and pay to the payment center an amount equal to the wage withholding limitations. The payment center shall first satisfy current support obligations by dividing the amount available to be withheld among the orders on a pro rata basis using the percentages derived from the relationship each current support order amount has to the sum of all current child support obligations. Thereafter, arrearages shall be satisfied using the same pro rata distribution procedure used for distributing current support, up to the applicable limitation.\n\n13. The remedy provided by this section applies to child support and maintenance orders entered prior to August 13, 1986, notwithstanding the absence of the notice to the obligor provided for in subsection 1 of this section, provided that prior notice from the circuit clerk to the obligor in the manner prescribed in subsection 5 of section 452.345 is given.\n\n14. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, in a case in which support rights have been assigned to the state or in which the family support division is providing support enforcement services pursuant to section 454.425, the director of the family support division may amend or terminate a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, as provided in this subsection without further action of the court. The director may amend or terminate a withholding order and issue an administrative withholding order pursuant to section 454.505 when the director determines that children for whom the support order applies are no longer entitled to support pursuant to section 452.340, when the support obligation otherwise ends and all arrearages are paid, when the support obligation is modified pursuant to section 454.500, or when the director enters an order that is approved by the court pursuant to section 454.496. The director shall notify the employer and the circuit clerk of such amendment or termination. The director's administrative withholding order or withholding termination order shall preempt and supersede any previous judicial withholding order issued pursuant to this or any other section.\n\n15. For the purpose of this section,\"income\"means any periodic form of payment due to an individual, regardless of source, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, workers' compensation benefits, disability benefits, payments pursuant to a pension or a retirement program and interest.\n\n16. If the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services promulgates a final standard format for an employer income withholding notice, the court shall use or require the use of such notice.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 11, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1275, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1987 H.B. 484, A.L. 1990 S.B. 834, A.L. 1993 S.B. 253, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1491 & 1134, A.L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 1999 S.B. 291, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)\n\n(1980) Statute providing specifically for assignment of future wages upon order of court for purposes of enforcing order for maintenance created an exception to § 432.030 prohibiting the assignment of future wages.

Unless otherwise indicated, the court from time to time after considering all relevant factors including the financial resources of both parties, the merits of the case and the actions of the parties during the pendency of the action, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding pursuant to sections 452.300 to 452.415 and for attorney's fees, including sums for legal services rendered and costs incurred prior to the commencement of the proceeding and after entry of a final judgment.

Modification of judgment as to maintenance or support, when — termination, when — rights of state when an assignment of support has been made — court to have continuing jurisdiction, duties of clerk, clerk to be \"appropriate agent\", when — severance of responsive pleading. —1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6 of section 452.325, the provisions of any judgment respecting maintenance or support may be modified only upon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unreasonable. In a proceeding for modification of any child support or maintenance judgment, the court, in determining whether or not a substantial change in circumstances has occurred, shall consider all financial resources of both parties, including the extent to which the reasonable expenses of either party are, or should be, shared by a spouse or other person with whom he or she cohabits, and the earning capacity of a party who is not employed. If the application of the child support guidelines and criteria set forth in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules to the financial circumstances of the parties would result in a change of child support from the existing amount by twenty percent or more, a prima facie showing has been made of a change of circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the present terms unreasonable, if the existing amount was based upon the presumed amount pursuant to the child support guidelines.\n\n2. When the party seeking modification has met the burden of proof set forth in subsection 1 of this section, the child support shall be determined in conformity with criteria set forth in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules.\n\n3. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the judgment, the obligation to pay future statutory maintenance is terminated upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance.\n\n4. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the judgment, provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child. The parent entitled to receive child support shall have the duty to notify the parent obligated to pay support of the child's emancipation and failing to do so, the parent entitled to receive child support shall be liable to the parent obligated to pay support for child support paid following emancipation of a minor child, plus interest.\n\n5. If a parent has made an assignment of support rights to the family support division on behalf of the state as a condition of eligibility for benefits pursuant to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and either party initiates a motion to modify the support obligation by reducing it, the state of Missouri shall be named as a party to the proceeding. The state shall be served with a copy of the motion by sending it by certified mail to the director of the family support division.\n\n6. The court shall have continuing personal jurisdiction over both the obligee and the obligor of a court order for child support or maintenance for the purpose of modifying such order. Both obligee and obligor shall notify, in writing, the clerk of the court in which the support or maintenance order was entered of any change of mailing address. If personal service of the motion cannot be had in this state, the motion to modify and notice of hearing shall be served outside the state as provided by supreme court rule 54.14. The order may be modified only as to support or maintenance installments which accrued subsequent to the date of personal service. For the purpose of 42 U.S.C. Section 666(a)(9)(C), the circuit clerk shall be considered the appropriate agent to receive notice of the motion to modify for the obligee or the obligor, but only in those instances in which personal service could not be had in this state.\n\n7. If a responsive pleading raising the issues of custody or visitation is filed in response to a motion to modify child support filed at the request of the family support division by a prosecuting attorney or circuit attorney or an attorney under contract with the division, such responsive pleading shall be severed upon request.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any provision of this section which requires a showing of substantial and continuing change in circumstances, in a IV-D case filed pursuant to this section by the family support division as provided in section 454.400, the court shall modify a support order in accordance with the guidelines and criteria set forth in supreme court rule 88.01 and any regulations thereunder if the amount in the current order differs from the amount which would be ordered in accordance with such guidelines or regulations.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 15, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1987 H.B. 484, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1272, et al., A.L. 1990 S.B. 834, A.L. 1993 S.B. 253, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1491 & 1134, A.L. 1997 S.B. 361, A.L. 1998 S.B. 910, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)\n\nCROSS REFERENCES:\n\nCourt may abate past or future support obligation if custodial parent, without good cause, fails to honor visitation order, 452.340\n\nEmancipation of child, factors determining, 452.340\n\n(1976) Evidence that former husband had suffered, at most, eight percent reduction in pay since time of divorce, that he had been on strike for six weeks, and that he had suffered loss of income as result of medical and dental care held insufficient to show changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make terms of alimony decree unreasonable.

As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:\n\n(1)\"Custody\"means joint legal custody, sole legal custody, joint physical custody or sole physical custody or any combination thereof;\n\n(2)\"Joint legal custody\"means that the parents share the decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority relating to the health, education and welfare of the child, and, unless allocated, apportioned, or decreed, the parents shall confer with one another in the exercise of decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority;\n\n(3)\"Joint physical custody\"means an order awarding each of the parents significant, but not necessarily equal, periods of time during which a child resides with or is under the care and supervision of each of the parents. Joint physical custody shall be shared by the parents in such a way as to assure the child of frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents;\n\n(4)\"Third-party custody\"means a third party designated as a legal and physical custodian pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section.\n\n2. The court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of equal or approximately equal parenting time to each parent is in the best interests of the child. Such presumption is rebuttable only by a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the factors contained in subdivisions (1) to (8) of this subsection. The presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that the parents have reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, or if the court finds that a pattern of domestic violence has occurred as set out in subdivision (6) of this subsection. When the parties have not reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, the court shall consider all relevant factors and enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The wishes of the child's parents as to custody and the proposed parenting plan submitted by both parties;\n\n(2) The needs of the child for a frequent, continuing and meaningful relationship with both parents and the ability and willingness of parents to actively perform their functions as mother and father for the needs of the child;\n\n(3) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests;\n\n(4) Which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with the other parent;\n\n(5) The child's adjustment to the child's home, school, and community. The fact that a parent sends his or her child or children to a home school or FPE school shall not be the sole factor that a court considers in determining custody of such child or children;\n\n(6) The mental and physical health of all individuals involved, including any history of abuse of any individuals involved. If the court finds that a pattern of domestic violence as defined in section 455.010 has occurred, and, if the court also finds that awarding custody to the abusive parent is in the best interest of the child, then the court shall enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Custody and visitation rights shall be ordered in a manner that best protects the child and any other child or children for whom the parent has custodial or visitation rights, and the parent or other family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence from any further harm;\n\n(7) The intention of either parent to relocate the principal residence of the child; and\n\n(8) The unobstructed input of a child, free of coercion and manipulation, as to the child's custodial arrangement.\n\n3. (1) In any court proceedings relating to custody of a child, the court shall not award custody or unsupervised visitation of a child to a parent if such parent or any person residing with such parent has been found guilty of, or pled guilty to, any of the following offenses when a child was the victim:\n\n(a) A felony violation of section 566.030, 566.031, 566.032, 566.060, 566.061, 566.062, 566.064, 566.067, 566.068, 566.083, 566.100, 566.101, 566.111, 566.151, 566.203, 566.206, 566.209, 566.211, or 566.215;\n\n(b) A violation of section 568.020;\n\n(c) A violation of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 568.060;\n\n(d) A violation of section 568.065;\n\n(e) A violation of section 573.200;\n\n(f) A violation of section 573.205; or\n\n(g) A violation of section 568.175.\n\n(2) For all other violations of offenses in chapters 566 and 568 not specifically listed in subdivision (1) of this subsection or for a violation of an offense committed in another state when a child is the victim that would be a violation of chapter 566 or 568 if committed in Missouri, the court may exercise its discretion in awarding custody or visitation of a child to a parent if such parent or any person residing with such parent has been found guilty of, or pled guilty to, any such offense.\n\n4. The general assembly finds and declares that it is the public policy of this state that frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage is in the best interest of the child, except for cases where the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child, and that it is the public policy of this state to encourage parents to participate in decisions affecting the health, education and welfare of their children, and to resolve disputes involving their children amicably through alternative dispute resolution. In order to effectuate these policies, the general assembly encourages the court to enter a temporary parenting plan as early as practicable in a proceeding under this chapter, consistent with the provisions of subsection 2 of this section, and, in so doing, the court shall determine the custody arrangement which will best assure both parents participate in such decisions and have frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with their children so long as it is in the best interests of the child.\n\n5. Prior to awarding the appropriate custody arrangement in the best interest of the child, the court shall consider each of the following as follows:\n\n(1) Joint physical and joint legal custody to both parents, which shall not be denied solely for the reason that one parent opposes a joint physical and joint legal custody award. The residence of one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing and educational purposes;\n\n(2) Joint physical custody with one party granted sole legal custody. The residence of one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing and educational purposes;\n\n(3) Joint legal custody with one party granted sole physical custody;\n\n(4) Sole custody to either parent; or\n\n(5) Third-party custody or visitation:\n\n(a) When the court finds that each parent is unfit, unsuitable, or unable to be a custodian, or the welfare of the child requires, and it is in the best interests of the child, then custody, temporary custody or visitation may be awarded to a person related by consanguinity or affinity to the child. If no person related to the child by consanguinity or affinity is willing to accept custody, then the court may award custody to any other person or persons deemed by the court to be suitable and able to provide an adequate and stable environment for the child. Before the court awards custody, temporary custody or visitation to a third person under this subdivision, the court shall make that person a party to the action;\n\n(b) Under the provisions of this subsection, any person may petition the court to intervene as a party in interest at any time as provided by supreme court rule.\n\n6. If the parties have not agreed to a custodial arrangement, or the court determines such arrangement is not in the best interest of the child, the court shall include a written finding in the judgment or order based on the public policy in subsection 4 of this section and each of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (8) of subsection 2 of this section detailing the specific relevant factors that made a particular arrangement in the best interest of the child. If a proposed custodial arrangement is rejected by the court, the court shall include a written finding in the judgment or order detailing the specific relevant factors resulting in the rejection of such arrangement.\n\n7. Upon a finding by the court that either parent has refused to exchange information with the other parent, which shall include but not be limited to information concerning the health, education and welfare of the child, the court shall order the parent to comply immediately and to pay the prevailing party a sum equal to the prevailing party's cost associated with obtaining the requested information, which shall include but not be limited to reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.\n\n8. As between the parents of a child, no preference may be given to either parent in the awarding of custody because of that parent's age, sex, or financial status, nor because of the age or sex of the child. The court shall not presume that a parent, solely because of his or her sex, is more qualified than the other parent to act as a joint or sole legal or physical custodian for the child.\n\n9. Any judgment providing for custody shall include a specific written parenting plan setting forth the terms of such parenting plan arrangements specified in subsection 8 of section 452.310. Such plan may be a parenting plan submitted by the parties pursuant to section 452.310 or, in the absence thereof, a plan determined by the court, but in all cases, the custody plan approved and ordered by the court shall be in the court's discretion and shall be in the best interest of the child.\n\n10. After August 28, 2016, every court order establishing or modifying custody or visitation shall include the following language: \"In the event of noncompliance with this order, the aggrieved party may file a verified motion for contempt. If custody, visitation, or third-party custody is denied or interfered with by a parent or third party without good cause, the aggrieved person may file a family access motion with the court stating the specific facts that constitute a violation of the custody provisions of the judgment of dissolution, legal separation, or judgment of paternity. The circuit clerk will provide the aggrieved party with an explanation of the procedures for filing a family access motion and a simple form for use in filing the family access motion. A family access motion does not require the assistance of legal counsel to prepare and file.\".\n\n11. No court shall adopt any local rule, form, or practice requiring a standardized or default parenting plan for interim, temporary, or permanent orders or judgments. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a court may enter an interim order in a proceeding under this chapter, provided that the interim order shall not contain any provisions about child custody or a parenting schedule or plan without first providing the parties with notice and a hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree.\n\n12. Unless a parent has been denied custody rights pursuant to this section or visitation rights under section 452.400, both parents shall have access to records and information pertaining to a minor child including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and school records. If the parent without custody has been granted restricted or supervised visitation because the court has found that the parent with custody or any child has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 455.010, by the parent without custody, the court may order that the reports and records made available pursuant to this subsection not include the address of the parent with custody or the child. A court shall order that the reports and records made available under this subsection not include the address of the parent with custody if the parent with custody is a participant in the address confidentiality program under section 589.663. Unless a parent has been denied custody rights pursuant to this section or visitation rights under section 452.400, any judgment of dissolution or other applicable court order shall specifically allow both parents access to such records and reports.\n\n13. Except as otherwise precluded by state or federal law, if any individual, professional, public or private institution or organization denies access or fails to provide or disclose any and all records and information, including, but not limited to, past and present dental, medical and school records pertaining to a minor child, to either parent upon the written request of such parent, the court shall, upon its finding that the individual, professional, public or private institution or organization denied such request without good cause, order that party to comply immediately with such request and to pay to the prevailing party all costs incurred, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and court costs associated with obtaining the requested information.\n\n14. An award of joint custody does not preclude an award of child support pursuant to section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules. The court shall consider the factors contained in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules in determining an amount reasonable or necessary for the support of the child.\n\n15. If the court finds that domestic violence or abuse as defined in section 455.010 has occurred, the court shall make specific findings of fact to show that the custody or visitation arrangement ordered by the court best protects the child and the parent or other family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 455.010, and any other children for whom such parent has custodial or visitation rights from any further harm.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 16, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468, A.L. 1983 S.B. 94, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1513 subsecs. 1 to 5, 7, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1479, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1272, et al., A.L. 1989 H.B. 422, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1370, et al., A.L. 1993 S.B. 180, A.L. 1995 S.B. 174, A.L. 1998 S.B. 910, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1453, A.L. 2005 H.B. 568, A.L. 2011 S.B. 320, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1550, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1461, A.L. 2021 H.B. 429, A.L. 2023 S.B. 35, A.L. 2024 S.B. 727)\n\n(1985) Held that this section does not require agreement between the parties as a prerequisite of joint custody.

Relocation of child by parent for more than ninety days, required procedure — violation, effect — notice of relocation of parent, required procedure. —1. For purposes of this section and section 452.375,\"relocate\"or\"relocation\"means a change in the principal residence of a child for a period of ninety days or more, but does not include a temporary absence from the principal residence.\n\n2. Notice of a proposed relocation of the residence of the child, or any party entitled to custody or visitation of the child, shall be given in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to any party with custody or visitation rights. Absent exigent circumstances as determined by a court with jurisdiction, written notice shall be provided at least sixty days in advance of the proposed relocation. The notice of the proposed relocation shall include the following information:\n\n(1) The intended new residence, including the specific address and mailing address, if known, and if not known, the city;\n\n(2) The home telephone number of the new residence, if known;\n\n(3) The date of the intended move or proposed relocation;\n\n(4) A brief statement of the specific reasons for the proposed relocation of a child, if applicable;\n\n(5) A proposal for a revised schedule of custody or visitation with the child, if applicable; and\n\n(6) The other party's right, if that party is a parent, to file a motion, pursuant to this section, seeking an order to prevent the relocation and an accompanying affidavit setting forth the specific good-faith factual basis for opposing the relocation within thirty days of receipt of the notice.\n\n3. If a party seeking to relocate a child is a participant in the address confidentiality program under section 589.663, such party shall not be required to provide the information in subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of this section, but may be required to submit such information under seal to the court for in camera review. Prior to disclosure of this information, a court shall comply with the provisions of section 589.664.\n\n4. A party required to give notice of a proposed relocation pursuant to subsection 2 of this section has a continuing duty to provide a change in or addition to the information required by this section as soon as such information becomes known.\n\n5. In exceptional circumstances where the court makes a finding that the health or safety of any adult or child would be unreasonably placed at risk by the disclosure of the required identifying information concerning a proposed relocation of the child, the court may order that:\n\n(1) The specific residence address and telephone number of the child, parent or person, and other identifying information shall not be disclosed in the pleadings, notice, other documents filed in the proceeding or the final order except for an in camera disclosure;\n\n(2) The notice requirements provided by this section shall be waived to the extent necessary to protect the health or safety of a child or any adult; or\n\n(3) Any other remedial action the court considers necessary to facilitate the legitimate needs of the parties and the best interest of the child.\n\n6. The court shall consider a failure to provide notice of a proposed relocation of a child as:\n\n(1) A factor in determining whether custody and visitation should be modified;\n\n(2) A basis for ordering the return of the child if the relocation occurs without notice; and\n\n(3) Sufficient cause to order the party seeking to relocate the child to pay reasonable expenses and attorneys fees incurred by the party objecting to the relocation.\n\n7. If the parties agree to a revised schedule of custody and visitation for the child, which includes a parenting plan, they may submit the terms of such agreement to the court with a written affidavit signed by all parties with custody or visitation assenting to the terms of the agreement, and the court may order the revised parenting plan and applicable visitation schedule without a hearing.\n\n8. The residence of the child may be relocated sixty days after providing notice, as required by this section, unless a parent files a motion seeking an order to prevent the relocation within thirty days after receipt of such notice. Such motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the specific good-faith factual basis supporting a prohibition of the relocation. The person seeking relocation shall file a response to the motion within fourteen days, unless extended by the court for good cause, and include a counter-affidavit setting forth the facts in support of the relocation as well as a proposed revised parenting plan for the child.\n\n9. If relocation of the child is proposed, a third party entitled by court order to legal custody of or visitation with a child and who is not a parent may file a cause of action to obtain a revised schedule of legal custody or visitation, but shall not prevent a relocation.\n\n10. The party seeking to relocate shall have the burden of proving that the proposed relocation is made in good faith and is in the best interest of the child.\n\n11. If relocation is permitted:\n\n(1) The court shall order contact with the nonrelocating party including custody or visitation and telephone access sufficient to assure that the child has frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with the nonrelocating party unless the child's best interest warrants otherwise; and\n\n(2) The court shall specify how the transportation costs will be allocated between the parties and adjust the child support, as appropriate, considering the costs of transportation.\n\n12. After August 28, 1998, every court order establishing or modifying custody or visitation shall include the following language:\n\n13. A participant in the address confidentiality program under section 589.663 shall not be required to provide a requesting party with the specific physical or mailing address of the child's proposed relocation destination, but in the event of an objection by a requesting party, a participant may be required to submit such information under seal to the court for in camera review. Prior to disclosure of this information, a court shall comply with the provisions of section 589.664.\n\n14. Violation of the provisions of this section or a court order under this section may be deemed a change of circumstance under section 452.410, allowing the court to modify the prior custody decree. In addition, the court may utilize any and all powers relating to contempt conferred on it by law or rule of the Missouri supreme court.\n\n15. Any party who objects in good faith to the relocation of a child's principal residence shall not be ordered to pay the costs and attorney's fees of the party seeking to relocate.\n\n(L. 1984 H.B. 1513 § 452.375 subsec. 6, A.L. 1998 S.B. 910, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1461, A.L. 2019 H.B. 397 merged with S.B 83)",

(1) A parent not granted custody of the child is entitled to reasonable visitation rights unless the court finds, after a hearing, that visitation would endanger the child's physical health or impair his or her emotional development. The court shall enter an order specifically detailing the visitation rights of the parent without physical custody rights to the child and any other children for whom such parent has custodial or visitation rights. In determining the granting of visitation rights, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence. If the court finds that domestic violence has occurred, the court may find that granting visitation to the abusive party is in the best interests of the child.\n\n(2) (a) The court shall not grant visitation to the parent not granted custody if such parent or any person residing with such parent has been found guilty of or pled guilty to any of the following offenses when a child was the victim:\n\na. A felony violation of section 566.030, 566.032, 566.031*, 566.060, 566.062, 566.064, 566.067, 566.068, 566.061*, 566.083, 566.101*, 566.100, 566.111, 566.151, 566.203, 566.206, 566.209, 566.211**, or 566.215;\n\nb.

(1) The court may modify an order granting or denying visitation rights whenever modification would serve the best interests of the child, but the court shall not restrict a parent's visitation rights unless it finds that the visitation would endanger the child's physical health or impair his or her emotional development.\n\n(2) (a) In any proceeding modifying visitation rights, the court shall not grant unsupervised visitation to a parent if the parent or any person residing with such parent has been found guilty of or pled guilty to any of the following offenses when a child was the victim:\n\na. A felony violation of section 566.030, 566.032, 566.031*, 566.060, 566.062, 566.064, 566.067, 566.068, 566.061*, 566.083, 566.101*, 566.100, 566.111, 566.151, 566.203, 566.206, 566.209, 566.211**, or 566.215;\n\nb.

The court shall mandate compliance with its order by all parties to the action, including parents, children and third parties. In the event of noncompliance, the aggrieved person may file a verified motion for contempt. If custody, visitation or third-party custody is denied or interfered with by a parent or third party without good cause, the aggrieved person may file a family access motion with the court stating the specific facts which constitute a violation of the judgment of dissolution, legal separation or judgment of paternity. The state courts administrator shall develop a simple form for pro se motions to the aggrieved person, which shall be provided to the person by the circuit clerk. Clerks, under the supervision of a circuit clerk, shall explain to aggrieved parties the procedures for filing the form. Notice of the fact that clerks will provide such assistance shall be conspicuously posted in the clerk's offices. The location of the office where the family access motion may be filed shall be conspicuously posted in the court building. The performance of duties described in this section shall not constitute the practice of law as defined in section 484.010. Such form for pro se motions shall not require the assistance of legal counsel to prepare and file. The cost of filing the motion shall be the standard court costs otherwise due for instituting a civil action in the circuit court.\n\n4. Within five court days after the filing of the family access motion pursuant to subsection 3 of this section, the clerk of the court shall issue a summons pursuant to applicable state law, and applicable local or supreme court rules. A copy of the motion shall be personally served upon the respondent by personal process server as provided by law or by any sheriff. Such service shall be served at the earliest time and shall take priority over service in other civil actions, except those of an emergency nature or those filed pursuant to chapter 455. The motion shall contain the following statement in boldface type:\n\n5. If an alternative dispute resolution program is available pursuant to section 452.372, the clerk shall also provide information to all parties on the availability of any such services, and within fourteen days of the date of service, the court may schedule alternative dispute resolution.\n\n6. Upon a finding by the court pursuant to a motion for a family access order or a motion for contempt that its order for custody, visitation or third-party custody has not been complied with, without good cause, the court shall order a remedy, which may include, but not be limited to:\n\n(1) A compensatory period of visitation, custody or third-party custody at a time convenient for the aggrieved party not less than the period of time denied;\n\n(2) Participation by the violator in counseling to educate the violator about the importance of providing the child with a continuing and meaningful relationship with both parents;\n\n(3) Assessment of a fine of up to five hundred dollars against the violator payable to the aggrieved party;\n\n(4) Requiring the violator to post bond or security to ensure future compliance with the court's access orders; and\n\n(5) Ordering the violator to pay the cost of counseling to reestablish the parent-child relationship between the aggrieved party and the child.\n\n7. The court shall consider, in a proceeding to enforce or modify a permanent custody or visitation order or judgment, a party's violation, without good cause, of a provision of the parenting plan, for the purpose of determining that party's ability and willingness to allow the child frequent and meaningful contact with the other party.\n\n8. The reasonable expenses incurred as a result of denial or interference with custody or visitation, including attorney's fees and costs of a proceeding to enforce visitation rights, custody or third-party custody, shall be assessed, if requested and for good cause, against the parent or party who unreasonably denies or interferes with visitation, custody or third-party custody. In addition, the court may utilize any and all powers relating to contempt conferred on it by law or rule of the Missouri supreme court.\n\n9. Final disposition of a motion for a family access order filed pursuant to this section shall take place not more than sixty days after the service of such motion, unless waived by the parties or determined to be in the best interest of the child. Final disposition shall not include appellate review.\n\n10. Motions filed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed an independent civil action from the original action pursuant to which the judgment or order sought to be enforced was entered.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 315 § 21, A.L. 1977 S.B. 430, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468, A.L. 1983 S.B. 94, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1272, et al., A.L. 1989 H.B. 422, A.L. 1993 S.B. 180, A.L. 1995 S.B. 174, A.L. 1998 S.B. 910, A.L. 1999 S.B. 1, et al., A.L. 2004 H.B. 1453, A.L. 2005 H.B. 568, A.L. 2013 S.B. 100, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1550)\n\n*The following sections were transferred by H.B. 215, 2013, effective 8-28-13: 566.040 to 566.031 566.070 to 566.061 566.090 to 566.101\n\n**The following sections were transferred by S.B. 491, 2014, effective 1-01-17: 566.212 to 566.211 568.080 to 573.200 568.090 to 573.205\n\n(1977) Where original decree is silent as to visitation rights no change of circumstance need be shown to authorize \"modification\" (really clarification) of visitation rights.

Military service includes a period during which a military parent remains subject to deployment orders and remains deployed on account of sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause;\n\n(3)\"Military parent\", a parent of a child less than eighteen years of age whose parental rights have not been terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction or a guardian of a child less than eighteen years of age who is a service member of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Guard, or any other reserve component thereof;\n\n(4)\"Nondeploying parent\", a parent or guardian not subject to deployment.\n\n2. If a military parent is required to be separated from a child due to deployment, a court shall not enter a final order modifying the terms establishing custody or visitation contained in an existing order until ninety days after the deployment ends unless there is a written agreement by both parties.\n\n3. In accordance with section 452.412, deployment or the potential for future deployment shall not be the sole factor supporting a change in circumstances or grounds sufficient to support a permanent modification of the custody or visitation terms established in an existing order.\n\n4. (1) An existing order establishing the terms of custody or visitation in place at the time a military parent is deployed may be temporarily modified to make reasonable accommodation for the parties due to the deployment.\n\n(2) A temporary modification order issued under this section shall provide that the deploying parent shall have custody of the child or reasonable visitation, whichever is applicable under the original order, during a period of leave granted to the deploying parent, unless it is not in the best interest of the child.\n\n(3) Any court order modifying a previously ordered custody or visitation due to deployment shall specify that the deployment is the basis for the order and shall be entered by the court as a temporary order.\n\n(4) Any such temporary custody or visitation order shall require the nondeploying parent to provide the court and the deploying parent with written notice of the nondeploying parent's address and telephone number, and update such information within seven days of any change. However, if a valid order of protection under chapter 455 from this or another jurisdiction is in effect that requires that the address or contact information of the parent who is not deployed be kept confidential, the notification shall be made to the court only, and a copy of the order shall be included in the notification. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to eliminate the requirements under section 452.377.\n\n(5) Upon motion of a deploying parent, with reasonable advance notice and for good cause shown, the court shall hold an expedited hearing in any custody or visitation matters instituted under this section when the military duties of the deploying parent have a material effect on his or her ability or anticipated ability to appear in person at a regularly scheduled hearing.\n\n5. (1) A temporary modification of such an order automatically ends no later than thirty days after the return of the deploying parent and the original terms of the custody or visitation order in place at the time of deployment are automatically reinstated.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall limit the power of the court to conduct an expedited or emergency hearing regarding custody or visitation upon return of the deploying parent, and the court shall do so within ten days of the filing of a motion alleging an immediate danger or irreparable harm to the child.\n\n(3) The nondeploying parent shall bear the burden of showing that reentry of the custody or visitation order in effect before the deployment is no longer in the child's best interests. The court shall set any nonemergency motion by the nondeploying parent for hearing within thirty days of the filing of the motion.\n\n6. (1) Upon motion of the deploying parent or upon motion of a family member of the deploying parent with his or her consent, the court may delegate his or her visitation rights, or a portion of such rights, to a family member with a close and substantial relationship to the minor child or children for the duration of the deployment if it is in the best interest of the child.\n\n(2) Such delegated visitation time or access does not create an entitlement or standing to assert separate rights to parent time or access for any person other than a parent, and shall terminate by operation of law upon the end of the deployment, as set forth in this section.\n\n(3) Such delegated visitation time shall not exceed the visitation time granted to the deploying parent under the existing order; except that, the court may take into consideration the travel time necessary to transport the child for such delegated visitation time.\n\n(4) In addition, there is a rebuttable presumption that a deployed parent's visitation rights shall not be delegated to a family member who has a history of perpetrating domestic violence as defined under section 455.010 against another family or household member, or delegated to a family member with an individual in the family member's household who has a history of perpetrating domestic violence against another family or household member.\n\n(5) The person or persons to whom delegated visitation time has been granted shall have full legal standing to enforce such rights.\n\n7. Upon motion of a deploying parent and upon reasonable advance notice and for good cause shown, the court shall permit such parent to present testimony and evidence by affidavit or electronic means in support, custody, and visitation matters instituted under this section when the military duties of such parent have a material effect on his or her ability to appear in person at a regularly scheduled hearing. Electronic means includes communication by telephone, video conference, or the internet.\n\n8. Any order entered under this section shall require that the nondeploying parent:\n\n(1) Make the child or children reasonably available to the deploying parent when the deploying parent has leave;\n\n(2) Facilitate opportunities for telephonic and electronic mail contact between the deploying parent and the child or children during deployment; and\n\n(3) Receive timely information regarding the deploying parent's leave schedule.\n\n9. (1) If there is no existing order establishing the terms of custody and visitation and it appears that deployment is imminent, upon the filing of initial pleadings and motion by either parent, the court shall expedite a hearing to establish temporary custody or visitation to ensure the deploying parent has access to the child, to ensure disclosure of information, to grant other rights and duties set forth in this section, and to provide other appropriate relief.\n\n(2) Any initial pleading filed to establish custody or visitation for a child of a deploying parent shall be so identified at the time of filing by stating in the text of the pleading the specific facts related to deployment.\n\n10. (1) Since military necessity may preclude court adjudication before deployment, the parties shall cooperate with each other in an effort to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of custody, visitation, and child support.\n\n(2) A deploying parent shall provide a copy of his or her orders to the nondeploying parent promptly and without delay prior to deployment. Notification shall be made within ten days of receipt of deployment orders. If less than ten days' notice is received by the deploying parent, notice shall be given immediately upon receipt of military orders. If all or part of the orders are classified or restricted as to release, the deploying parent shall provide, under the terms of this subdivision, all such nonclassified or nonrestricted information to the nondeploying parent.\n\n11. In an action brought under this chapter, whenever the court declines to grant or extend a stay of proceedings under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. Appendix Sections 521-522, and decides to proceed in the absence of the deployed parent, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the minor child's interests.\n\n12. Service of process on a nondeploying parent whose whereabouts are unknown may be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of section 506.160.\n\n13. In determining whether a parent has failed to exercise visitation rights, the court shall not count any time periods during which the parent did not exercise visitation due to the material effect of such parent's military duties on visitation time.\n\n14. Once an order for custody has been entered in Missouri, any absence of a child from this state during deployment shall be denominated a temporary absence for the purposes of application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). For the duration of the deployment, Missouri shall retain exclusive jurisdiction under the UCCJEA and deployment shall not be used as a basis to assert inconvenience of the forum under the UCCJEA.\n\n15. In making determinations under this section, the court may award attorney's fees and costs based on the court's consideration of:\n\n(1) The failure of either party to reasonably accommodate the other party in custody or visitation matters related to a military parent's service;\n\n(2) Unreasonable delay caused by either party in resolving custody or visitation related to a military parent's service;\n\n(3) Failure of either party to timely provide military orders, income, earnings, or payment information, housing or education information, or physical location of the child to the other party; and\n\n(4) Other factors as the court may consider appropriate and as may be required by law.\n\n(L. 2013 H.B. 148 merged with S.B. 106 merged with S.B. 110 merged with S.B. 117)\n\nEffective 8-28-13 (H.B. 148); 8-28-13 (S.B. 106); 8-28-13 (S.B. 117); 10-11-13 (S.B. 110)\n\n*S.B. 110 effective 10-11-13, see § 21.250.
