(1) Not later than fifteen days after the filing of a petition that meets the requirements of section 455.020, a hearing shall be held unless the court deems, for good cause shown, that a continuance should be granted. At the hearing, if the petitioner has proved the allegation of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault by a preponderance of the evidence, and the respondent cannot show that his or her actions alleged to constitute abuse were otherwise justified under the law, the court shall issue a full order of protection for a period of time the court deems appropriate, and unless after an evidentiary hearing the court makes specific written findings that the respondent poses a serious danger to the physical or mental health of the petitioner or of a minor household member of the petitioner, the protective order shall be valid for at least one hundred eighty days and not more than one year.

If the court has made specific written findings that the respondent poses a serious danger to the physical or mental health of the petitioner or of a minor household member of the petitioner, the renewed protective order may be renewed periodically and shall be valid for at least two years and up to the life of the respondent.\n\n(3) The court may, upon finding that it is in the best interest of the parties, include a provision that any full order of protection shall be automatically renewed for any term of renewal of a full order of protection as set forth in this section unless the respondent requests a hearing by thirty days prior to the expiration of the order. If for good cause a hearing cannot be held on the motion to renew or the objection to an automatic renewal of the full order of protection prior to the expiration date of the originally issued full order of protection, an ex parte order of protection may be issued until a hearing is held on the motion.

For purposes of this subsection, a finding by the court of a subsequent act of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault is not required for a renewal order of protection.\n\n(4) In determining under this section whether a respondent poses a serious danger to the physical or mental health of a petitioner or of a minor household member of the petitioner, the court shall consider all relevant evidence including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) The weight of the evidence;\n\n(b) The respondent's history of inflicting or causing physical harm, bodily injury, or assault;\n\n(c) The respondent's history of stalking or causing fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault on the petitioner or a minor household member of the petitioner;\n\n(d) The respondent's criminal record;\n\n(e) Whether any prior full orders of adult or child protection have been issued against the respondent;\n\n(f) Whether the respondent has been found guilty of any dangerous felony under Missouri law; and\n\n(g) Whether the respondent violated any term or terms of probation or parole or violated any term of a prior full or temporary order of protection and which violated terms were intended to protect the petitioner or a minor household member of the petitioner.\n\n(5) If a court finds that a respondent poses a serious risk to the physical or mental health of the petitioner or of a minor household member of the petitioner, the court shall not modify such order until a period of at least two years from the date the original full order was issued and only after the court makes specific written findings after a hearing held that the respondent has shown proof of treatment and rehabilitation and that the respondent no longer poses a serious danger to the petitioner or to a minor household member of the petitioner.\n\n2. The court shall cause a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing on such petition and any ex parte order of protection to be served upon the respondent as provided by law or by any sheriff or police officer at least three days prior to such hearing. The court shall cause a copy of any full order of protection to be served upon or mailed by certified mail to the respondent at the respondent's last known address. Notice of an ex parte or full order of protection shall be served at the earliest time, and service of such notice shall take priority over service in other actions, except those of a similar emergency nature. Failure to serve or mail a copy of the full order of protection to the respondent shall not affect the validity or enforceability of a full order of protection.\n\n3. A copy of any order of protection granted pursuant to sections 455.010 to 455.085 shall be issued to the petitioner and to the local law enforcement agency in the jurisdiction where the petitioner resides. The court shall provide all necessary information, including the respondent's relationship to the petitioner, for entry of the order of protection into the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Upon receiving the order under this subsection, the sheriff shall make the entry into MULES within twenty-four hours. MULES shall forward the order information to NCIC, which will in turn make the order viewable within the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The sheriff shall enter information contained in the order, including, but not limited to, any orders regarding child custody or visitation and all specifics as to times and dates of custody or visitation that are provided in the order. A notice of expiration or of termination of any order of protection or any change in child custody or visitation within that order shall be issued to the local law enforcement agency for entry into MULES or any other comparable law enforcement system.

The court shall ensure that the contact information of the petitioner is not provided to the accountholder in proceedings held under this chapter.\n\n(b) Upon issuance, a copy of the full order of protection shall be transmitted, either electronically or by certified mail, to the wireless service provider's registered agent listed with the secretary of state, or electronically to the email address provided by the wireless service provider. Such transmittal shall constitute adequate notice for the wireless service provider acting under this section and section 455.523.\n\n(c) If the wireless service provider cannot operationally or technically effectuate the order due to certain circumstances, the wireless service provider shall notify the petitioner within three business days. Such circumstances shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\na. The accountholder has already terminated the account;\n\nb.

A violation of the terms and conditions, with regard to domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, child custody, communication initiated by the respondent or entrance upon the premises of the petitioner's dwelling unit or place of employment or school, or being within a certain distance of the petitioner or a child of the petitioner, of an ex parte order of protection of which the respondent has notice, shall be a class A misdemeanor unless the respondent has previously pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty in any division of the circuit court of violating an ex parte order of protection or a full order of protection within five years of the date of the subsequent violation, in which case the subsequent violation shall be a class E felony. Evidence of prior pleas of guilty or findings of guilt shall be heard by the court out of the presence of the jury prior to submission of the case to the jury.

For the purposes of this subsection, in addition to the notice provided by actual service of the order, a party is deemed to have notice of an order of protection if:\n\n(1) The law enforcement officer responding to a call of a reported incident of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, or violation of an order of protection presented a copy of the order of protection to the respondent; or\n\n(2) Notice is given by actual communication to the respondent in a manner reasonably likely to advise the respondent.\n\n9. Good faith attempts to effect a reconciliation of a marriage shall not be deemed tampering with a witness or victim tampering under section 575.270.\n\n10.

For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Electronic monitoring with victim notification\", an electronic monitoring system that has the capability to track and monitor the movement of a person and immediately transmit the monitored person's location to the protected person and the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the protected premises through an appropriate means, including the telephone, an electronic beeper, or paging device whenever the monitored person enters the protected premises as specified in the order by the court;\n\n(2)\"Informed consent\", the protected person is given the following information before consenting to participate in electronic monitoring with victim notification:\n\n(a) The protected person's right to refuse to participate in such monitoring and the process for requesting the court to terminate his or her participation after it has been ordered;\n\n(b) The manner in which the electronic monitoring technology functions and the risks and limitations of that technology;\n\n(c) The boundaries imposed on the person being monitored during the electronic monitoring;\n\n(d) The sanctions that the court may impose for violations of the order issued by the court;\n\n(e) The procedure that the protected person is to follow if the monitored person violates an order or if the electronic monitoring equipment fails;\n\n(f) Identification of support services available to assist the protected person in developing a safety plan to use if the monitored person violates an order or if the electronic monitoring equipment fails;\n\n(g) Identification of community services available to assist the protected person in obtaining shelter, counseling, education, child care, legal representation, and other help in addressing the consequences and effects of domestic violence; and\n\n(h) The nonconfidential nature of the protected person's communications with the court concerning electronic monitoring and the restrictions to be imposed upon the monitored person's movements.\n\n2. When a person is found guilty of violating the terms and conditions of an ex parte or full order of protection under section 455.085 or 455.538, the court may, in addition to or in lieu of any other disposition:\n\n(1) Sentence the person to electronic monitoring with victim notification; or\n\n(2) Place the person on probation and, as a condition of such probation, order electronic monitoring with victim notification.\n\n3. When a person charged with violating the terms and conditions of an ex parte or full order of protection under section 455.085 or 455.538 is released from custody before trial pursuant to section 544.455, the court may, as a condition of release, order electronic monitoring of the person with victim notification.\n\n4. Electronic monitoring with victim notification shall be ordered only with the protected person's informed consent. In determining whether to place a person on electronic monitoring with victim notification, the court may hold a hearing to consider the likelihood that the person's participation in electronic monitoring will deter the person from injuring the protected person. The court shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) The gravity and seriousness of harm that the person inflicted on the protected person in the commission of any act of domestic violence;\n\n(2) The person's previous history of domestic violence;\n\n(3) The person's history of other criminal acts, if any;\n\n(4) Whether the person has access to a weapon;\n\n(5) Whether the person has threatened suicide or homicide;\n\n(6) Whether the person has a history of mental illness or has been civilly committed; and\n\n(7) Whether the person has a history of alcohol or substance abuse.\n\n5. Unless the person is determined to be indigent by the court, a person ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring with victim notification shall be ordered to pay the related costs and expenses. If the court determines the person is indigent, the person may be placed on electronic monitoring with victim notification, and the clerk of the court in which the case was determined shall notify the department of corrections that the person was determined to be indigent and shall include in a bill to the department the costs associated with the monitoring. The department shall establish by rule a procedure to determine the portion of costs each indigent person is able to pay based on a person's income, number of dependents, and other factors as determined by the department and shall seek reimbursement of such costs.\n\n6. An alert from an electronic monitoring device shall be probable cause to arrest the monitored person for a violation of an ex parte or full order of protection.\n\n7. The department of corrections, department of public safety, Missouri state highway patrol, the circuit courts, and county and municipal law enforcement agencies shall share information obtained via electronic monitoring conducted pursuant to this section.\n\n8. No supplier of a product, system, or service used for electronic monitoring with victim notification shall be liable, directly or indirectly, for damages arising from any injury or death associated with the use of the product, system, or service unless, and only to the extent that, such action is based on a claim that the injury or death was proximately caused by a manufacturing defect in the product or system.\n\n9. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting a court's ability to place a person on electronic monitoring without victim notification under section 544.455 or 557.011.\n\n10. A person shall be found guilty of the offense of tampering with electronic monitoring equipment under section 575.205 if he or she commits the actions prohibited under such section with any equipment that a court orders the person to wear under this section.\n\n11.

(1) Violation of the terms and conditions of an ex parte or full order of protection with regard to domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, child custody, communication initiated by the respondent, or entrance upon the premises of the victim's dwelling unit or place of employment or school, or being within a certain distance of the petitioner or a child of the petitioner, of which the respondent has notice, shall be a class A misdemeanor, unless the respondent has previously pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty in any division of the circuit court of violating an ex parte order of protection or a full order of protection within five years of the date of the subsequent violation, in which case the subsequent violation shall be a class E felony. Evidence of a prior plea of guilty or finding of guilt shall be heard by the court out of the presence of the jury prior to submission of the case to the jury. If the court finds the existence of a prior plea of guilty or finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other disposition and shall not instruct the jury as to the range of punishment or allow the jury to assess and declare the punishment as a part of its verdict.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, in addition to the notice provided by actual service of the order, a party is deemed to have notice of an order of protection for a child if the law enforcement officer responding to a call of a reported incident of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, or violation of an order of protection for a child presents a copy of the order of protection to the respondent.\n\n5. The fact that an act by a respondent is a violation of a valid order of protection for a child shall not preclude prosecution of the respondent for other crimes arising out of the incident in which the protection order is alleged to have been violated.\n\n(L. 1987 H.B. 598 § 16, A.L. 2011 S.B. 320, A.L. 2013 H.B. 215, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491, A.L. 2015 S.B. 321 merged with S.B. 341)\n\nEffective 1-01-17",
