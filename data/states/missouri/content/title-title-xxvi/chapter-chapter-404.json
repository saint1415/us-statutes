The custodian may deliver, pay over to the minor for expenditure by the minor, or expend for the minor's benefit, so much of the custodial property as the custodian determines advisable for the use and benefit of the minor, without court order and without regard to the duty or ability of the custodian in the custodian's individual capacity or of any other person to support the minor, or any other income or property of the minor.\n\n3. Upon the petition of a parent, guardian or conservator of a minor, an adult member of the minor's family, any person interested in the welfare of the minor, or of the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen years, the court may order the custodian to expend or to pay over to the minor or the minor's parent, guardian or conservator so much of the custodial property as the court determines advisable for the use and benefit of the minor.\n\n4.

If the incapacitated person has no conservator, the custodian may transfer the custodial property to any adult person or financial institution, including the custodian, as personal custodian for the incapacitated person under any law providing for custodianship of property for incapacitated adult persons.\n\n6. The custodian is under a duty to act in the interest of the minor and to avoid conflicts of interest that impair the custodian's ability to so act. In dealing with the custodial property, the custodian shall observe the degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that all investments made on or after August 28, 1998, shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Missouri prudent investor act, sections 469.900 to 469.913. The custodian is not limited by any other statute restricting investments or expenditures by fiduciaries. If the custodian has special skills or is named custodian on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, the custodian is under a duty to use those skills. The custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received under sections 404.005 to 404.094, and may hold money or securities in the financial institution or brokerage company to which the property was delivered by the transferor.\n\n7. The custodian may invest in and pay premiums out of custodial property for life or endowment insurance policies on the life of the minor or the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest, provided the insurance proceeds will be distributed on the death of the insured life to the minor, the minor's estate or the custodian in the custodian's representative capacity.\n\n8. Subject to the degree of care prescribed in subsection 6 of this section, the custodian, acting in the capacity of custodian for the benefit of the minor, has all rights, power and authority over the custodial property that unmarried, nonincapacitated adult owners have over their own property, except the power to make a gift of the minor's property unless the gift to be made is approved by a court.\n\n9. The custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest in property is sufficiently separate and distinct if the custodian's interest in the property is held as a tenant in common with the other owners of the property and the minor's proportional interest in the property is fixed. Custodial property is sufficiently so identified if it is held in the name of the custodian in the manner prescribed in section 404.707.\n\n10. The custodian may establish checking, savings or other similar accounts with financial institutions and brokers whereby both the custodian and the minor may withdraw money from the account or draw checks against the account. Money withdrawn from an account or checks written against an account by the minor shall be treated as a delivery of custodial property from the custodian to the minor.\n\n11. Subject to the degree of care prescribed in subsection 6 of this section, the custodian, acting in the capacity of custodian and for the benefit of the minor, may borrow money, lend money, acquire by lease the use of property for the minor, lease custodial property and enter into contracts under which the performance required by such agreements may extend beyond the date the custodianship terminates. The custodian shall hold property that is borrowed or leased for the minor as custodial property in the name of the custodian in the manner prescribed in section 404.047.\n\n12. The custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to the custodial property, including information necessary for preparation of the minor's tax returns, and make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent, the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen years, an adult member of the minor's family if the minor has no living parent, and a legal representative of the minor.\n\n13. The minor's custodian may comply with an agreement with a transferor of property to the minor, including an agreement respecting investment objectives, expenses, compensation, resignation and naming of successor custodians, to the extent that such agreement does not conflict with the custodian's obligations to the minor under sections 404.005 to 404.094.\n\n(L. 1985 S.B. 35, et al. § 5, A.L. 1989 H.B. 145, A.L. 1993 S.B. 277, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1571, A.L. 2006 S.B. 892)",

A person designated as a custodian may decline to serve by delivering a written renunciation to the person who made the designation or to the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If at the time of the transfer there is no substitute custodian who is able and willing to serve as custodian, the person who made the designation, a person with a power from the donor to designate a custodian, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian.\n\n2. The custodian may revocably designate at any time one or more successor custodians in a will or by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than a successor custodian. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the custodian's resignation, the designation of a successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed. Successor custodians serve in the order named in the event a prior named custodian declines or is not qualified to serve as custodian, or is deceased or incapacitated.\n\n3. A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor and the successor custodian and delivering the custodial property and records of the custodianship to the successor custodian.\n\n4. If the custodian dies or becomes incapacitated, the custodian's legal representative shall transfer the custodial property to a successor custodian. If no successor custodian has been effectively designated, the custodian's legal representative shall designate as successor custodian any adult person or financial institution in the manner prescribed in subsection 2 of this section and deliver the custodial property to the successor custodian.\n\n5. The designation of a successor custodian by a custodian or the custodian's legal representative may be included in the instrument placing custodial property into the name of the successor custodian.\n\n6. A custodian under the uniform gifts to minors law or similar law of any state may transfer custodial property to himself as custodian or to a successor custodian for the minor under the Missouri transfers to minors law in the manner prescribed in section 404.047.\n\n7. When a minor resides in a state other than Missouri, a custodian under the Missouri uniform gifts to minors law or the Missouri transfers to minors law may deliver the custodial property to any adult person or financial institution as a successor custodian for the minor under the uniform gifts to minors law, uniform transfers to minors law or similar law of the state where the minor resides, if, under the laws of that state, the custodianship will not terminate earlier than it would terminate under section 404.051 and the ownership of the custodial property will remain indefeasibly vested in the minor.\n\n8. If the custodian or custodian's legal representative does not timely designate a successor custodian, then:\n\n(1) If the minor is over fourteen years of age, the minor may designate an adult member of the minor's family, the minor's conservator or guardian if the minor has one, or a financial institution as successor custodian in the manner prescribed in subsection 2 of this section; or\n\n(2) If the minor is under fourteen years of age, the minor, a guardian or conservator of the minor, the transferor, legal representative of the transferor, an adult member of the minor's family or any person interested in the welfare of the minor, may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.\n\n9. A successor custodian shall hold the custodial property in the manner prescribed in section 404.047 and need not indicate the custodial capacity as a successor custodian.\n\n10. A custodian who resigns, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall do all things within that person's lawful power to put each item of the custodial property and the records of the custodianship in the possession and control of a successor custodian.\n\n11.

The personal custodian shall collect, hold, maintain, manage, invest and reinvest the custodial property. The personal custodian may accept a transfer of additional property for the same beneficiary into the personal custodianship and may consolidate into a single custodianship custodial property received for the same beneficiary from multiple transfers or transferors.\n\n2. The personal custodian shall deliver, pay over to the beneficiary for expenditure by the beneficiary or expend for the beneficiary's benefit so much of the custodial property as the beneficiary may from time to time direct. If the beneficiary is an incapacitated person, the personal custodian may deliver, pay over to the beneficiary for expenditure by the beneficiary or expend for the beneficiary's benefit so much of the custodial property as the personal custodian determines advisable for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and those members of the beneficiary's family who are legally entitled to support by the beneficiary or who were supported by the beneficiary at the time the beneficiary became incapacitated, without court order and without regard to the duty or ability of the personal custodian in the personal custodian's individual capacity or of any other person to support the beneficiary, or any other income or property of the beneficiary.\n\n3. (1) Upon the petition of the beneficiary, guardian or conservator of an incapacitated beneficiary, an adult member of a beneficiary's family or any person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary, the court may order the personal custodian to expend or to pay over to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's guardian or conservator so much of the custodial property as the court determines advisable for the use and benefit of the beneficiary.\n\n(2) Upon petition of a personal custodian, the beneficiary, an adult member of the beneficiary's family or any person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary, the probate division of the circuit court shall determine and declare whether the beneficiary is a disabled or incapacitated person.\n\n4. Any delivery, payment or expenditure under subsections 2 and 3 of this section is in addition to, not in substitution for, and does not affect the obligation of any person to support the incapacitated beneficiary or the incapacitated beneficiary's dependents.\n\n5. The personal custodian is under a duty to act in the interest of the beneficiary and to avoid conflicts of interest that impair the personal custodian's ability to so act. In dealing with the custodial property, the personal custodian shall follow the investment and other directions of a beneficiary who is not incapacitated and shall observe the degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that all investments made on or after August 28, 1998, shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Missouri prudent investor act, sections 469.900 to 469.913. The personal custodian is not limited by any other statute restricting investments or expenditures by fiduciaries. If the personal custodian has special skills or is named personal custodian on the basis of representation of special skills or expertise, the custodian is under a duty to use those skills. The personal custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate, may retain any custodial property received under sections 404.400 to 404.650, and may hold money or securities in the financial institution or brokerage company to which the property was delivered by the transferor.\n\n6. The personal custodian may invest in and pay premiums out of custodial property for life or endowment insurance policies on the life of the beneficiary or the life of another person in whom the beneficiary has an insurable interest, provided the insurance proceeds will be distributed on the death of the insured life to the beneficiary, the persons designated by an adult nonincapacitated beneficiary, the beneficiary's estate or the personal custodian in the personal custodian's representative capacity.\n\n7. Subject to the degree of care prescribed in subsection 5 of this section, the personal custodian, acting in the capacity of personal custodian for the benefit of the beneficiary, has all rights, power and authority over the custodial property that unmarried, nonincapacitated adult owners have over their own property, except the power to make a gift of the beneficiary's property (i) unless granted such power by a nonincapacitated beneficiary in a writing signed and dated, and acknowledged or proved and certified in the manner provided by law for conveyances of real estate, or (ii) unless the gift to be made is approved by a court under section 475.094.\n\n8. The personal custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner to identify it clearly as custodial property of the beneficiary. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest in property is sufficiently separate and distinct if the personal custodian's interest in the property is held as a tenant in common with the other owners of the property and the beneficiary's proportional interest in the property is fixed. Custodial property is sufficiently so identified if it is held in the name of the personal custodian in the manner prescribed in section 404.540.\n\n9. The personal custodian may establish checking, savings or other similar accounts with financial institutions and brokers whereby both the personal custodian and the beneficiary may withdraw money from the account or draw or issue checks or drafts against the account. Money withdrawn from an account or checks written against an account by the beneficiary shall be treated as a delivery of custodial property from the personal custodian to the beneficiary.\n\n10.

An agreement to act on behalf of the principal is enforceable against the attorney in fact as a fiduciary without regard to whether there is any consideration to support a contractual obligation to do so.

A principal may delegate to an attorney in fact in a power of attorney general powers to act in a fiduciary capacity on the principal's behalf with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes or with respect to one or more express subjects or purposes. A power of attorney with general powers may be durable or not durable.\n\n2. If the power of attorney states that general powers are granted to the attorney in fact and further states in substance that it grants power to the attorney in fact to act with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes or that it grants general powers for general purposes or does not by its terms limit the power to the specific subject or purposes set out in the instrument, then the authority of the attorney in fact acting under the power of attorney shall extend to and include each and every action or power which an adult who is nondisabled and nonincapacitated may carry out through an agent specifically authorized in the premises, with respect to any and all matters whatsoever, except as provided in subsections 6 and 7 of this section. When a power of attorney grants general powers to an attorney in fact to act with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes, the enumeration of one or more specific subjects or purposes does not limit the general authority granted by that power of attorney, unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney.\n\n3. If the power of attorney states that general powers are granted to an attorney in fact with respect to one or more express subjects or purposes for which general powers are conferred, then the authority of the attorney in fact acting under the power of attorney shall extend to and include each and every action or power, but only with respect to the specific subjects or purposes expressed in the power of attorney that an adult who is nondisabled and nonincapacitated may carry out through an agent specifically authorized in the premises, with respect to any and all matters whatsoever, except as provided in subsections 6 and 7 of this section.\n\n4. Except as provided in subsections 6 and 7 of this section, an attorney in fact with general powers has, with respect to the subjects or purposes for which the powers are conferred, all rights, power and authority to act for the principal that the principal would have with respect to his or her own person or property, including property owned jointly or by the entireties with another or others, as a nondisabled and nonincapacitated adult; and without limiting the foregoing has with respect to the subjects or purposes of the power complete discretion to make a decision for the principal, to act or not act, to consent or not consent to, or withdraw consent for, any act, and to execute and deliver or accept any deed, bill of sale, bill of lading, assignment, contract, note, security instrument, consent, receipt, release, proof of claim, petition or other pleading, tax document, notice, application, acknowledgment or other document necessary or convenient to implement or confirm any act, transaction or decision. An attorney in fact with general powers, whether power to act with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes, or only with respect to one or more express subjects or purposes, shall have the power, unless specifically denied by the terms of the power of attorney, to make, execute and deliver to or for the benefit of or at the request of a third person, who is requested to rely upon an action of the attorney in fact, an agreement indemnifying and holding harmless any third person or persons from any liability, claims or expenses, including legal expenses, incurred by any such third person by reason of acting or refraining from acting pursuant to the request of the attorney in fact, and such indemnity agreement shall be binding upon the principal who has executed such power of attorney and upon the principal's successor or successors in interest. No such indemnity agreement shall protect any third person from any liability, claims or expenses incurred by reason of the fact that, and to the extent that, the third person has honored the power of attorney for actions outside the scope of authority granted by the power of attorney. In addition, the attorney in fact has complete discretion to employ and compensate real estate agents, brokers, attorneys, accountants and subagents of all types to represent and act for the principal in any and all matters, including tax matters involving the United States government or any other government or taxing entity, including, but not limited to, the execution of supplemental or additional powers of attorney in the name of the principal in form that may be required or preferred by any such taxing entity or other third person, and to deal with any or all third persons in the name of the principal without limitation. No such supplemental or additional power of attorney shall broaden the scope of authority granted to the attorney in fact in the original power of attorney executed by the principal.\n\n5. An attorney in fact, who is granted general powers for all subjects and purposes or with respect to any express subjects or purposes, shall exercise the powers conferred according to the principal's instructions, in the principal's best interest, in good faith, prudently and in accordance with sections 404.712 and 404.714.\n\n6. Any power of attorney, whether durable or not durable, and whether or not it grants general powers for all subjects and purposes or with respect to express subjects or purposes, shall be construed to grant power or authority to an attorney in fact to carry out any of the actions described in this subsection if the actions are expressly enumerated and authorized in the power of attorney. Any power of attorney may grant power of authority to an attorney in fact to carry out any of the following actions if the actions are expressly authorized in the power of attorney:\n\n(1) To execute, amend or revoke any trust agreement;\n\n(2) To fund with the principal's assets any trust not created by the principal;\n\n(3) To make or revoke a gift of the principal's property in trust or otherwise;\n\n(4) To disclaim a gift or devise of property to or for the benefit of the principal, including but not limited to the ability to disclaim or release any power of appointment granted to the principal and the ability to disclaim all or part of the principal's interest in appointive property to the extent authorized under sections 456.970 to 456.1135;\n\n(5) To create or change survivorship interests in the principal's property or in property in which the principal may have an interest; provided, however, that the inclusion of the authority set out in this subdivision shall not be necessary in order to grant to an attorney in fact acting under a power of attorney granting general powers with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes the authority to withdraw funds or other property from any account, contract or other similar arrangement held in the names of the principal and one or more other persons with any financial institution, brokerage company or other depository to the same extent that the principal would be authorized to do if the principal were present, not disabled or incapacitated, and seeking to act in the principal's own behalf;\n\n(6) To designate or change the designation of beneficiaries to receive any property, benefit or contract right on the principal's death;\n\n(7) To give or withhold consent to an autopsy or postmortem examination;\n\n(8) To make an anatomical gift of, or prohibit an anatomical gift of, all or part of the principal's body under the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act or to exercise the right of sepulcher over the principal's body under section 194.119;\n\n(9) To nominate a guardian or conservator for the principal; and if so stated in the power of attorney, the attorney in fact may nominate himself as such;\n\n(10) To give consent to or prohibit any type of health care, medical care, treatment or procedure to the extent authorized by sections 404.800 to 404.865;\n\n(11) To designate one or more substitute or successor or additional attorneys in fact; or\n\n(12) To exercise, to revoke or amend the release of, or to contract to exercise or not to exercise, any power of appointment granted to the principal to the extent authorized under sections 456.970 to 456.1135.\n\n7. No power of attorney, whether durable or not durable, and whether or not it delegates general powers, may delegate or grant power or authority to an attorney in fact to do or carry out any of the following actions for the principal:\n\n(1) To make, publish, declare, amend or revoke a will for the principal;\n\n(2) To make, execute, modify or revoke a living will declaration for the principal;\n\n(3) To require the principal, against his or her will, to take any action or to refrain from taking any action; or\n\n(4) To carry out any actions specifically forbidden by the principal while not under any disability or incapacity.\n\n8. A third person may freely rely on, contract and deal with an attorney in fact delegated general powers with respect to the subjects and purposes encompassed or expressed in the power of attorney without regard to whether the power of attorney expressly identifies the specific property, account, security, storage facility or matter as being within the scope of a subject or purpose contained in the power of attorney, and without regard to whether the power of attorney expressly authorizes the specific act, transaction or decision by the attorney in fact.\n\n9. It is the policy of this state that an attorney in fact acting pursuant to the provisions of a power of attorney granting general powers shall be accorded the same rights and privileges with respect to the personal welfare, property and business interests of the principal, and if the power of attorney enumerates some express subjects or purposes, with respect to those subjects or purposes, as if the principal himself or herself were personally present and acting or seeking to act; and any provision of law and any purported waiver, consent or agreement executed or granted by the principal to the contrary shall be void and unenforceable.\n\n10. Sections 404.700 to 404.735 shall not be construed to preclude any person or business enterprise from providing in a contract with the principal as to the procedure that thereafter must be followed by the principal or the principal's attorney in fact in order to give a valid notice to the person or business enterprise of any modification or termination of the appointment of an attorney in fact by the principal; and any such contractual provision for notice shall be valid and binding on the principal and the principal's successors so long as such provision is reasonably capable of being carried out.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 145 § 5, A.L. 1991 S.B. 148, A.L. 1997 S.B. 265, A.L. 2011 S.B. 59, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1765)",

An attorney in fact who elects to act under a power of attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to avoid conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact so to act. A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power of attorney, either durable or not durable, who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the power of attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers conferred in the best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing and conflicts of interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the trustee's beneficiary or beneficiaries; and in the absence of explicit authorization, the attorney in fact shall exercise a high degree of care in maintaining, without modification, any estate plan which the principal may have in place, including, but not limited to, arrangements made by the principal for disposition of assets at death through beneficiary designations, ownership by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, trust arrangements or by will or codicil. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney or in a separate agreement between the principal and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact who elects to act shall exercise the authority granted in a power of attorney with that degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that all investments made on or after August 28, 1998, shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Missouri prudent investor act, sections 469.900 to 469.913. If the attorney in fact has special skills or was appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills in the principal's behalf.\n\n2. On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, an attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the principal, to communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow the instructions of the principal.\n\n3. If the principal is not available to communicate in person with the attorney in fact because:\n\n(1) The principal is missing under such circumstances that it is not known whether the principal is alive or dead; or\n\n(2) The principal is captured, interned, besieged or held hostage or prisoner in a foreign country;­­the authority of the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, whether durable or not, shall not terminate and the attorney in fact may continue to exercise the authority conferred, faithfully and in the best interests of the principal, until the principal returns or is publicly declared dead by a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, or is presumed dead because of continuous absence of five years as provided in section 472.290, RSMo 1986, or a similar law of the place of the last known domicile of the person whose absence is in question.\n\n­­the authority of the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, whether durable or not, shall not terminate and the attorney in fact may continue to exercise the authority conferred, faithfully and in the best interests of the principal, until the principal returns or is publicly declared dead by a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, or is presumed dead because of continuous absence of five years as provided in section 472.290, RSMo 1986, or a similar law of the place of the last known domicile of the person whose absence is in question.\n\n4. If, following execution of a power of attorney, the principal is absent or becomes wholly or partially disabled or incapacitated, or if there is a question with regard to the ability or capacity of the principal to give instructions to and supervise the acts and transactions of the attorney in fact, an attorney in fact exercising authority under a power of attorney, either durable or not durable, may consult with any person or persons previously designated by the principal for such purpose, and may also consult with and obtain information from the principal's spouse, physician, attorney, accountant, any member of the principal's family or other person, corporation or government agency with respect to matters to be undertaken in the principal's behalf and affecting the principal's personal affairs, welfare, family, property and business interests.\n\n5. If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court appoints a legal representative for the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow the instructions of the court or of the legal representative, and shall communicate with and be accountable to the principal's guardian on matters affecting the principal's personal welfare and to the principal's conservator on matters affecting the principal's property and business interests, to the extent that the responsibilities of the guardian or conservator and the authority of the attorney in fact involve the same subject matter.\n\n6. The authority of an attorney in fact, under a power of attorney that is not durable, is suspended during any period that the principal is disabled or incapacitated to the extent that the principal is unable to receive or evaluate information or to communicate decisions with respect to the subject of the power of attorney; and an attorney in fact exercising authority under a power of attorney that is not durable shall not act in the principal's behalf during any period that the attorney in fact knows the principal is so disabled or incapacitated.\n\n7. An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the principal's legal representative or a court, and the oral and written instructions of the principal, or the written instructions of the principal's legal representative or a court.\n\n8. An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney that the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate on, the happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as determined in a manner prescribed in the instrument.\n\n9. On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow the instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate of the principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the principal's successors; and the attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and put in the possession and control of the principal's personal representative or successors any property of the principal and copies of any records of the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in the principal's behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or the court to be necessary or helpful in the administration of the decedent's estate.\n\n10. If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact is otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the principal, this section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact that would conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 145 § 7, A.L. 1997 S.B. 265, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1571, A.L. 2006 S.B. 892)",

This section does not prohibit the principal, acting individually, and the person designated as the attorney in fact from entering into a written agreement that sets forth their duties and liabilities as between themselves and their successors, and which expands or limits the application of sections 404.700 to 404.735, with the exception of those acts enumerated in subsection 7 of section 404.710.\n\n5.

The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the principal's attorney in fact or the legal representative of the attorney in fact. If the principal is disabled, incapacitated or deceased, a petition for accounting may be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the principal.\n\n2. Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or by a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all creditors and distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims or distributions theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval or waiver shall be in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed with the court.\n\n3. For the purposes of subsection 2 of this section, a legal representative or a person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be considered a creditor of the principal's estate; and no express approval or waiver shall be required from the legal representative of a disabled or incapacitated principal if the principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the personal representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any other person entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered to a disabled, incapacitated or deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the principal's estate is unable to pay in full the compensation and expense to which the person rendering the services may be entitled.\n\n4. The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member of the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the principal may petition the probate division of the circuit court in the county or city where the principal is then residing to determine and declare whether a principal, who has executed a power of attorney, is a disabled or incapacitated person.\n\n5. If the principal is a disabled or incapacitated person, on petition of the principal's legal representative, an adult member of the principal's family or any interested person, including a person interested in the welfare of the principal, for good cause shown the court, may:\n\n(1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a particular purpose;\n\n(2) Modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;\n\n(3) Declare suspended a power of attorney that is not durable;\n\n(4) Terminate a durable power of attorney;\n\n(5) Remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;\n\n(6) Confirm the authority of an attorney in fact or a successor attorney in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and\n\n(7) Issue such other orders as the court finds will be in the best interest of the disabled or incapacitated principal, including appointment of a guardian or conservator for the principal.\n\n6. If, after notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a prima facie showing that the principal is a disabled or incapacitated person and that the attorney in fact has breached his fiduciary duty to the principal or that there is a reasonable likelihood that he may do so in the immediate future, the court may, in its discretion, issue an order that some or all of the authority granted by the power of attorney be suspended or modified, and that a different attorney in fact be authorized to exercise some or all of the powers granted by the power of attorney. Such attorney in fact may be designated by the court. The court may require any person petitioning for any such order to file a bond in such amount and with such sureties as required by the court to indemnify either the attorney in fact who has been acting on behalf of the principal or the principal and the principal's successors in interest for the expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by any such persons with respect to such proceeding. The court may, after hearing, allow payment or enter judgment for any such amount in the manner as provided by subsection 6 of section 404.731. None of the actions described in this subsection shall be taken by the court until after hearing upon reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified statement supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action identifying the immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons known to the petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal; except that in the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the court may, without notice, enter such temporary order as seems proper to the court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than thirty days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to the persons identified as herein provided.\n\n7. If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court or the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.\n\n8. In a proceeding under sections 404.700 to 404.735 or in any other proceeding, or upon petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:\n\n(1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney to account;\n\n(2) Authorize the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney to enter into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is, was or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power to authorize for a guardian or conservator under chapter 475; and\n\n(3) Relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise authority for a disabled or incapacitated principal under a durable power of attorney.\n\n9. Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation, any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach of duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has received an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter unless a proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within two years after receipt of the account or statement by him or, if the principal is a disabled or incapacitated person, by a guardian or conservator of his estate; provided that, if a disabled or incapacitated person has no guardian or conservator of his estate at the time an account or statement is presented, then the cause of action shall not be barred until one year after the removal of the principal's disability or incapacity, one year after the appointment of a conservator for the principal, or one year after the death of the principal. The cause of action thus barred does not include any action to recover from an attorney in fact or successor for fraud, misrepresentation or concealment related to the settlement of any transaction involving the agency relationship of the attorney in fact with the principal.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 145 § 13, A.L. 1997 S.B. 265)",
