Each person shall pay a registration fee equal to one-twentieth of one percent of the amount by which the maximum aggregate offering price at which the registered securities are to be offered in this state exceeds one hundred thousand dollars. In no case shall the registration fee be more than nine hundred dollars. If a registration statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is issued under section 409.3-306, the commissioner shall retain a filing fee of one hundred dollars. A person filing a renewal of a registration statement shall pay a filing fee of one hundred dollars.\n\n(c) A registration statement filed under section 409.3-303 or 409.3-304 must specify:\n\n(1) The amount of securities to be offered in this state;\n\n(2) The states in which a registration statement or similar record in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed; and\n\n(3) Any adverse order, judgment, or decree issued in connection with the offering by a state securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a court.\n\n(d) A record filed under this act or the predecessor act within five years preceding the filing of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the record is currently accurate.\n\n(e) In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record may not be required under subsection (i) or section 409.3-304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable effort or expense.\n\n(f) A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous five years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere. The conditions of any escrow or impoundment required under this subsection may be established by rule adopted or order issued under this act, but the commissioner may not reject a depository institution solely because of its location in another state.\n\n(g) A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a condition of registration that a security registered under this act be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed under this act or preserved for a period specified by the rule or order, which may not be longer than five years.\n\n(h) Except while a stop order is in effect under section 409.3-306, a registration statement is effective for one year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order under this act during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker-dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. A registration statement remains effective for each additional year by filing a renewal as described by rule adopted or order issued under this act. For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this act are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one year after its effective date.

The post-effective amendment becomes effective when the commissioner so orders.

If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.\n\n(c) If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b), a hearing before the commissioner must be provided. A final order may not be issued unless the commissioner makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with the provisions of chapter 536 and procedural rules promulgated by the commissioner. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection (a).\n\n(d) In a final order under subsection (c), the commissioner may:\n\n(1) Impose a civil penalty up to twenty-five thousand dollars for each violation;\n\n(2) Order a person subject to the order to pay restitution for any loss, including the amount of any actual damages that may have been caused by the conduct and interest at the rate of eight percent per year from the date of the violation causing the loss or disgorge any profits arising from the violation;\n\n(3) In addition to any civil penalty otherwise provided by law, impose an additional civil penalty not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars for each such violation if the commissioner finds that a person subject to the order has violated any provision of this act and that such violation was committed against an elderly or disabled person. For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(A)\"Disabled person\", a person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment;\n\n(B)\"Elderly person\", a person sixty years of age or older.\n\n(e) In a final order, the commissioner may charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act. These funds may be paid into the investor education and protection fund.\n\n(f) If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with section 409.6-609, the commissioner may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.\n\n(g) If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court may not require the commissioner to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not less than five thousand dollars but not greater than one hundred thousand dollars for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.\n\n(h) The commissioner is authorized to issue administrative consent orders in the settlement of any proceeding in the public interest under this act.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 380, A.L. 2009 H.B. 62, A.L. 2020 S.B. 599)",

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2003, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 380)\n\nEffective 9-01-03, see § 409.7-701",
