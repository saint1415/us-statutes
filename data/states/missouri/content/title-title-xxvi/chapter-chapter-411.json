Before any person is granted a license pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the person shall file a bond other than personal security with the director executed by the warehouseman as principal and by a corporate surety licensed to do business in this state as a surety. The bond shall be in favor of the state of Missouri for the benefit of all persons storing grain, their legal representatives, attorneys, or assigns, conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duties as a public warehouseman relating to the storage of grain. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the bond provided shall only cover storage grain deposited with a warehouseman. Storage grain that has been priced, as provided in section 411.325, shall not be covered by the warehouse bond. Grain deemed storage grain pursuant to section 411.325 shall be covered.\n\n2. Neither the issuance of warehouse receipts by a warehouseman to himself for grain owned in whole or in part by him; the commingling of grain owned by the warehouseman with grain stored for others or any violation by a warehouseman of this chapter or of the regulations promulgated hereunder by the director is a defense in any action brought upon any bond, and all bonds shall so provide.\n\n3. The surety bond required by this section shall be effective on the date of issue, shall not be affected by the expiration of the license period, and shall continue in full force and effect until cancelled.\n\n4. The required bond shall be kept in force at all times while the operator is conducting a public grain warehouse. Failure to keep such bond in force is cause for revocation of the license, and the warehouseman is subject to the penalties provided in this chapter. No warehouseman may cancel an approved bond without the prior written approval of the director and his approval of a substitute bond.\n\n5. A warehouseman filing bonds required under this chapter, or regulations promulgated hereunder, shall utilize the same corporate surety for all bonds required for the operation of any one warehouse.\n\n6. In case any person shall make application for licenses for two or more separate public warehouses in this state, he may give a single bond covering all such applications, and the amount of the bond shall be the total of the amounts which would be required for the several applications if separate bonds were given; except, however, that in computing the amount of the single bond the warehouseman may add together the capacity of all warehouses to be covered thereby and use the aggregate capacity for the purpose of computing bond. When a warehouseman elects to provide a single bond for a number of warehouses, the total assets of all the warehouses shall be subject to liabilities of each individual warehouse.\n\n7. Upon written demand of the director for payment, the surety shall either pay over to the director the sum demanded up to the full face amount of the bond, or shall deposit the sum demanded in an interest-bearing escrow account at the highest rate of interest available. When a surety pays the director upon demand, the director shall either interplead the sum in court or hold an administrative hearing for the determination of the liability of the surety, and the validity of claims against the bond, and upon the conclusion thereof, the director shall distribute the bond proceeds accordingly. The determination of the director shall be final, subject to the surety's or a claimant's right to appeal to the circuit court pursuant to the provisions of chapter 536. Refusal or failure of the surety to pay the sum demanded to the director within ten days of receipt of the director's demand letter or the refusal or failure to deposit the sum demanded in an interest-bearing escrow account at the highest rate of interest available, shall be grounds for withdrawal of the surety's license and authorization to conduct business in this state and grounds for the court to penalize the surety for refusal to pay or to deposit, within the ten days of demand, in the amount of twenty-five percent of the full face amount of the bond, plus interest at the rate of nine percent, or at the rate that the director can establish he would have received had the money been paid or deposited by the surety, whichever rate of interest is higher. In the event that the surety pays as demanded and the director or court determines the surety is not liable, the director shall return to the surety the sum paid to the director plus all accumulated interest, or any pro rata part of the sum, plus interest, as applicable in the event of liability less than the sum demanded. In the event that the surety elects to deposit the demanded sum in an interest-bearing escrow account and the director holds an administrative hearing determining the liability of the surety and the validity of claims, and upon the exhaustion of appeals, if any, the surety immediately shall pay to the director for distribution to claimants the amount for which the surety has been determined to be liable plus accumulated interest on that amount.\n\n8. Every bond filed shall contain a provision that it may not be cancelled by the principal or surety company except upon ninety days prior notice in writing, by certified mail, to the director at his Jefferson City office. In the case of a surety giving notice of cancellation, a copy of such notice shall be mailed on the same day by certified mail to the principal. The cancellation does not affect the liability accrued or which may accrue under such bond before the expiration of the ninety days. The notice shall contain the termination date. In the event such procedures are not followed, the bond shall remain in full force and effect until properly cancelled.\n\n9. Whenever the director receives notice from a surety that it intends to cancel the bond of a warehouseman, the director shall automatically suspend the warehouseman's license if a new bond is not received by the director within thirty days of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel. The director shall cause an inspection of the licensed warehouse immediately at the end of such thirty-day period. If a new bond is not received within sixty days of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the director shall revoke the warehouse license. The director shall cause a further inspection of the warehouse at the end of this sixty-day period. Such inspection may include an attempt to notify all possible grain and grain-related claimants of the warehouseman by advertising in local media. When a license is so revoked, the director shall give notice of such revocation to each depositor or holder of an outstanding negotiable or nonnegotiable warehouse receipt of which the director has knowledge. The director shall further notify each depositor or receipt holder that grain must be sold or removed from the warehouse. Upon receipt of the notice, it shall be the legal duty of each depositor or receipt holder to sell, remove, or cause his grain to be removed. Such notice to each receipt holder or depositor shall be sent by ordinary mail to the last known address of each receipt holder or depositor.\n\n10. The director may petition the circuit court for a mandatory injunction ordering the receipt holder or depositor to so sell, remove or cause to be removed, his grain and the circuit courts are hereby empowered to enter such an order. A hearing shall be held within ten days of the filing of any such petition. Notice of hearing to depositors, receipt holders, warehouseman, surety, all interested persons, and the director shall be by any practicable means effecting actual notice. Further, the circuit courts are empowered to enter any order, pertaining to the warehouseman, director, surety, or other interested persons, that is appropriate in the circumstances to effectuate such removal or sale consistent with the purpose of this chapter. The court may enforce any order entered pursuant to this section by its contempt powers or as otherwise provided by law.\n\n11. The director shall cause a final inspection of the licensed warehouse immediately after the end of the ninety-day period. The warehouseman shall pay a fee for each examination provided for in this section. The fee shall be computed in accordance with subsection 3 of section 411.271.\n\n12. Verbal or written surety bond binders issued by a surety on behalf of a grain warehouseman for original or replacement bonds are hereby recognized as legally effective in the state of Missouri as if the bond were fully executed when such binders meet the following conditions:\n\n(1) The warehouseman, or principal, has paid or has promised to pay the surety an agreed upon or tentatively agreed upon premium or other consideration;\n\n(2) The surety provides the department, either in writing, or verbally:\n\n(a) A bond number;\n\n(b) The amount of the bond;\n\n(c) The effective date of the bond;\n\n(d) Either verbal or written assurance that the person providing the preceding information has authority to commit the surety.­­Such binders may be cancelled only in the manner provided in subsection 8 of this section.

Upon receiving an original application, the director may make an examination of the warehouse covered by the application. The director shall issue a license to operate a public grain warehouse if he determines that:\n\n(1) The application is sufficient;\n\n(2) The warehouse facility is suitable for the proper storage of grain. The director shall determine the suitability of the warehouse for the storage of grain based upon the type, location, construction, layout and facilities of each warehouse. The warehouse facility shall have at least ten thousand bushel storage capacity. An adequate scale for weighing grain must be available for the warehouseman's use on site or within a reasonable distance of the warehouse facility, not to exceed five miles. The director's findings shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\n(a) The storage facilities are weathertight so as to protect the grain from the elements at all times;\n\n(b) The facilities and the practices with respect to those facilities are such as to maintain and preserve the quantity and quality of the grain;\n\n(c) Safe and adequate means of ingress and egress to the various storage units of the warehouse are provided and maintained by the warehouseman;\n\n(3) The applicant is capable of performing the service proposed;\n\n(4) The applicant is willing and able to comply with the provisions of this chapter and regulations promulgated hereunder;\n\n(5) The applicant, or, if the applicant is a corporation or partnership, any officer, majority shareholder, board member or partner has not been involved in illegal or improper manipulation of grain inventories which involved or resulted in losses to grain depositors within the seven-year period of time immediately preceding the date the director received the application;\n\n(6) The applicant has sufficient financial resources to adequately protect depositors; except that, if the director finds that the applicant, management personnel, a principal officer or partner has a bad business reputation, the director may deny the application. If the director is not satisfied with the applicant's qualifications as stated in this section, the application may be denied. If the application is denied, notice shall be mailed to the applicant setting forth the reasons for the denial of the license. Within fifteen days of receipt of a notice of denial for license, the applicant may file a written application with the director for a hearing on the denial. The hearing shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and regulations promulgated hereunder.\n\n2. Every license shall be dated and shall expire on the last day of the fifth month after the close of the warehouse's fiscal year, except that the initial licensing period after April 22, 1986, shall be for at least six months but not longer than eighteen, and shall designate the name of the licensee and the location of the warehouse. No fees shall be prorated.\n\n3. Every license shall be, at all times during the operation of the licensed warehouse, posted in a conspicuous place in the office room of the warehouse. Upon proof, satisfactory to the director, that a public grain warehouse license issued under this chapter has been destroyed or lost, the director may issue to the warehouse a duplicate license, with \"DUPLICATE\" clearly printed on its face. The fee for such duplicate license is ten dollars.\n\n4. If the holder of any public warehouseman's license is convicted of any violation of this chapter, or if the director determines that any holder has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, or any of the rules and regulations adopted by the director under the provisions of this chapter, the director may at his discretion modify, suspend, cancel, revoke or refuse to renew the license of the holder.\n\n5. Whenever the director shall modify, suspend, cancel, revoke or refuse to issue any license he shall prepare an order so providing which shall be signed by the director or some person designated by him, and the order shall state the reason or reasons for the modification, suspension, cancellation, revocation or refusal to issue the license. The order shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee or applicant at the address of the warehouse licensed or applying for a license. Within thirty days after the mailing of the order, the licensee, if aggrieved by the order of the director, may appeal as provided in chapter 536. At the time of the filing of the appeal, the party appealing shall give a bond for costs conditioned on his prosecuting the appeal without delay and paying all costs assessed against him. In addition, the licensee shall post a bond which shall remain in effect pending final disposition of all appeals, including review by the Missouri court of appeals or Missouri supreme court, or federal review, in an amount sufficient to cover all grain storage and grain-related obligations of the licensee as identified by the director. The posting of such bond is jurisdictional to the circuit court's authority to entertain the appeal.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if, upon examination, it is determined that a licensed warehouseman has violated or is violating any of the provisions of this chapter, and the director has reasonable cause to believe that the nature of the violation is such that there exists an immediate danger of substantial loss, the director may authorize and cause any employee charged with the enforcement of this chapter to remove the warehouseman's license to operate a public grain warehouse from the premises of the warehouse. Any license so removed shall be returned to the director. The removal of the license from the premises shall constitute a temporary suspension of the license.

In cases where a part of the grain represented by the receipt, or receipts, is delivered out of store and a remainder is left, the director shall prescribe the form of the document for the remainder of the grain and the manner in which it is to be issued.\n\n2. In case it is desirable to divide one receipt into two or more, or in the case it is desirable to consolidate two or more receipts into one and the warehouseman consents, the original receipt, or receipts, shall be cancelled in the same manner as if the grain had been delivered from store and the new receipt, or receipts, shall express on the face thereof that the new receipt, or receipts, represent a part of another receipt or the consolidation of other receipts, as the case may be, and the number and the date of the original receipt shall also appear on the new receipt issued in lieu thereof. No consolidation of receipts differing more than thirty days in date shall be permitted. All new receipts issued for old ones cancelled, as herein provided, shall bear the notation of the date of the receipt as originally issued.\n\n3. A warehouseman shall not deliver grain for which he has issued a negotiable receipt until the receipt has been returned to him and cancelled, and shall not deliver grain for which he has issued a nonnegotiable receipt until the receipt has been returned to him or he has obtained from the person lawfully entitled to the delivery, or his authorized agent, a written order therefor. Before delivery is made of the last portion of a lot of grain covered by a nonnegotiable receipt, the receipt itself shall be surrendered.\n\n(L. 1965 p. 606)",

Insufficient inventory, procedure to correct — insolvency, director may modify, suspend or revoke license or request order to be named trustee, procedure, order — warehouseman may appeal, how. —1. Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the director that a warehouseman does not have in his inventory sufficient grain to cover the outstanding receipts and scale tickets issued or assumed by him, or when the warehouseman refuses to submit his records or property to lawful examination, the director may give notice to the warehouseman to comply with any of the following requirements:\n\n(1) Immediately cease all grain-related operations and transactions such as, but not limited to, shipping, receiving, handling, processing or selling of grain on his own account or the account of others;\n\n(2) Cover the shortage by supplying the grain or evidence of ownership of the grain;\n\n(3) Submit to such examination as the director may deem necessary;\n\n(4) Immediately purchase and make actual payment for a sufficient quantity and quality of grain to fully cover the shortage. If the warehouseman fails to comply with the requirements contained in the notice within the time period which the director may allow, the director may petition the circuit court of the county where the warehouse is located for an ex parte order authorizing the director or his authorized agent to seize and take possession, as trustee, of any grain located in the warehouse of such warehouseman, and of all pertinent records and property, as provided in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n2. If at any time the director has evidence that a grain warehouseman is insolvent or is unable to satisfy the claims of all depositors as they become due, or the warehouseman does not have in his inventory sufficient grain to cover the outstanding receipts and scale tickets issued or assumed by him, the director may modify, suspend or revoke the warehouseman's license or petition the circuit court in the county where the warehouse is located for an ex parte order authorizing the director or his authorized agent to seize and take title possession, as trustee, of any grain and grain-related assets in the warehouse or under the warehouseman's control, and of all pertinent records and property as provided for in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n3. Whenever the director shall modify, suspend or revoke any license, he shall prepare an order so providing which shall be signed by the director or some person designated by him, and the order shall state the reason or reasons for the modification, suspension or revocation of the license. The order shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee or applicant at the address of the grain warehouseman licensed or applying for a license. Within thirty days after the mailing of the order, the licensee, if aggrieved by the order of the director, may appeal as provided in chapter 536. At the time of the filing of the appeal, the party appealing shall give a bond for costs conditioned on his prosecuting the appeal without delay and paying all costs assessed against him. In addition, the licensee shall post a bond which shall remain in effect pending final disposition of all appeals, including review by the Missouri court of appeals or Missouri supreme court, or federal review, in an amount sufficient to cover all grain storage, and other grain-related obligations of the licensee as identified by the director. The posting of such bond is jurisdictional to the circuit court's authority to entertain the appeal.\n\n4. Upon receipt of the director's verified petition setting forth the circumstances of the warehouseman's failure to comply with this chapter and further stating reasons why immediate possession by the director or his authorized agent is necessary for the protection of depositors, warehouse receipt holders or sureties, the court is authorized to issue an ex parte order and shall issue such an order authorizing the director or his authorized agent to take immediate possession for the purposes stated in this section. A copy of the petition and order shall be sent to the warehouseman. If appropriate, the court may order the director's taking possession of only grain-related assets and not the entire business of the warehouseman. Such order may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The director locking down and securing, by padlocks or other appropriate means, the grain storage bins, scales, offices, equipment and rolling stock of the warehouseman;\n\n(2) Removing and excluding the warehouseman, or any and all of the warehouseman's employees, from the facility;\n\n(3) Prohibiting the warehouseman from engaging in any grain-related business transactions whatever during the director's possession of the grain-related assets of the warehouseman's business;\n\n(4) Authorizing all financial institutions to place all business accounts of the warehouseman under the director's authority and to freeze all transactions involving such accounts except to honor outstanding checks written previous to the issuance of the court's order. If it appears that the warehouseman has conducted, in part, his grain storage business through the use of personal accounts as opposed to business accounts, or intermingled two or more such accounts, the court may authorize the applicable financial institutions to place such personal accounts, as well as the business accounts, under the authority of the director in order to allow the director to accurately determine the extent of all grain-related obligations incurred by the warehouseman, the correct status of same and the warehouseman's resources to pay his grain-related obligations;\n\n(5) Authorizing the director to redeliver or sell depositor or company-owned grain, as appropriate in the circumstances and setting forth the conditions for doing such;\n\n(6) Authorizing the director to deposit all grain-related assets and proceeds therefrom in an interest-bearing escrow account to be disbursed only upon orders of the court;\n\n(7) Directing the warehouseman to furnish the director with all grain-related business documents which come into his possession subsequent to the director's possession of the grain-related assets, as well as any other grain-related documents which the warehouseman may have knowledge of and which are not at the warehouse facility.\n\n5. At any time within ten days after the director or his authorized agent takes possession, the warehouseman may file with the court a response to the petition of the director stating reasons why the director or his authorized agent should not be allowed to retain possession. The court shall set the matter for hearing on a date not more than fifteen days from the date of the filing of the warehouseman's response. The order placing the director or his authorized agent in possession shall not be stayed nor set aside until such time as the court, after hearing, determines that possession should be restored to the warehouseman.\n\n6. Upon taking possession, the director shall give written notice of his action to the surety on the bond of the warehouseman and may notify the holders of record, as shown by the warehouseman's records, of all receipts and tickets issued for grain to present their receipts or tickets for examination or to account for the same. The director may thereupon cause an audit and other investigation to be made of the affairs of the warehouse to determine the amount of the shortage and compute the shortage as to each depositor as shown by the warehouseman's records, if practicable. The director shall notify the warehouseman and the surety on his bond of the approximate amount of the shortage and may notify each depositor thereby affected by sending notice to the depositor's last known address as shown by the records of the warehouseman.\n\n7. The director or his authorized agent shall retain possession obtained under this section until such time as the warehouseman or the surety on the bond shall have satisfied the claims of all depositors, or until such time as the director or his authorized agent is ordered by the court to surrender possession. At no time while the director or his authorized agent is in possession of a warehouse, as authorized by this section, shall the director or his authorized agent be required to operate the warehouse; nor will the director or his authorized agent be liable for any claims which have arisen or could arise from the nonoperation of the warehouse.\n\n8. If at any time, the director, whether or not he or his authorized agent has possession as authorized by this section, has evidence that a warehouseman is insolvent or is unable to satisfy the claims of all depositors, the director may petition the circuit court for the appointment of a receiver to operate or liquidate the business of the warehouseman in accordance with law.\n\n9. All necessary expenses incurred by the director, his authorized agents or any receiver appointed under this section, in carrying out the provisions of this section may be recovered from the warehouseman in a separate civil action brought by the director in the circuit court or as part of the seizure or receivership action filed under this section. If the director or any of his authorized agents seize and take possession of the grain, records or property at the warehouse facility, the warehouseman shall be assessed and shall pay as part of the necessary expenses incurred a fee of fifty dollars per person for each day or part thereof that each such person performs such activities. The cost of liability insurance necessary to protect the director, the receiver and others engaged in carrying out the provisions of this section may be recovered as part of the necessary expenses.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 75 § 7, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1578, A.L. 1997 H.B. 211)\n\nEffective 4-02-97",

The owners of the grain shall sell to the warehouseman or remove, or cause to be removed, their grain from the warehouse or the obligations may be assumed by a successor warehouseman before the termination of the license.
