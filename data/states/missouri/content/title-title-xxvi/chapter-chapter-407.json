      "text": "Title XXVI TRADE AND COMMERCE\n\nChapter 407\n\n407.025. Civil action to recover damages — class actions authorized, when — procedure. —1. (1) Any person who purchases or leases merchandise primarily for personal, family or household purposes and thereby suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by section 407.020, may bring a private civil action in either the circuit court of the county in which the seller or lessor resides or in which the transaction complained of took place, to recover actual damages.\n\n(2) A person seeking to recover damages shall establish:\n\n(a) That the person acted as a reasonable consumer would in light of all circumstances;\n\n(b) That the method, act, or practice declared unlawful by section 407.020 would cause a reasonable person to enter into the transaction that resulted in damages; and\n\n(c) Individual damages with sufficiently definitive and objective evidence to allow the loss to be calculated with a reasonable degree of certainty.\n\n­­A court may dismiss a claim as a matter of law where the claim fails to show a likelihood that the method, act, or practice alleged to be unlawful would mislead a reasonable consumer.\n\n2. The court may, in its discretion:\n\n(1) Award punitive damages;\n\n(2) Award to the prevailing party attorney's fees, based on the amount of time reasonably expended; and\n\n(3) Provide such equitable relief as it deems necessary or proper to protect the prevailing party from the methods, acts, or practices declared unlawful by section 407.020.\n\n3. No action may be brought under this section to recover damages for personal injury or death in which a claim can be made under chapter 538.\n\n4. A cause of action under this section accrues on the date of purchase or lease described in subsection 1 of this section or upon receipt of notice of a method, act, or practice declared unlawful by section 407.020.\n\n5. Persons entitled to bring an action pursuant to subsection 1 of this section may, if the unlawful method, act or practice has caused similar injury to numerous other persons, institute an action as representative or representatives of a class against one or more defendants as representatives of a class, and the petition shall allege such facts as will show that these persons or the named defendants specifically named and served with process have been fairly chosen and adequately and fairly represent the whole class, to recover damages as provided for in subsection 1 of this section. The plaintiff shall be required to prove such allegations, unless all of the members of the class have entered their appearance, and it shall not be sufficient to prove such facts by the admission or admissions of the defendants who have entered their appearance. The class representative or representatives shall establish:\n\n(1) That the representative or representatives acted as a reasonable consumer would in light of all circumstances;\n\n(2) That the method, act, or practice declared unlawful by section 407.020 would cause a reasonable person to enter into the transaction that resulted in damages; and\n\n(3) Individual damages with sufficiently definitive and objective evidence to allow the loss to be calculated with a reasonable degree of certainty.\n\n­­All other members of the class shall establish individual damages in a manner determined by the court. In any action brought pursuant to this section, the court may in its discretion order, in addition to damages, injunction or other equitable relief and reasonable attorney's fees. Attorney's fees, if awarded, shall bear a reasonable relationship to the amount of the judgment. When the judgment grants equitable relief, the attorney's fees shall be based on the amount of time reasonably expended.\n\n6. An action may be maintained as a class action in a manner consistent with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Missouri rule of civil procedure 52.08 to the extent such state rule is not inconsistent with the federal rule if:\n\n(1) The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\n\n(2) There are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n\n(3) The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\n\n(4) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; and, in addition\n\n(5) The prosecution of separate action by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of:\n\n(a) Inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or\n\n(b) Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or\n\n(6) The party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or\n\n(7) The court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include:\n\n(a) The interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;\n\n(b) The extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class;\n\n(c) The desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum;\n\n(d) The difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.\n\n7. (1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order pursuant to this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\n\n(2) In any class action maintained pursuant to subdivision (7) of subsection 6 of this section, the court shall direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise each member that:\n\n(a) The court will exclude such member from the class if such member so requests by a specified date;\n\n(b) The judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion; and\n\n(c) Any member who does request exclusion may, if such member desires, enter an appearance through such member's counsel.\n\n(3) The judgment in an action maintained as a class action pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection 6 of this section or subdivision (6) of subsection 6 of this section, whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those whom the court finds to be members of the class. The judgment in an action maintained as a class action pursuant to subdivision (7) of subsection 6 of this section, whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those to whom the notice provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection was directed, and who have requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.\n\n(4) When appropriate an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this section shall then be construed and applied accordingly.\n\n8. In the conduct of actions to which this section applies, the court may make appropriate orders:\n\n(1) Determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument;\n\n(2) Requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action;\n\n(3) Imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors;\n\n(4) Requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly;\n\n(5) Dealing with similar procedural matters.\n\n9. A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.\n\n10. Upon commencement of any action brought pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall inform the clerk of the court in which such action is brought, on forms to be provided by such clerk, that the action is brought pursuant to this section. The clerk of the court shall forthwith inform the attorney general of the commencement of such action, together with a copy of the complaint or other initial pleading, and, upon entry of any judgment or decree in the action, the clerk shall mail a copy of such judgment or decree to the attorney general.\n\n11. Any permanent injunction, judgment or order of the court made pursuant to section 407.100 shall be prima facie evidence in an action brought pursuant to this section that the respondent used or employed a method, act or practice declared unlawful by section 407.020.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 55, A.L. 1985 H.B. 96, et al., A.L. 1999 S.B. 1, et al., A.L. 2000 H.B. 1509, A.L. 2020 S.B. 591)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nApplicability of statute changes for cases filed after August 28, 2020, 510.262\n\n(2001) Placing a bet at casino blackjack table is not a purchase within meaning of section.

The new owner of a health spa shall not consider the lapsed time period when determining how much time remains for service on any particular contract.\n\n2. It shall be a defense relieving the buyer from amounts then owing on any contract between a buyer and a health spa for health spa services, regardless of whether such contract has been assigned, that the health spa has gone out of business without providing alternative health spa services at another location within ten miles of the location designated in the health spa contract.\n\n3. Any health spa which relocates to a location that is ten miles from the location designated in a health spa contract or which goes out of business prior to the expiration of a buyer's contract without providing alternative health spa services at another location within ten miles of the location designated in the health spa contract shall be required to refund to the buyer funds paid or accepted in payment of the contract in an amount computed by dividing the contract price by the number of weeks in the contract term and multiplying the result by the number of weeks remaining in the contract term. This provision shall not apply to any health spa that has been sold provided there has not been a lapse in service for more than thirty days. However the new owner of a health spa shall honor the terms of all contracts entered into between buyers and the health spa while controlled by the prior owner. The new owner of the health spa shall not consider the lapsed period when determining how much time remains for service on any particular contract.\n\n4. In order to ensure adequate enforcement of the provisions of this section the office of the attorney general is empowered to represent buyers who may be injured as a result of noncompliance with the provisions of this section. The attorney general is hereby given in addition to the powers granted to the attorney general to enforce the provisions of this chapter the additional power to seek and be granted receivership of all goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, lands and tenements, books, records, documents, papers, choses in action, bills, notes, and property of every description of any person, firm, corporation, organization, club or association that has operated a health spa that is determined to have injured a buyer as a result of going out of business or being sold and failing to refund moneys due and owing buyers under the provisions of subsection 3 of this section, and to sell, convey, and assign the same and hold and dispose of the proceeds thereof under the direction of the court for the benefit of the injured buyers.\n\n(L. 1988 S.B. 486 § 5)",

The manufacturer shall immediately notify the consumer of a reasonably accessible repair facility of a franchised new farm machinery dealer to conform the new farm machinery to the express warranty. After delivery of the new farm machinery to an authorized repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall have thirty calendar days to conform the new farm machinery to the express warranty in appropriate seasonable use times, and sixty days in other times. The department of agriculture shall designate appropriate seasonal use times for all machinery covered by the provisions of sections 407.585 to 407.592. Upon notification from the consumer that the new farm machinery has not been conformed to the express warranty, the manufacturer shall inform the consumer if an informal dispute settlement procedure has been established by the manufacturer. However, if prior notice by the manufacturer of an informal dispute settlement procedure has been given, no further notice is required. In the event any repairs which may be required under any warranty takes more than fourteen working days to complete, then said manufacturer shall supply at no cost a like piece of farm machinery for use by the consumer if requested by the consumer during said time of repair. Any costs incurred by a dealer under the provisions of sections 407.585 to 407.592 shall be reimbursed to the dealer by the manufacturer.\n\n2. Any action brought under sections 407.585 to 407.592 shall be commenced within six months following expiration of the terms, conditions, or limitations of the express warranty, or within eighteen months following the date of original delivery of the new farm machinery to a consumer, whichever is earlier, or, in the event that a consumer resorts to an informal dispute settlement procedure as provided in sections 407.585 to 407.592, within ninety days following the final action of any panel established pursuant to such procedure. In the event an action is brought under the provisions of sections 407.585 to 407.592 the prevailing party shall be allowed to recover any court costs and reasonable attorneys fees.\n\n(L. 1987 H.B. 76 § 5)",

It is deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable to require a consumer to assume absolute liability for damage or loss up to the total value of a rental vehicle regardless of fault as a condition of the rental agreement, and then not include as part of any collision damage waiver product, a waiver of liability for any damage or loss which occurs as a result of the consumer's ordinary negligence, except where:\n\n(1) The damage is caused intentionally by an authorized driver or as a result of his willful and wanton misconduct;\n\n(2) The damage arises out of the authorized driver's operation of the vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of any illegal or unauthorized drug;\n\n(3) The rental transaction is based on fraudulent information supplied by the renter;\n\n(4) The damage arises out of the use of the vehicle while committing or otherwise engaged in a criminal act in which the automobile usage is substantially related to the nature of the criminal activity;\n\n(5) The damage arises out of the use of the vehicle to carry persons or property for hire;\n\n(6) The damage occurs while the vehicle is operated by a person other than an authorized driver as defined in section 407.730;\n\n(7) The damage arises out of the use of the vehicle outside of the United States unless such use is specifically authorized by the rental agreement;\n\n(8) Towing or pushing anything or if operation of the vehicle on an unpaved road has resulted in damage or loss which is a direct result of the road or driving conditions;\n\n(9) Loss due to the theft of the rental vehicle. However, the renter shall be presumed to have no liability for any loss due to theft if:\n\n(a) An authorized driver has possession of the ignition key furnished by the rental company or an authorized driver establishes that the ignition key furnished by the car rental company was not in the vehicle at the time of the theft; and\n\n(b) An authorized driver files an official report of the theft with the police or other law enforcement agency within twenty-four hours of learning of the theft and reasonably cooperates with the car rental company and the police or other law enforcement agency in providing information concerning the theft.\n\n­­The presumption set forth in this paragraph is a presumption affecting the burden of proof which the car rental company may rebut by establishing that an authorized driver committed, or aided and abetted the commission of, the theft.\n\n3. Any claim resulting from damage to or loss of a rental vehicle shall be reasonably and rationally related to the actual loss incurred. The car rental company shall not assert or collect any claim for physical or mechanical damage to or loss of a rental vehicle which exceeds: the actual cash value of the vehicle immediately before the loss less any proceeds from the vehicle's disposal after the loss, or the actual cost to repair the damaged vehicle including all discounts or price reductions, whichever is less. Such claim shall be based on an estimate of damage or repair invoice made by an independent appraisal company, an insurance company, or a repair facility that completed or would complete the repairs. A car rental company's charge for loss of use shall not exceed a reasonable estimate of the actual income lost.\n\n4. It is a deceptive and unfair practice for a car rental company or employee to knowingly and intentionally misrepresent any material element of a rental agreement transaction including the sale of collision damage waiver and car rental insurance. The company shall disclose in the rental agreement the extent of the consumer's liability for the vehicle and applicable mileage limitations and charges. When the consumer elects the collision damage waiver or car rental insurance, the price for collision damage waiver and car rental insurance shall appear on the rental agreement. A car rental company shall not require the purchase of collision damage waiver or car rental insurance. No car rental company shall sell to a consumer or offer to sell a consumer a collision damage waiver or car rental insurance as a part of the rental agreement unless the car rental company provides the consumer with the following written notice:\n\nCOLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER AND CAR RENTAL INSURANCE NOTICE: OUR CONTRACT OFFERS FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE COLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER AND CAR RENTAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO PURCHASE ANY OF THESE OPTIONAL PRODUCTS, YOU MAY WISH TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR CREDIT CARD PROVIDES YOU COVERAGE DURING THE RENTAL PERIOD. THE PURCHASE OF ANY OF THESE OPTIONAL PRODUCTS IS NOT REQUIRED TO RENT A VEHICLE.\n\n­­Such notice shall be made on the face of the rental agreement as part of the written contract and shall be set apart in boldface type and in no smaller print than ten-point type, and shall include a space for the consumer to acknowledge his receipt of this notice. This notice requirement shall be deemed satisfied if this written notice appears in materials furnished to a consumer during the enrollment process into a master rental agreement. This notice provision is deemed complied with for all consumers who have previously enrolled into a master rental agreement prior to August 28, 2004, and no further notice shall be required.\n\n5. The car rental company shall provide a notice at the rental office in the form of a sign, placard, or brochure that informs the consumer of the following:\n\n(1) The availability of collision damage waiver;\n\n(2) The availability of car rental insurance;\n\n(3) A statement that the purchase of collision damage waiver and/or car rental insurance is not required in order to rent.\n\n­­The following language may be used to comply with the requirements of this section, but shall not be considered the exclusive language that may be used:\n\n6. Car rental companies shall not place a hold against a consumer's credit limit or charge a consumer's credit card in a deceptive or unfair manner, and without full and complete disclosure of such practice.\n\n7. The remedies for any violation by a car rental company of any provision of sections 407.730 to 407.735, or for any conduct, act, or practice prescribed by any provisions of sections 407.730 to 407.735, shall be injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars for each violation. The aggregate amount of monetary damages which may be assessed against a car rental company for violations of any provisions of sections 407.730 to 407.735, or for any conduct, act, or practice prescribed by any provisions of sections 407.730 to 407.735, shall not exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars in the aggregate during any calendar year.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 893 § 3, A.L. 2003 S.B. 207, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1285 merged with S.B. 1233, et al.)",

When more than one complaint is filed with the administrative hearing commission, the administrative hearing commission may consolidate the applications into one proceeding to expedite the disposition of all relevant issues.\n\n7. Unless otherwise specifically required by another provision of the MVFP act, in all proceedings pursuant to sections 407.810 to 407.835, the franchisor shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it has acted in good faith, that all required notices were given, and that good cause exists for its actions.\n\n8. If a franchisee prevails in an action against a franchisor under any provision of sections 407.810 to 407.835, then the franchisee shall also have a cause of action against the franchisor for damages and reasonable expenses of litigation, including, but not limited to, depositions, transcripts, expert witnesses, and attorney fees.\n\n9. A franchisee may mail a demand for mediation to its franchisor at any time after it receives any notice from a franchisor as required by any provision of the MVFP act. In addition, prior to, contemporaneous with, or after the filing of a complaint with the administrative hearing commission, a franchisee may mail a demand for mediation to its franchisor for any violation by the franchisor of any provision of the MVFP act. The mailing of the demand for mediation is effective when mailed to the address shown on the notice from the franchisor, the address shown on the franchise agreement, the address of the franchisor shown on its license with the department of revenue, the address of the franchisor's registered agent in this state, or the address of its attorney in a proceeding pending at the administrative hearing commission concerning the subject of the demand for mediation. The demand for mediation shall contain a short statement of the dispute and the relief sought by the franchisee; however, the contents of the demand are not jurisdictional.\n\n10. The mailing of a demand for mediation stays any time period for the franchisee to initiate any action under the MVFP act that is the subject of the dispute described in the demand for mediation. If the parties fail to resolve the matter in dispute after meeting with the mediator, then the time period for filing any action with the administrative hearing commission shall start on the first business day after the date of the last date of any meeting with the mediator.\n\n11. If a proceeding is pending before the administrative hearing commission concerning the subject of the demand for mediation, the franchisee shall also file a copy of the demand for mediation with the administrative hearing commission. The filing of a copy of the demand for mediation with the administrative hearing commission shall stay any further action by the administrative hearing commission, other than the issuance of the order required of the administrative hearing commission under subsection 1 of this section informing the franchisor that it shall not proceed with the initiation of its activity or activities until the administrative hearing commission issues its final decision or order. If the matter is not resolved after the meeting with the mediator, then either party may inform the administrative hearing commission that the matter is not resolved and the administrative hearing commission shall issue its order terminating the stay of its proceeding.\n\n12. Within five business days after the date of receipt of the demand for mediation, the franchisor shall contact the franchisee or its legal representative reflected in the demand for mediation to exchange suggested lists of mediators. The parties shall mutually accept a mediator within two business days after the date of exchanging suggested lists of mediators. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, then the presiding judge in Cole County or in the circuit court for the county in which the franchisee does business shall appoint the mediator. Within twenty days after the receipt of the demand for mediation, the parties shall meet with the mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. The meeting shall take place in this state at a location designated by the mediator. The mediator may extend the date of the meeting upon the agreement of the parties or upon good cause shown by either party.\n\n13. The director of revenue shall require each franchisor to establish and maintain a panel of mediators who may serve as mediators for disputes that may arise in this state with its franchisees.\n\n(L. 1997 H.B. 516, A.L. 2001 H.B. 693, A.L. 2001 H.B. 575, A.L. 2010 H.B. 2198)",

Unlawful practices. —Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement to the contrary, the performance, whether by act or omission, by a motor vehicle franchisor, whether directly or indirectly through an agent, employee, affiliate, common entity, or representative, or through an entity controlled by a franchisor, of any or all of the following acts enumerated in this section are hereby defined as unlawful practices, the remedies for which are set forth in section 407.835:\n\n(1) To engage in any conduct which is capricious or not in good faith or unconscionable and which causes damage to a motor vehicle franchisee or to the public; provided, that good faith conduct engaged in by motor vehicle franchisors as sellers of new motor vehicles or parts or as holders of security interest therein, in pursuit of rights or remedies accorded to sellers of goods or to holders of security interests pursuant to the provisions of chapter 400, uniform commercial code, shall not constitute unfair practices pursuant to sections 407.810 to 407.835;\n\n(2) To coerce, attempt to coerce, require or attempt to require any motor vehicle franchisee to accept delivery of any new motor vehicle or vehicles, equipment, tools, parts or accessories therefor, or any other commodity or commodities which such motor vehicle franchisee has not ordered after such motor vehicle franchisee has rejected such commodity or commodities, or which is not required by law or the franchise agreement. It shall not be deemed a violation of this section for a motor vehicle franchisor to require a motor vehicle franchisee to have an inventory of parts, tools, and equipment reasonably necessary to service the motor vehicles sold by a motor vehicle franchisor; or new motor vehicles reasonably necessary to meet the demands of dealers or the public or to display to the public the full line of a motor vehicle franchisor's product line;\n\n(3) To withhold, reduce, delay, or refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of orders for new motor vehicles, such motor vehicles as are so ordered and as are covered by such franchise and as are specifically publicly advertised by such motor vehicle franchisor to be available for immediate delivery; provided, however, the failure to deliver any motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of sections 407.810 to 407.835 if such failure is due to an act of God, work stoppage, or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of products or materials, freight delays, embargo or other causes of which such motor vehicle franchisor shall have no control;\n\n(4) To coerce, attempt to coerce, require or attempt to require any motor vehicle franchisee to enter into any agreement with such motor vehicle franchisor or its agent, employee, affiliate, or representative, or a person controlled by the franchisor or to do any other act prejudicial to such motor vehicle franchisee;\n\n(5) To terminate, cancel, refuse to continue, or refuse to renew any franchise without good cause, unless such new motor vehicle franchisee, without good cause, substantially defaults in the performance of such franchisee's reasonable, lawful, and material obligations under such franchisee's franchise. In determining whether good cause exists, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\n(a) The amount of business transacted by the franchisee;\n\n(b) The investments necessarily made and obligations incurred by the franchisee, including but not limited to goodwill, in the performance of its duties under the franchise agreement, together with the duration and permanency of such investments and obligations;\n\n(c) The potential for harm and inconvenience to consumers as a result of disruption of the business of the franchisee;\n\n(d) The franchisee's failure to provide adequate service facilities, equipment, parts, and qualified service personnel;\n\n(e) The franchisee's failure to perform warranty work on behalf of the manufacturer, subject to reimbursement by the manufacturer;\n\n(f) The franchisee's failure to substantially comply, in good faith, with requirements of the franchise that are determined to be reasonable, lawful, and material;\n\n(g) The franchisor's failure to honor its requirements under the franchise;\n\n(h) The potential harm to the area that the franchisee serves;\n\n(i) The demographic and geographic characteristics of the area the franchisee serves; and\n\n(j) The harm to the franchisor;\n\n(6) To prevent by contract or otherwise, any motor vehicle franchisee from changing the capital structure of the franchisee's franchise or the means by or through which the franchisee finances the operation of the franchisee's franchise, provided the motor vehicle franchisee at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to between the motor vehicle franchisee and the motor vehicle franchisor and grants to the motor vehicle franchisor a purchase money security interest in the new motor vehicles, new parts and accessories purchased from the motor vehicle franchisor;\n\n(7) (a) To prevent, by contract or otherwise, any sale or transfer of a franchisee's franchise or interest or management thereof; provided, if the franchise specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any such proposed sale or transfer, a franchisor shall only be allowed to disapprove a proposed sale or transfer if the interest being sold or transferred when added to any other interest owned by the transferee constitutes fifty percent or more of the ownership interest in the franchise and if the proposed transferee fails to satisfy any standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the franchisor prior to its entering into a franchise, and which relate to the qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed transferee and which are reasonable. A franchisee or proposed franchisee may request, at any time, that the franchisor provide a copy of the standards which are normally relied upon by the franchisor to evaluate a proposed sale or transfer and a proposed transferee;\n\n(b) The franchisee and the prospective franchisee shall cooperate with the franchisor in providing information relating to the prospective transferee's qualifications, capitalization, integrity and character;\n\n(c) In the event of a proposed sale or transfer of a franchise, the franchisor shall be permitted to exercise a right of first refusal to acquire the franchisee's assets or ownership if:\n\na.

Such sale or transfer is conditioned upon the franchisor or franchisee entering a franchise agreement with the proposed transferee;\n\nc. The exercise of the right of first refusal shall result in the franchisee and the franchisee's owners receiving the same or greater consideration and the same terms and conditions as contracted to receive in connection with the proposed sale or transfer;\n\nd. The sale or transfer does not involve the sale or transfer to an immediate member or members of the family of one or more franchisee owners, defined as a spouse, child, grandchild, spouse of a child or grandchild, brother, sister or parent of the franchisee owner, or to the qualified manager, defined as an individual who has been employed by the franchisee for at least two years and who otherwise qualifies as a franchisee operator, or a partnership or corporation controlled by such persons; and\n\ne. The franchisor agrees to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees which do not exceed the usual, customary and reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients, incurred by the proposed transferee prior to the franchisor's exercise of its right of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the contract for the proposed sale or transfer of the franchise or the franchisee's assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment of such expenses and attorney's fees shall be required if the franchisee has not submitted or caused to be submitted an accounting of those expenses within fourteen days of the franchisee's receipt of the franchisor's written request for such an accounting. Such accounting may be requested by a franchisor before exercising its right of first refusal;\n\n(d) For determining whether good cause exists for the purposes of this subdivision, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\na. Whether the franchise agreement specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any proposed sale or transfer;\n\nb. Whether the interest to be sold or transferred when added to any other interest owned by the proposed transferee constitutes fifty percent or more of the ownership interest in the franchise;\n\nc. Whether the proposed transferee fails to satisfy the standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the franchisor prior to its entering into a franchise, and which related to the qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed transferee and which are lawful and reasonable;\n\nd. The amount of business transacted by the franchisee;\n\ne. The investments and obligations incurred by the franchisee, including but not limited to goodwill, in the performance of its duties under the franchise agreement, together with the duration and permanency of such investments and obligations;\n\nf. The investments and obligations that the proposed transferee is prepared to make in the business;\n\ng. The potential for harm and inconvenience to consumers as a result of the franchisor's decision;\n\nh. The franchisor's failure to honor its requirements under the franchise;\n\ni. The potential harm to the area that the franchisee serves;\n\nj. The ability or willingness of the franchisee to continue in the business if the proposed transfer is not permitted;\n\nk. The demographic and geographic characteristics of the area the franchisee serves; and\n\nl. The harm to the franchisor;\n\n(8) To prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle franchisee from changing the executive management of the motor vehicle franchisee's business, unless the motor vehicle franchisor demonstrates that such change in executive management will be detrimental to the distribution of the motor vehicle franchisor's motor vehicles;\n\n(9) To impose unreasonable standards of performance upon a motor vehicle franchisee or to require, attempt to require, coerce or attempt to coerce a franchisee to adhere to performance standards that are not applied uniformly to other similarly situated franchisees;\n\n(10) To require, attempt to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a motor vehicle franchisee at the time of entering into a franchise or any other arrangement to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by sections 407.810 to 407.835;\n\n(11) To prohibit directly or indirectly the right of free association among motor vehicle franchisees for any lawful purpose;\n\n(12) To provide any term or condition in any lease or other agreement ancillary or collateral to a franchise, including, but not limited to, any agreement with a common entity or any person required by the franchisor or controlled by or affiliated with the franchisor, which term or condition directly or indirectly violates the provisions of sections 407.810 to 407.835;\n\n(13) Upon any termination, cancellation, refusal to continue, or refusal to renew any franchise or any discontinuation of any line-make or parts or products related to such line-make, failing to pay reasonable compensation to a franchisee as follows:\n\n(a) The franchisee's net acquisition cost for any new, undamaged and unsold vehicle in the franchisee's inventory of either the current model year or one year-prior model year purchased from the franchisor or another franchisee of the same line-make in the ordinary course of business prior to receipt of a notice of termination or nonrenewal, provided the vehicle has less than seven hundred fifty miles registered on the odometer, including mileage incurred in delivery from the franchisor or in transporting the vehicle between dealers for sale;\n\n(b) The franchisee's cost of each new, unused, undamaged and unsold part or accessory if the part or accessory is in the current parts catalog, less applicable allowances. In the case of sheet metal, a comparable substitute for the original package may be used. Reconditioned or core parts shall be valued at their core value, the price listed in the current parts catalog or the amount paid for expedited return of core parts, whichever is higher. If the part or accessory was purchased by the franchisee from an outgoing authorized franchisee, the franchisor shall purchase the part or accessory for the price in the current parts catalog. In the case of parts or accessories which no longer appear in the current parts catalog, the franchisor shall purchase the parts or accessories for the price in the last version of the parts catalog in which the part or accessory appeared;\n\n(c) The fair market value of each undamaged sign owned by the franchisee which bears a trademark or trade name used or claimed by the franchisor if the sign was purchased from, or purchased at the request of, the franchisor. During the first seven years after its purchase, the fair market value of each sign shall be the franchisee's costs of purchasing the sign, less depreciation, using straight-line depreciation and a seven-year life of the asset;\n\n(d) The fair market value of all equipment, tools, data processing programs and equipment and automotive service equipment owned by the franchisee which were recommended in writing and designated as equipment, tools, data processing programs and equipment, and automotive service equipment and purchased from, or purchased at the request of, the franchisor, if the equipment, tools, programs and equipment are in usable and good condition, except for reasonable wear and tear. During the first seven years after their purchase, the fair market value of each item of equipment, tools, and automotive service equipment shall be the franchisee's costs of purchasing the item, less depreciation, using straight-line depreciation and a seven-year life of the asset. During the first three years after its purchase, the fair market value of each item of required data processing programs and equipment shall be the franchisee's cost of purchasing the item, less depreciation, using straight-line depreciation and a three-year life of the asset;\n\n(e) In addition to the costs referenced in paragraphs (a) to (d) of this subdivision, the franchisor shall pay the franchisee an additional five percent for handling, packing, storing and loading of any property subject to repurchase pursuant to this section, and the franchisor shall pay the shipper for shipping the property subject to repurchase from the location of the franchisee to the location directed by the franchisor;\n\n(f) The amount remaining to be paid on any equipment or service contracts required by or leased from the franchisor or a subsidiary or company affiliated with or controlled or recommended by the franchisor. However, if the franchise agreement is voluntarily terminated by the franchisee, without coercion by the franchisor, then:\n\na. If the amount remaining to be paid on any equipment or service contract is owed to the franchisor, the franchisor shall cancel the obligation rather than paying the amount to the franchisee; and\n\nb. If the amount remaining to be paid on any equipment or service contract is owed to a subsidiary or a company affiliated with or controlled or recommended by the franchisor, the franchisor may pay such amount to the subsidiary or the company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor, but if the franchisor does not pay such amount to the subsidiary or the company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor, such amount may be paid to the franchisee by the subsidiary or company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor;\n\n(g) If the dealer leases the dealership facilities, then the franchisor shall be liable for twelve months' payment of the gross rent or the remainder of the term of the lease, whichever is less. If the dealership facilities are not leased, then the franchisor shall be liable for the equivalent of twelve months' payment of gross rent. This paragraph shall not apply when the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewed line was under good cause related to a conviction and imprisonment for a felony involving moral turpitude that is substantially related to the qualifications, function, or duties of a franchisee as well as fraud and voluntary terminations of a franchise. Gross rent is the monthly rent plus the monthly cost of insurance and taxes. Such reasonable rent shall be paid only to the extent that the dealership premises are recognized in the franchise and only if they are used solely for performance in accordance with the franchise and not substantially in excess of those facilities recommended by the manufacturer or distributor. If the facility is used for the operations of more than one franchise, the gross rent compensation shall be adjusted based on the planning volume and facility requirements of the manufacturers, distributors, or branch or division thereof;\n\n(h) The franchisor shall pay to the franchisee the amount remaining to be paid on any leases of computer hardware or software that is used to manage and report data to the manufacturer or distributor for financial reporting requirements and the amount remaining to be paid on any manufacturer or distributor required equipment leases, service contracts, and sign leases. The franchisor's obligation shall not exceed one year on any such lease. However, if the franchise agreement is voluntarily terminated by the franchisee, without coercion by the franchisor, then:\n\na. If the amount remaining to be paid is owed to the franchisor, the franchisor shall cancel the obligation rather than paying the amount to the franchisee; and\n\nb. If the amount remaining to be paid is owed to a subsidiary or a company affiliated with or controlled or recommended by the franchisor, the franchisor may pay such amount to the subsidiary or the company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor, subject to the limit of the franchisor's one-year obligation, but if the franchisor does not pay such amount to the subsidiary or the company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor, such amount may be paid to the franchisee by the subsidiary or company affiliated with or controlled by the franchisor, subject to the limit of the franchisor's one-year obligation;\n\n(i) In addition to the other payments set forth in this section, if a termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is premised upon the franchisor discontinuing the sale in this state of a line-make that was the subject of the franchise, then the franchisor shall also be liable to the franchisee for an amount at least equivalent to the fair market value of the franchisee's goodwill for the discontinued line-makes of the motor vehicle franchise on the date immediately preceding the date the franchisor announces the action which results in termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, whichever amount is higher. At the franchisee's option, the franchisor may avoid paying fair market value of the motor vehicle franchise to the franchisee under this paragraph if the franchisor, or another motor vehicle franchisor under an agreement with the franchisor, offers the franchisee a replacement motor vehicle franchise with terms substantially similar to that offered to other same line-make dealers;\n\n(j) The franchisor shall pay the franchisee all amounts incurred by the franchisee to upgrade its facilities that were required by the franchisor within twelve months prior to receipt of a notice of termination or nonrenewal; however, a franchisee shall not receive any benefits under this subdivision if it was terminated for the grounds set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection 4 of section 407.822. However, if the franchise agreement is voluntarily terminated by the franchisee, without coercion by the franchisor, and for a reason other than the death or incapacitation of the dealer principal, then the franchisor shall have no obligation under this paragraph;\n\n(k) The franchisor shall pay the franchisee the amounts specified in this subdivision along with any other amounts that may be due to the franchisee under the franchise agreement within sixty days after the tender of the property subject to the franchisee providing evidence of good and clear title upon return of the property to the franchisor. The franchisor shall remove the property within sixty days after the tender of the property from the franchisee's property. Unless previous arrangements have been made and agreed upon, the franchisee is under no obligation to provide insurance for the property left after sixty days;\n\n(l) This subdivision shall not apply to a termination, cancellation or nonrenewal due to a sale of the assets or stock of the motor vehicle dealership;\n\n(14) To prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a franchise or franchises by any legal heir or devisee under the will of a franchisee, under any written instrument filed with the franchisor designating any person as the person's successor franchisee, or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution of this state; provided:\n\n(a) Any designated family member of a deceased or incapacitated franchisee shall become the succeeding franchisee of such deceased or incapacitated franchisee if such designated family member gives the franchisor written notice of such family member's intention to succeed to the franchise or franchises within one hundred twenty days after the death or incapacity of the franchisee, and agrees to be bound by all of the lawful terms and conditions of the current franchise agreement, and the designated family member meets the current lawful and reasonable criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees. In order for the franchisor to claim that any such reasonable criteria are generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees, it shall have previously provided a copy to the proposed successor franchisee within ten days after receiving the proposed successor franchisee's notice. A franchisee may request, at any time, that the franchisor provide a copy of such criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees;\n\n(b) The franchisor may request from a designated family member such personal and financial data as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the existing franchise agreement should be honored. The designated family member shall supply the personal and financial data promptly upon the request;\n\n(c) If the designated family member does not meet the reasonable and lawful criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees, the discontinuance of the current franchise agreement shall take effect not less than ninety days after the date the franchisor serves the required notice on the designated family member pursuant to subsection 4 of section 407.822;\n\n(d) The provisions of this subdivision shall not preclude a franchisee from designating any person as the person's successor by written instrument filed with the franchisor, and if such an instrument is filed, it alone shall determine the succession rights to the management and operation of the franchise; and\n\n(e) For determining whether good cause exists, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration all circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\na. Whether the franchise agreement specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any successor;\n\nb. Whether the proposed successor substantially fails to satisfy the material standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the franchisor prior to the successor entering into a franchise, and which relate to the proposed management or ownership of the franchise operation or to the qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed successor and which are lawful and reasonable;\n\nc. The amount of the business transacted by the franchisee;\n\nd. The investments in and the obligations incurred by the franchisee, including but not limited to goodwill in the performance of its duties under the franchise agreement, together with the duration and permanency of such investments and obligations;\n\ne. The investments and obligations that the proposed successor franchisee is prepared to make in the business;\n\nf. The potential for harm and inconvenience to consumers as a result of the franchisor's decision;\n\ng. The franchisor's failure to honor its requirements under the franchise;\n\nh. The potential harm and injury to the public welfare in the area that the franchisee serves;\n\ni. The ability or willingness of the franchisee to continue in the business if the proposed transfer is not permitted;\n\nj. The demographic and geographic characteristics of the area the franchisee serves; and\n\nk. The harm to the franchisor;\n\n(15) To coerce, attempt to coerce, require, or attempt to require a franchisee under any condition affecting or related to a franchise agreement, to waive, limit or disclaim a right that the franchisee may have pursuant to the provisions of sections 407.810 to 407.835. Any contracts or agreements which contain such provisions shall be deemed against the public policy of the state of Missouri and are void and unenforceable. Nothing in this section shall prohibit voluntary settlement agreements that specifically identify the provisions of sections 407.810 to 407.835 that the franchisee is waiving, limiting, or disclaiming;\n\n(16) To initiate any act enumerated in this section on grounds that it has advised a franchisee of its intention to discontinue representation at the time of a franchisee change or require any franchisee to enter into a site control agreement as a condition to initiating any act enumerated in this section. Such condition shall not be construed to nullify an existing site control agreement for a franchisee's property;\n\n(17) To require, attempt to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any franchisee in this state to refrain from, or to terminate, cancel, or refuse to continue any franchise based upon participation by the franchisee in the management of, investment in or the acquisition of a franchise for the sale of any other line of new vehicle or related products in the same or separate facilities as those of the franchisor. This subdivision does not apply unless the franchisee maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new vehicle, the franchisee remains in compliance with the franchise and any reasonable facilities requirements of the franchisor, and no change is made in the principal management of the franchisee. The reasonable facilities requirement shall not include any requirement that a franchisee establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space, when such requirements would not otherwise be justified by reasonable business considerations. Before the addition of a line-make to the dealership facilities the franchisee shall first request consent of the franchisor, if required by the franchise agreement. Any decision of the franchisor with regard to dualing of two or more franchises shall be granted or denied within sixty days of a written request from the franchisee.

A franchisor may impose reasonable requirements on the franchisee including, but not limited to, the purchase of reasonable quantities of advertising materials, the purchase of special tools required to properly service a motor vehicle, the undertaking of sales person or service person training related to the motor vehicle, the meeting of reasonable display and facility requirements as a condition of receiving a motor vehicle, or other reasonable requirements; provided, that if a franchisor requires a franchisee to purchase essential service tools with a purchase price in the aggregate of more than seventy-five hundred dollars in order to receive a particular model of new motor vehicle, the franchisor shall upon written request provide such franchisee with a good faith estimate in writing of the number of vehicles of that particular model that the franchisee will be allocated during that model year in which the tools are required to be purchased;\n\n(19) To directly or indirectly condition the awarding of a franchise to a prospective franchisee, the addition of a line-make or franchise to an existing franchisee, the renewal of a franchise of an existing franchisee, the approval of the relocation of an existing franchisee's facility, or the approval of the sale or transfer of the ownership of a franchise on the willingness of a franchisee, proposed franchisee, or owner of an interest in the dealership facility to enter into a site control agreement or exclusive use agreement.

Thereafter, the franchisee shall have one hundred twenty days to cure the asserted grounds for termination, provided the grounds are both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship. If the franchisee fails to cure the asserted grounds for termination by the end of the cure period, then the franchisor may give the sixty-day notice required by subsection 4 of section 407.822 if it intends to terminate the franchise;\n\n(21) To require, attempt to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a franchisee, by franchise agreement or otherwise, or as a condition to the renewal or continuation of a franchise agreement, to:\n\n(a) Exclude from the use of the franchisee's facilities a line-make for which the franchisee has a franchise agreement to utilize the facilities;

to charge back or withhold payments or other things of value for which the franchisee is otherwise eligible under a sales promotion, program, or contest; to prevent a franchisee from participating in any promotion, program, or contest; or to take or threaten to take any adverse action against a franchisee, including charge-backs, reducing vehicle allocations, or terminating or threatening to terminate a franchise because the franchisee sold or leased a motor vehicle to a customer who exported the vehicle to a foreign country or who resold the vehicle, unless the franchisor proves that the franchisee knew or reasonably should have known that the customer intended to export or resell the motor vehicle. There is a rebuttable presumption that the franchisee neither knew nor reasonably should have known of its customer's intent to export or resell the vehicle if the vehicle is titled or registered in any state in this country. A franchisor may not take any action against a franchisee, including reducing its allocations or supply of motor vehicles to the franchisee, or charging back a franchisee for an incentive payment previously paid, unless the franchisor first meets in person, by telephone, or video conference with an officer or other designated employee of the franchisee. At such meeting, the franchisor shall provide a detailed explanation, with supporting documentation, as to the basis for its claim that the franchisee knew or reasonably should have known of the customer's intent to export or resell the motor vehicle. Thereafter, the franchisee shall have a reasonable period, commensurate with the number of motor vehicles at issue, but not less than fifteen days, to respond to the franchisor's claims. If, following the franchisee's response and completion of all internal dispute resolution processes provided through the franchisor, the dispute remains unresolved, the franchisee may file a complaint with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days after receipt of a written notice from the franchisor that it still intends to take adverse action against the franchisee with respect to the motor vehicles still at issue. If a complaint is timely filed, the administrative hearing commission shall notify the franchisor of the filing of the complaint, and the franchisor shall not take any action adverse to the franchisee until the administrative hearing commission renders a final determination, which is not subject to further appeal, that the franchisor's proposed action is in compliance with the provisions of this subdivision. In any hearing under this subdivision, the franchisor has the burden of proof on all issues raised by this subdivision;\n\n(38) To require a franchisee to provide its customer lists or service files to the franchisor, unless necessary for the sale and delivery of a new motor vehicle to a consumer, to validate and pay consumer or dealer incentives, for reasonable marketing purposes or for the submission to the franchisor for any services supplied by the franchisee for any claim for warranty parts or repairs. Nothing in this section shall limit the franchisor's ability to require or use customer information to satisfy any safety or recall notice obligation;\n\n(39) To mandate the use by the franchisee, or condition access to any services offered by the franchisor on the franchisee's use, or condition the acceptance of an order of any product or service offered by the franchisor on the franchisee's use, or condition the acceptance of any claim for payment from the franchisee on the franchisee's use, or condition the franchisee's participation in any program offered by the franchisor, a common entity or an entity controlled by the franchisor on the franchisee's use of any form, equipment, part, tool, furniture, fixture, data processing program or equipment, automotive service equipment, or sign from the franchisor, a vendor recommended by the franchisor, a common entity or an entity controlled by the franchisor if the franchisee is able to obtain the identical or reasonably equivalent product from another vendor;\n\n(40) Establishing any performance standard or program for measuring franchisee performance that may have a material impact on a franchisee that is not fair, reasonable, and equitable, or applying any such standard or program to a franchisee in a manner that is not fair, reasonable, and equitable. Within ten days of a request of a franchisee, a franchisor shall disclose in writing to the franchisee a description of how a performance standard or program is designed and all relevant information used in the application of the performance standard or program to that franchisee unless the information is available to the franchisee on the franchisor's website;\n\n(41) Establishing or implementing a plan or system for the allocation, scheduling, or delivery of new motor vehicles, parts, or accessories to its franchisees that is not fair, reasonable, and equitable or modifying an existing plan or system so as to cause the plan or system to be unreasonable, unfair, or inequitable. Within ten days of any request of a franchisee, the franchisor shall disclose in writing to the franchisee the method and mode of distribution of that line-make among the franchisor's franchisees of the same line-make within the same metro area for franchisees located in a metropolitan area and within the county and contiguous counties of any franchisee not located in a metropolitan area; and\n\n(42) To violate any other provision of the MVFP act that adversely impacts a franchisee.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1600 § 4, A.L. 1997 H.B. 516, A.L. 2001 H.B. 575, A.L. 2010 H.B. 2198, A.L. 2017 S.B. 329, A.L. 2019 H.B. 959)\n\n(1985) The \"substantial default\" of a franchisee's \"reasonable and lawful obligations\" could not be proven where franchisor could show no adverse impact on his business and where an exclusive space use requirement of franchise agreement was unreasonable in light of the fact that franchisor could not supply enough vehicles to utilize available space.

Franchisor's duties to franchisee — schedule of compensation — claims payment — retail rate calculation — audit authority — complaint procedure. —1. Notwithstanding any provision in a franchise to the contrary, each franchisor shall specify in writing to each of its franchisees in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty service on its products. The franchisor shall fairly and reasonably compensate the franchisee for preparation, delivery, and warranty service required of the franchisee by the franchisor. The franchisor shall provide the franchisee with the schedule of compensation to be paid to the franchisee for parts, labor, and service, and the time allowance for the performance of the labor and service for the franchisee's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty service.\n\n2. The schedule of compensation shall include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service and labor for the franchisee to meet its obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty service. The schedule shall also include reasonable and adequate time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of preparation, delivery, and warranty service to be performed in a careful and professional manner. In the determination of what constitutes reasonable compensation for labor and service pursuant to this section, the principal factor to be given consideration shall be the prevailing wage rates being charged for similar labor and service by the franchisee for similar labor and service to retail customers for nonwarranty labor and service. The primary factor in determining reasonable compensation for parts under this section shall be the amount charged by the franchisee for similar parts to retail customers for nonwarranty parts.\n\n3. A franchisor shall perform all warranty obligations, including recall notices; include in written notices of franchisor recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects; and compensate any of the franchisees in this state for repairs required by the recall. Compensation for parts and labor for recall repairs shall be determined under subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. No franchisor shall require a franchisee to submit a claim authorized under this section sooner than thirty days after the franchisee completes the preparation, delivery, or warranty service authorizing the claim for preparation, delivery, or warranty service. All claims made by a franchisee under this section shall be paid within thirty days after their approval. All claims shall be either approved or disapproved by the franchisor within thirty days after their receipt on a proper form generally used by the franchisor and containing the usually required information therein. Any claims not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after the receipt of the form shall be considered to be approved and payment shall be made within fifteen days thereafter. A franchisee shall not be required to maintain defective parts for more than thirty days after submission of a claim.\n\n5. A franchisor shall compensate the franchisee for franchisor-sponsored sales or service promotion events, including but not limited to, rebates, programs, or activities in accordance with established written guidelines for such events, programs, or activities, which guidelines shall be provided to each franchisee.\n\n6. No franchisor shall require a franchisee to submit a claim authorized under subsection 5 of this section sooner than thirty days after the franchisee becomes eligible to submit the claim. All claims made by a franchisee pursuant to subsection 5 of this section for promotion events, including but not limited to rebates, programs, or activities shall be paid within ten days after their approval. All claims shall be either approved or disapproved by the franchisor within thirty days after their receipt on a proper form generally used by the franchisor and containing the usually required information therein. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after the receipt of this form shall be considered to be approved and payment shall be made within fifteen days.\n\n7. In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the franchisee for parts, service, and labor, the following work shall not be included in the calculation:\n\n(1) Repairs for franchisor, manufacturer, or distributor special events, specials, or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs;\n\n(2) Parts sold at wholesale;\n\n(3) Engine assemblies and transmission assemblies;\n\n(4) Routine maintenance not covered under any retail customer warranty, such as fluids, filters, and belts not provided in the course of repairs;\n\n(5) Nuts, bolts, fasteners, and similar items that do not have an individual part number;\n\n(6) Tires; and\n\n(7) Vehicle reconditioning.\n\n8. If a franchisor, manufacturer, importer, or distributor furnishes a part or component to a franchisee, at no cost, to use in performing repairs under a recall, campaign service action, or warranty repair, the franchisor shall compensate the franchisee for the part or component in the same manner as warranty parts compensation under this section by compensating the franchisee at the average markup on the cost for the part or component as listed in the price schedule of the franchisor, manufacturer, importer, or distributor, less the cost for the part or component. This subsection shall not apply to entire engine assemblies, propulsion engine assemblies, including electric vehicle batteries, or entire transmission assemblies.\n\n9. A franchisor shall not require a franchisee to establish the retail rate customarily charged by the franchisee for parts, service, or labor by an unduly burdensome or time-consuming method or by requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. A franchisee shall not request a franchisor to approve a different labor rate or parts rate more than twice in one calendar year.\n\n10. If a franchisee submits any claim under this section to a franchisor that is incomplete, inaccurate, or lacking any information usually required by the franchisor, then the franchisor shall promptly notify the franchisee, and the time limit to submit the claim shall be extended for a reasonable length of time, not less than five business days following notice by the franchisor to the franchisee, for the franchisee to provide the complete, accurate, or lacking information to the franchisor.\n\n11. (1) A franchisor may only audit warranty, sales, or incentive claims and charge-back to the franchisee unsubstantiated claims for a period of twelve months following payment, subject to all of the provisions of this section. Furthermore, if the franchisor has good cause to believe that a franchisee has submitted fraudulent claims, then the franchisor may only audit suspected fraudulent warranty, sales, or incentive claims and charge-back to the franchisee fraudulent claims for a period of two years following payment, subject to all provisions of this section.\n\n(2) A franchisor shall not require documentation for warranty, sales, or incentive claims more than twelve months after the claim was paid.\n\n(3) Prior to requiring any charge-back, reimbursement, or credit against a future transaction arising out of an audit, the franchisor shall submit written notice to the franchisee along with a copy of its audit and the detailed reason for each intended charge-back, reimbursement, or credit.\n\n12. A franchisee may file a complaint with the administrative hearing commission pursuant to section 407.822 within sixty days after receipt of any written notice by a franchisor of any adverse decision on any claim for reimbursement submitted pursuant to this section, including, but not limited to, specific claims for reimbursement in individual warranty repair transactions, and requests for an increase in labor or parts rate. If a complaint is filed within the sixty days, then the denial or reduction of reimbursement, denial of a request for an increase in labor or parts rate, charge-back, or other determination by a franchisor which is adverse to a franchisee shall be stayed pending a hearing and determination of the matter under section 407.822. The franchisor shall file an answer to the complaint within thirty days after service of the complaint. If, following a hearing which shall be held within sixty days following service of the franchisor's answer, the administrative hearing commission determines that a franchisor has violated any requirements of this section, then the denial or reduction of reimbursement, denial of a request for an increase in labor or parts rate, or charge-back shall be void and the franchisor shall, within fifteen days of the commission's order, fairly compensate the franchisee as required by the provisions of this section. Section 407.835 shall apply to proceedings pursuant to this section.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 575, A.L. 2010 H.B. 2198, A.L. 2023 S.B. 398)",

The franchisor's notice of disapproval shall also specify the reasonable standard which the franchisor contends is not satisfied and the reason the franchisor contends such standard is not satisfied.

It shall not be deemed a violation of sections 407.1025 to 407.1049 for a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor to require a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee to have an inventory of parts, tools and equipment reasonably necessary to service the motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles sold by a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor; or new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles reasonably necessary to meet the demands of dealers or the public;\n\n(3) To unreasonably refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of orders for new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles, such motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles as are so ordered and as are covered by such franchise and as are specifically publicly advertised by such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor to be available for immediate delivery; provided, however, the failure to deliver any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle shall not be considered a violation of sections 407.1025 to 407.1049 if such failure is due to an act of God, work stoppage, or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of products or materials, freight delays, embargo or other cause of which such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor has no control;\n\n(4) To coerce any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee to enter into any agreement with such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor or to do any other act prejudicial to such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee, by threatening to cancel any franchise or any contractual agreement existing between such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor and motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee; provided, however, that notice in good faith to any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee of such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee's violation of any provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement shall not constitute a violation of sections 407.1025 to 407.1049;\n\n(5) To terminate, cancel or refuse to continue any franchise, directly or indirectly through the actions of the franchisor, unless such new motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee substantially defaults in the performance of such franchisee's reasonable and lawful obligations under such franchisee's franchise, or such new motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor discontinues the sale in the state of Missouri of such franchisor's products which are the subject of the franchise:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement to the contrary, good cause to terminate, cancel or refuse to continue any franchise agreement shall not be established based upon the fact that the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee owns, has an investment in, participates in the management of or holds a franchise agreement for the sale or service of another make or line of new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles or the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle dealer has established another make or line of new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities as those of the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor prior to February 1, 1998, or such establishment is approved in writing by the franchisee and the franchisor. However, a franchisor may require a franchisee to maintain a reasonable line of credit for each franchise and to comply with each franchisor's reasonable requirements concerning capital, management and facilities. If the franchise agreement requires the approval of the franchisor, such approval shall be requested in writing by the franchisee and the franchisor shall approve or disapprove such a request in writing within sixty days of receipt of such request. A request from a franchisee shall be deemed to have been approved if the franchisor fails to notify the franchisee, in writing, of its disapproval within sixty days after its receipt of the written request;\n\n(b) In determining whether good cause exists, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\na. The franchisee's sales in relation to sales in the market;\n\nb. The franchisee's investment and obligations;\n\nc. Injury to the public welfare;\n\nd. The adequacy of the franchisee's service facilities, equipment, parts and personnel in relation to those of other franchisees of the same line-make;\n\ne. Whether warranties are being honored by the franchisee;\n\nf. The parties' compliance with their franchise agreement;\n\ng. The desire of a franchisor for market penetration or a market study, if any, prepared by the franchisor or franchisee are two factors which may be considered;\n\nh.

A franchisee may request, at any time, that the franchisor provide a copy of the standards which are normally relied upon by the franchisor to evaluate a proposed sale or transfer and a proposed transferee;\n\n(b) The franchisee and the prospective franchisee shall cooperate fully with the franchisor in providing information relating to the prospective transferee's qualifications, capitalization, integrity and character;\n\n(c) In the event of a proposed sale or transfer of a franchise, the franchisor shall be permitted to exercise a right of first refusal to acquire the franchisee's assets or ownership if:\n\na. The franchise agreement permits the franchisor to exercise a right of first refusal to acquire the franchisee's assets or ownership in the event of a proposed sale or transfer;\n\nb. Such sale or transfer is conditioned upon the franchisor or franchisee entering a franchise agreement with the proposed transferee;\n\nc. The exercise of the right of first refusal shall result in the franchisee and the franchisee's owners receiving the same or greater consideration and the same terms and conditions as contracted to receive in connection with the proposed sale or transfer;\n\nd. The sale or transfer does not involve the sale or transfer to an immediate member or members of the family of one or more franchisee owners, defined as a spouse, child, grandchild, spouse of a child or grandchild, brother, sister or parent of the franchisee owner, or to the qualified manager, defined as an individual who has been employed by the franchisee for at least two years and who otherwise qualifies as a franchisee operator, or a partnership or corporation controlled by such persons; and\n\ne. The franchisor agrees to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees which do not exceed the usual, customary and reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients, incurred by the proposed transferee prior to the franchisor's exercise of its right of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the contract for the proposed sale or transfer of the franchise or the franchisee's assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment of such expenses and attorney's fees shall be required if the franchisee has not submitted or caused to be submitted an accounting of those expenses within fourteen days of the franchisee's receipt of the franchisor's written request for such an accounting. Such accounting may be requested by a franchisor before exercising its right of first refusal;\n\n(d) For determining whether good cause exists for the purposes of this subdivision, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\na. Whether the franchise agreement specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any proposed sale or transfer;\n\nb. Whether the interest to be sold or transferred when added to any other interest owned by the proposed transferee constitutes fifty percent or more of the ownership interest in the franchise;\n\nc. Whether the proposed transferee fails to satisfy any standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the franchisor prior to its entering into a franchise, and which are related to the proposed management or ownership of the franchise operations or to the qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed transferee which are reasonable;\n\nd. Injury to the public welfare;\n\ne. The harm to the franchisor;\n\n(8) To prevent by contract or otherwise any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee from changing the executive management of motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee's business, except that any attempt by a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor to demonstrate by giving reasons that such change in executive management will be detrimental to the distribution of the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor's motorcycles shall not constitute a violation of this subdivision;\n\n(9) To impose unreasonable standards of performance upon a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee;\n\n(10) To require a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee at the time of entering into a franchise arrangement to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by sections 407.1025 to 407.1049;\n\n(11) To prohibit directly or indirectly the right of free association among motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisees for any lawful purpose;\n\n(12) To provide any term or condition in any lease or other agreement ancillary or collateral to a franchise, which term or condition directly or indirectly violates the provisions of sections 407.1025 to 407.1049;\n\n(13) To fail to repurchase a franchisee's inventory and other items as set forth in this subdivision if a motorcycle or all-terrain franchise agreement is terminated, cancelled, or not renewed by the manufacturer for cause; if the dealer voluntarily terminates a motorcycle or all-terrain dealer agreement in a manner permitted by such agreement; if the manufacturer terminates or discontinues a franchise by discontinuing a line-make or by ceasing to do business in this state; or if the manufacturer changes the distributor or method of distribution of its products in this state or alters its sales regions or marketing areas within this state in a manner that eliminates or diminishes the dealer's market area. In such circumstances the manufacturer shall, at the election of the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle dealer, within thirty days of termination, repurchase:\n\n(a) Any new, undamaged and unsold motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles in the franchisee's inventory of either the current model year or purchased from the franchisor within one hundred twenty days prior to receipt of a notice of termination or nonrenewal, provided the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle has less than twenty miles registered on the odometer, including mileage incurred in delivery from the franchisor or in transporting the motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle between dealers for sale, at the dealer's net acquisition cost;\n\n(b) The current parts catalog cost to the dealer of each new, unused, undamaged and unsold part or accessory if the part or accessory is in the current parts catalog, less applicable allowances. If the part or accessory was purchased by the franchisee from an outgoing authorized franchisee, the franchisor shall purchase the part for either the price in the current parts catalog or the franchisee's actual purchase price of the part, whichever is less;\n\n(c) The depreciated value determined pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles of each undamaged sign owned by the franchisee which bears a trademark or trade name used or claimed by the franchisor if the sign was purchased from, or purchased at the request of, the franchisor;\n\n(d) The fair market value of all special tools, data processing equipment and motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle service equipment owned by the franchisee which were recommended in writing and designated as special tools and equipment and purchased from, or purchased at the request of, the franchisor within three years of the termination of the franchise, if the tools and equipment are in usable and good condition, except for reasonable wear and tear; and\n\n(e) The franchisor shall pay the franchisee the amounts specified in this subdivision within ninety days after the tender of the property subject to the franchisee providing evidence of good and clear title upon return of the property to the franchisor. Unless previous arrangements have been made and agreed upon, the franchisee is under no obligation to provide insurance for the property left after one hundred eighty days;\n\n(14) To prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a franchise or franchises by any legal heir or devisee under the will of a franchisee, under any written instrument filed with the franchisor designating any person as the person's successor franchisee, or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution of this state; provided:\n\n(a) Any designated family member of a deceased or incapacitated franchisee shall become the succeeding franchisee of such deceased or incapacitated franchisee if such designated family member gives the franchisor written notice of such family member's intention to succeed to the franchise or franchises within forty-five days after the death or incapacity of the franchisee, and agrees to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the current franchise agreement, and the designated family member meets the current reasonable criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees. A franchisee may request, at any time, that the franchisor provide a copy of such criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees;\n\n(b) The franchisor may request from a designated family member such personal and financial data as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the existing franchise agreement should be honored. The designated family member shall supply the personal and financial data promptly upon the request;\n\n(c) If the designated family member does not meet the reasonable criteria generally applied by the franchisor in qualifying franchisees, the discontinuance of the current franchise agreement shall take effect not less than ninety days after the date the franchisor serves the required notice on the designated family member pursuant to subsection 5 of section 407.1031;\n\n(d) The provisions of this subdivision shall not preclude a franchisee from designating any person as the person's successor by written instrument filed with the franchisor, and if such an instrument is filed, it alone shall determine the succession rights to the management and operation of the franchise; and\n\n(e) For determining whether good cause exists, the administrative hearing commission shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\na. Whether the franchise agreement specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any successor;\n\nb. Whether the proposed successor fails to satisfy any standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the franchisor prior to the successor entering into a franchise, and which relate to the proposed management or ownership of the franchise operation or to the qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed successor and which are reasonable;\n\nc. Injury to the public welfare;\n\nd. The harm to the franchisor;\n\n(15) To coerce, threaten, intimidate or require a franchisee under any condition affecting or related to a franchise agreement, or to waive, limit or disclaim a right that the franchisee may have pursuant to the provisions of sections 407.1025 to 407.1049. Any contracts or agreements which contain such provisions shall be deemed against the public policy of the state of Missouri and are void and unenforceable. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit voluntary settlement agreements;\n\n(16) To initiate any act enumerated in this subsection on grounds that it has advised a franchisee of its intention to discontinue representation at the time of a franchisee change.\n\n(L. 1998 H.B. 1055 § 4, A.L. 2025 S.B. 28)",
