A person that sells oil, gas, or other minerals at the wellhead or minehead is a person in the business of selling goods of that kind. A buyer in ordinary course of business may buy for cash, by exchange of other property, or on secured or unsecured credit, and may acquire goods or documents of title under a preexisting contract for sale. Only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under article 2 may be a buyer in ordinary course of business. \"Buyer in ordinary course of business\" does not include a person that acquires goods in a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.\n\n(10)\"Conspicuous\", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is \"conspicuous\" or not is a decision for the court.

To be a document of title, a document shall purport to be issued by or addressed to a bailee and purport to cover goods in the bailee's possession which are either identified or are fungible portions of an identified mass.\n\n(17)\"Fault\"means a default, breach, or wrongful act or omission.\n\n(18)\"Fungible goods\"means:\n\n(A) goods of which any unit, by nature or usage of trade, is the equivalent of any other like unit; or\n\n(B) goods that by agreement are treated as equivalent.\n\n(19)\"Genuine\"means free of forgery or counterfeiting.\n\n(20)\"Good faith\", except as otherwise provided in article 5, means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\n\n(21)\"Holder\"means:\n\n(A) the person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession; or\n\n(B) the person in possession of a document of title if the goods are deliverable either to bearer or to the order of the person in possession.\n\n(22)\"Insolvency proceeding\"includes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or other proceeding intended to liquidate or rehabilitate the estate of the person involved.\n\n(23)\"Insolvent\"means:\n\n(A) having generally ceased to pay debts in the ordinary course of business other than as a result of bona fide dispute;\n\n(B) being unable to pay debts as they become due; or\n\n(C) being insolvent within the meaning of federal bankruptcy law.\n\n(24)\"Money\"means a medium of exchange currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government. The term includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental organization or by agreement between two or more countries.\n\n(25)\"Organization\"means a person other than an individual.\n\n(26)\"Party\", as distinguished from \"third party\", means a person that has engaged in a transaction or made an agreement subject to this chapter.\n\n(27)\"Person\"means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, public corporation, or any other legal or commercial entity.\n\n(28)\"Present value\"means the amount as of a date certain of one or more sums payable in the future, discounted to the date certain by use of either an interest rate specified by the parties if that rate is not manifestly unreasonable at the time the transaction is entered into or, if an interest rate is not so specified, a commercially reasonable rate that takes into account the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.\n\n(29)\"Purchase\"means taking by sale, lease, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest, issue or reissue, gift, or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.\n\n(30)\"Purchaser\"means a person that takes by purchase.\n\n(31)\"Record\"means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.\n\n(32)\"Remedy\"means any remedial right to which an aggrieved party is entitled with or without resort to a tribunal.\n\n(33)\"Representative\"means a person empowered to act for another, including an agent, an officer of a corporation or association, and a trustee, executor, or administrator of an estate.\n\n(34)\"Right\"includes remedy.\n\n(35)\"Security interest\"means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. \"Security interest\" includes any interest of a consignor and a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, a payment intangible, or a promissory note in a transaction that is subject to article 9. \"Security interest\" does not include the special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under section 400.2-401, but a buyer may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with article 9. Except as otherwise provided in section 400.2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a \"security interest\", but a seller or lessor may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under section 400.2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest\". Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a \"security interest\" is determined pursuant to section 400.1-203.\n\n(36)\"Send\"in connection with a writing, record, or notice means:\n\n(A) to deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and, in the case of an instrument, to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances; or\n\n(B) in any other way to cause to be received any record or notice within the time it would have arrived if properly sent.\n\n(37)\"Signed\"includes using any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.\n\n(38)\"State\"means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, or any territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n(39)\"Surety\"includes a guarantor or other secondary obligor.\n\n(40)\"Term\"means a portion of an agreement that relates to a particular matter.\n\n(41)\"Unauthorized signature\"means a signature made without actual, implied, or apparent authority. The term includes a forgery.\n\n(42)\"Warehouse receipt\"means a receipt issued by a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire.\n\n(43)\"Writing\"includes printing, typewriting, or any other intentional reduction to tangible form.\"Written\"has a corresponding meaning.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 1-201, A.L. 1988 S.B. 583, A.L. 1992 S.B. 448, A.L. 2001 S.B. 288, A.L. 2017 H.B. 34)",

An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 1-202, A.L. 2017 H.B. 34)",

Course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade. —(a) A\"course of performance\"is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:\n\n(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and\n\n(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.\n\n(b) A\"course of dealing\"is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.\n\n(c) A\"usage of trade\"is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage shall be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.\n\n(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.\n\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable:\n\n(1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;\n\n(2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and\n\n(3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.\n\n(f) Subject to section 400.2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.\n\n(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.\n\n(L. 2017 H.B. 34)",

In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this chapter.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 2-207)\n\n(1975) Where seller acknowledged buyer's purchase order which did not agree to sell exactly what buyer offered to buy an acceptance was effected. Steward-Decatur Security System v. Von Weise Gear Co. (C.A. M0), 517 F.2d 1136.\n\n(1981) Buyer's purchase order containing general reference to seller's price quotation document was a definite and reasonable expression of acceptance within purview of Uniform Commercial Code, despite fact that purchase order contained additional handwritten warranty clause. Boese-Hilburn Co. v. Dean Machinery Co. (A.), 616 S.W.2d 520.\n\n(1981) An acceptance which merely implies that it is \"conditional\" on an offeror's assent to a different or additional provision is insufficient to convert an acceptance into a rejection and a counteroffer. Boese-Hilburn Co. v. Dean Machinery Co. (A.), 616 S.W.2d 520.\n\n(1981) Applicability of subdivision (2) of section 400.2-207 does not turn upon characterization of varying terms of acceptance as \"additional\" or \"different\". Boese-Hilburn Co. v. Dean Machinery Co. (A.), 616 S.W.2d 520.\n\n(1981) Inclusion of a warranty clause where none previously existed and was expressly disclaimed constitutes a \"material\" alteration. Boese-Hilburn Co. v. Dean Machinery Co. (A.), 616 S.W.2d 520.",

Delegation of performance — assignment of rights. —(1) A party may perform his or her duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his or her original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him or her by his or her contract, or impair materially his or her chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his or her entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.\n\n(3) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) of this section unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.\n\n(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of \"the contract\" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.\n\n(5) An assignment of \"the contract\" or of \"all my rights under the contract\" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him or her to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.\n\n(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his or her rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 400.2-609).\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 2-210, A.L. 2001 S.B. 288)\n\nEffective 7-01-01",

When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though\n\n(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or\n\n(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or\n\n(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a \"cash sale\", or\n\n(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.\n\n(2) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.\n\n(3)\"Entrusting\"includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.\n\n(4) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles of secured transactions (article 9), bulk transfers (article 6) and documents of title (article 7).\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 2-403)",

To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.\n\n(7) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.\n\n(8) If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this Article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.\n\n(9) Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 448, A.L. 2001 S.B. 288)\n\nEffective 7-01-01",

The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.\n\n(b) If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.\n\n(c) A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number.\n\n(2) If an instrument is payable to:\n\n(i) a trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;\n\n(ii) a person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative;\n\n(iii) a fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization; or\n\n(iv) an office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person, the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.\n\n(d) If an instrument is payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 3-110, A.L. 1992 S.B. 448)",

Except as provided in Section 400.3-605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.\n\n(d) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with process, or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.\n\n(e) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 448)",

Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances.

The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.\n\n(d) If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 400.4A-204 and 400.4A-304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.\n\n(e) If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 400.4A-302(a)(1), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d).\n\n(f) The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in subsection (c) or to receive refund under subsection (d) may not be varied by agreement.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 448)",

A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this article.\n\n(d) Rights and obligations of an issuer to a beneficiary or a nominated person under a letter of credit are independent of the existence, performance or nonperformance of a contract or arrangement out of which the letter of credit arises or which underlies it, including contracts or arrangements between the issuer and the applicant and between the applicant and the beneficiary.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 5-103, A.L. 1997 S.B. 6)",

If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant's election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer.

If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.\n\n(b) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a), such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by article 9.\n\n(c) A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) or a security interest under subsection (b) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:\n\n(1) deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:\n\n(A) actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;\n\n(B) power to obtain delivery under section 400.7-403; or\n\n(C) power of disposition under sections 400.2-403, 400.2A-304(2), 400.2A-305(2), 400.9-320, or 400.9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law; or\n\n(2) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.\n\n(d) A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (a) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit.

The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.

A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.\n\n(b) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:\n\n(1) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods shall be notified.\n\n(2) The notification shall include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.\n\n(3) The sale shall conform to the terms of the notification.\n\n(4) The sale shall be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored.\n\n(5) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale shall be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement shall include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale shall take place at least fifteen days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement shall be posted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.\n\n(c) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but shall be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this article.\n\n(d) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.\n\n(f) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.\n\n(g) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.\n\n(h) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection (a) or (b).\n\n(i) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 7-210, A.L. 2017 H.B. 34)",

However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.\n\n(e) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars.

In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue;\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.\n\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in section 400.8-205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.\n\n(d) All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.\n\n(e) This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security \"when, as and if issued\" or \"when distributed\" in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.\n\n(f) If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 8-202, A.L. 1992 S.B. 448, A.L. 1997 S.B. 6)",

The demand is effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.\n\n(b) If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer or an instruction is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security after a demand that the issuer not register transfer has become effective, the issuer shall promptly communicate to:\n\n(i) The person who initiated the demand at the address provided in the demand; and\n\n(ii) The person who presented the security for registration of transfer or initiated the instruction requesting registration of transfer a notification stating that:\n\n(1) The certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer or the instruction for registration of transfer of the uncertificated security has been received;\n\n(2) A demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been received; and\n\n(3) The issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of time stated in the notification in order to provide the person who initiated the demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or an indemnity bond.\n\n(c) The period described in subsection (b)(3) may not exceed thirty days after the date of communication of the notification. A shorter period may be specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.\n\n(d) An issuer is not liable to a person who initiated a demand that the issuer not register transfer for any loss the person suffers as a result of registration of a transfer pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction if the person who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the issuer's communication, either:\n\n(1) Obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction or other process from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer; or\n\n(2) File with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing to register the transfer.\n\n(e) This section does not relieve an issuer from liability for registering transfer pursuant to an indorsement or instruction that was not effective.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 503 § 8-403, A.L. 1992 S.B. 448, A.L. 1997 S.B. 6)",
