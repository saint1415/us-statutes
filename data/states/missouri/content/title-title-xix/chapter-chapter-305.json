Aeronautics program, highways and transportation commission to administer — purposes — aviation trust fund, administration, uses — appropriation — immediate availability of funds in the event of a disaster. —1. The state highways and transportation commission shall administer an aeronautics program within this state. The commission shall encourage, foster and participate with the political subdivisions of this state in the promotion and development of aeronautics. The commission may provide financial assistance in the form of grants from funds appropriated for such purpose to any political subdivision or instrumentality of this state acting independently or jointly or to the owner or owners of any privately owned airport designated as a reliever by the Federal Aviation Administration for the planning, acquisition, construction, improvement or maintenance of airports, or for other aeronautical purposes.\n\n2. Any political subdivision or instrumentality of this state or the owner or owners of any privately owned airport designated as a reliever by the Federal Aviation Administration receiving state funds for the purchase, construction, or improvement, except maintenance, of an airport shall agree before any funds are paid to it to control by ownership or lease the airport for a period equal to the useful life of the project as determined by the commission following the last payment of state or federal funds to it. In the event an airport authority ceases to exist for any reason, this obligation shall be carried out by the governing body which created the authority.\n\n3. Unless otherwise provided, grants to political subdivisions, instrumentalities or to the owner or owners of any privately owned airport designated as a reliever by the Federal Aviation Administration shall be made from the aviation trust fund. In making grants, the commission shall consider whether the local community has given financial support to the airport in the past. Priority shall be given to airports with local funding for the past five years with no reduction in such funding. The aviation trust fund is a revolving trust fund exempt from the provisions of section 33.080 relating to the transfer of funds to the general revenue funds of the state by the state treasurer. All interest earned upon the balance in the aviation trust fund shall be deposited to the credit of the same fund.\n\n4. The moneys in the aviation trust fund shall be administered by the commission and, when appropriated, shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n(1) As matching funds on an up to ninety percent state/ten percent local basis, except in the case where federal funds are being matched, when the ratio of state and local funds used to match the federal funds shall be fifty percent state/fifty percent local:\n\n(a) For preventive maintenance of runways, taxiways and aircraft parking areas, and for emergency repairs of the same;\n\n(b) For the acquisition of land for the development and improvement of airports;\n\n(c) For the earthwork and drainage necessary for the construction, reconstruction or repair of runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas;\n\n(d) For the construction, or restoration of runways, taxiways, or aircraft parking areas;\n\n(e) For the acquisition of land or easements necessary to satisfy Federal Aviation Administration safety requirements;\n\n(f) For the identification, marking or removal of natural or manmade obstructions to airport control zone surfaces and safety areas;\n\n(g) For the installation of runway, taxiway, boundary, ramp, or obstruction lights, together with any work directly related to the electrical equipment;\n\n(h) For the erection of fencing on or around the perimeter of an airport;\n\n(i) For purchase, installation or repair of air navigational and landing aid facilities and communication equipment;\n\n(j) For engineering related to a project funded under the provisions of this section and technical studies or consultation related to aeronautics;\n\n(k) For airport planning projects including master plans and site selection for development of new airports, for updating or establishing master plans, airport layout plans, airport business plans, and strategic plans at existing airports;\n\n(l) For the purchase, installation, or repair of safety equipment and such other capital improvements and equipment as may be required for the safe and efficient operation of the airport;\n\n(m) If at least four million five hundred thousand dollars is deposited into the aviation trust fund in the previous calendar year, funds may be spent for the study or promotion of expanded domestic or international scheduled commercial service, the study or promotion of intrastate scheduled commercial service, the promotion of aviation in the state, or to assist airport sponsors participating in a federally funded air service program supporting intrastate scheduled commercial service, subject to the following provisions:\n\na. No more than two million dollars may be spent from the aviation trust fund for the purposes provided in this paragraph in any calendar year; and\n\nb. The commission shall be required to expend at least four million dollars of the annual, calendar year deposits into the aviation trust fund for purposes other than the purposes described in this paragraph;\n\n(2) As total funds, with no local match:\n\n(a) For providing air markers, windsocks, and other items determined to be in the interest of the safety of the general flying public;\n\n(b) For the printing and distribution of state aeronautical charts and state airport directories on an annual basis, and a newsletter on a quarterly basis or the publishing and distribution of any public interest information deemed necessary by the commission;\n\n(c) For the conducting of aviation safety workshops;\n\n(d) For the promotion of aerospace education;\n\n(3) As total funds with no local match, up to five hundred thousand dollars per year may be used for the cost of operating existing air traffic control towers that do not receive funding from the Federal Aviation Administration or the United States Department of Defense, except no more than one hundred sixty-seven thousand dollars per year may be used for any individual control tower;\n\n(4) As total funds with a local match, up to five hundred thousand dollars per year may be used for air traffic control towers partially funded by the federal government under a cost-share program. Any expenditures under this program require a nonfederal match, comprised of a ratio of fifty percent state and fifty percent local funds. No more than one hundred thousand dollars per year may be expended for any individual control tower.\n\n5. In the event of a natural or manmade disaster which closes any runway or renders inoperative any electronic or visual landing aid at an airport, any funds appropriated for the purpose of capital improvements or maintenance of airports may be made immediately available for necessary repairs once they are approved by the commission. For projects designated as emergencies by the commission, all requirements relating to normal procurement of engineering and construction services are waived.\n\n6. As used in this section, the term\"instrumentality of the state\"shall mean any state educational institution as defined in section 176.010 or any state agency which owned or operated an airport on January 1, 1997, and continues to own or operate such airport.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1315 § 1, A.L. 1965 p. 501, A.L. 1971 S.B. 351, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1116 & 1117, A.L. 1985 S.B. 145 & 166, A.L. 1986 S.B. 550, A.L. 1991 S.B. 6, A.L. 1998 S.B. 619, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1196, A.L. 2005 S.B. 396, A.L. 2008 S.B. 930 & 947, A.L. 2014 H.B. 2141 merged with S.B. 818)\n\nEffective 8-28-14 (S.B. 818); 1-01-16 (H.B. 2141)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nAviation trust fund, created, 155.090",

The authority may for airspace clearance and navigational purposes provide for the zoning of all territory within two miles of the boundaries of an instrument authority airport and within one mile of the boundaries of a noninstrument authority airport for the purpose and intent of preventing or eliminating hazards on the ground and in the air which obstruct or interfere with the use of an authority airport, such as natural and man-made obstructions, lights, smoke and electronic interferences.\n\n2. No such zoning regulation shall limit any existing use or require the reduction in height of any existing structure without the owner's consent or the payment of compensation for damages or loss resulting therefrom.\n\n3. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, abatement, or marking, lighting or shielding of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which the authority may expend funds and acquire land or property rights therein.\n\n4. The chairman shall establish an airport zoning committee consisting of five members of the authority, not more than one of which shall be representatives of the same area within the boundaries of the authority. Each member so appointed shall serve as a member of the committee during his term as member of the authority. The committee shall recommend the adoption of zoning regulations and*hear appeals for the zoning of authority airports.\n\n5. Before any zoning regulations are made or changed, except permissible variances, the committee shall hold at least one public hearing at which any interested person may appear in person or by counsel to present his views. The public hearings shall be held only after notice thereof has been given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation within the area subject to the zoning regulations once each week for four consecutive weeks next preceding the time set for the hearing and by posting the same notice in ten conspicuous places within the area, and all costs of the publication shall be paid for by the authority.\n\n6. Zoning regulations of the authority shall be adopted, decided, revised or altered, only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of those members of the committee present at the public hearing or at some meeting within thirty days thereafter at which at the time of voting a majority of the entire committee is present. In the event of conflict between any airport zoning regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of this section and some other permissible zoning regulation, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.\n\n7. All airport zoning regulations adopted by the authority under sections 305.500 to 305.585 shall be enforced by the city or county agency in which the zoning is applicable and which has the duty of enforcing zoning and building regulations within their area. The authority shall provide each city and county zoning agency with maps, charts, and visual displays as necessary and convenient for a coordinated, efficient and effective enforcement. The authority shall provide each city and county zoning agency technical advice and representation when so requested for the purposes of sections 305.500 to 305.585.\n\n8. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to erect any structure or to change any existing structure or to permit any natural growth in variance of zoning regulations made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall apply for permission to make such variance with the authority. Such variances shall be allowed if a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and the provisions of sections 305.500 to 305.585, but any variance shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as the airport zoning board may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this section. In granting any variance, the authority shall require, and the person, firm, or corporation seeking the variance shall install, operate and maintain thereon, at the expense of said person, firm, or corporation seeking the variance, such markers, lights and shielding as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of any hazard, obstruction and interference which may result from the variance.\n\n9. Any person, firm or corporation or any political subdivision which believes it has been aggrieved by any decision regarding zoning regulations made by the airport authority may appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the zoning regulations applies for judicial review of the regulation and the method in which it was adopted. The action must be begun within thirty days after the regulation becomes effective, and the court shall hear the issues and make its determination in the same manner as judicial review may be had for any other administrative decision.\n\n10. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of sections 305.500 to 305.585 or acting contrary to any zoning regulation which may be adopted pursuant to the provisions of sections 305.500 to 305.585 is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided by law, and each day of violation of any such zoning regulation constitutes a separate offense.\n\n11. No such zoning regulation shall limit any existing use without the owner's consent or the payment of compensation for damages or loss resulting therefrom in the manner prescribed by chapter 523.\n\n(L. 1972 H.B. 1341 § 16)\n\nEffective 2-04-72\n\n*Word \"to\" appears here in original rolls.",

It is hereby found that the location of a new major airport will increase the value and rate of development of the land adjacent to the site; that the control of such development will be of benefit to the entire community; that the assessed value of taxable property and the tax resources will be significantly greater; and that the protection of inhabitants and the natural resources of the area is necessary to the enhancement of the community and to encourage the compatible existence of the airport and the community. Accordingly it is recognized that large aircraft generate noise which is objectionable to certain types of development and land use but is necessary for the safe and efficient flight of the aircraft and its service to the airport. Therefore, to encourage the successful coexistence of the community and the airport, to enhance the environment, and the general welfare of the community, and provide for the orderly development generated by a major airport, the authority, to minimize the adverse effects of aircraft noise, and in addition to zoning powers given in section 305.575, may provide for the land use zoning of all territory, for noise compatibility, included in a rectangle extending seven miles from each end of a runway and one and one-half miles each side of a runway centerline for each proposed and planned future runway for a major airport site.\n\n2. No such zoning regulation shall limit any existing use without the owner's consent or the payment of compensation for damages or loss resulting therefrom in the manner prescribed by chapter 523.\n\n3. Within one hundred and twenty days after the selection and approval of a site for a new major airport, the authority shall determine the probable levels of noise which will result from the operation of aircraft using the site and establish aircraft noise zones based thereon applicable to the property affected by such noise. As aircraft noise characteristics change with improved technology, the authority may make changes in the aircraft noise zones. No property shall be used, and no buildings or other structure shall be constructed or improved, within any aircraft noise zone, so that persons using the property and buildings are subjected to a level of noise in excess of the acceptable level established by the authority for that land use.\n\n4. It is further declared that both the control and establishment of compatible land use are public purposes for which the authority may expend funds and acquire land or property rights therein. The authority may retain any property acquired pursuant to this section and use it for a lawful purpose, or it may provide for the sale or other disposition.\n\n5. The chairman of the authority shall establish a five member major airport land use zoning committee consisting of three members of the authority, one of which shall be a representative of the same county in which the major airport is to be located, and two of which shall be citizens residing in the county in which the major airport is to be located. Each member of the major airport land use zoning committee shall serve as a member of the committee during his term as member of the authority and a citizen member shall serve a term of two years. The committee shall recommend the adoption of zoning regulations and hear appeals for the land use zoning.\n\n6. Zoning regulations made or changed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be made in the same manner as that provided in section 305.575, including the provisions for notice, and any person, firm or corporation or any political subdivision which believes it has been aggrieved by any decision regarding zoning regulations made by the airport authority pursuant to the provisions of this section may appeal that decision in the same manner as that provided in section 305.575.\n\n7. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to erect any structure or to change any existing structure or to permit any noncompliance use in variance of zoning regulations made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall apply for permission to make such variance with the authority. Such variances shall be allowed if a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and the provisions of sections 305.500 to 305.585, but any variance shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as the airport land use zoning board may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. In granting any variance, the authority shall require, and the person, firm, or corporation seeking the variance shall install, operate and maintain thereon, at the expense of said person, firm, or corporation seeking the variance, such soundproofing, lights and protection as may be necessary to protect people and the use of the land from objectionable and adverse aircraft noise which may result from the variance.\n\n(L. 1972 H.B. 1341 § 17)\n\nEffective 2-04-72",
