No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this state, or required to be registered in this state, shall operate, register or maintain registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle, unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this state. No nonresident shall operate or permit another person to operate in this state a motor vehicle registered to such nonresident unless the nonresident maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the requirements of the laws of the nonresident's state of residence. Furthermore, no person shall operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the other's vehicle; however, no owner or nonresident shall be in violation of this subsection if he or she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation. The director of the department of revenue shall establish by rule a process for voluntary suspension of motor vehicle registration for vehicles which are inoperable or being stored and not in operation. The owner or nonresident shall not further operate the vehicle until the owner or nonresident notifies the department of revenue that the vehicle will be in use, and the department shall reinstate the motor vehicle registration upon receipt of proof of financial responsibility. Owners or nonresidents who operate a motor vehicle during a period of inoperability or storage claimed under this subsection shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor and may additionally be guilty of a violation of this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department of revenue may verify motor vehicle financial responsibility as provided by law, but shall not otherwise take legal or administrative action to enforce the requirements of this section unless, in the discretion of the director, the motor vehicle is determined to have been operated in violation of this section, a motor vehicle registration is applied for in violation of this section, or the motor vehicle on two separate occasions thirty days apart is determined to have its registration maintained in violation of this section. The director may prescribe rules and regulations for the implementation of this section.\n\n2. A motor vehicle owner shall maintain the owner's financial responsibility in a manner provided for in section 303.160, or with a motor vehicle liability policy which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this state. A nonresident motor vehicle owner shall maintain the owner's financial responsibility which conforms to the requirements of the laws of the nonresident's state of residence.\n\n3. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a first violation of this section shall be punishable as a class D misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation of this section may be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a term not to exceed fifteen days and shall be punished by a fine not less than two hundred dollars but not to exceed five hundred dollars. Prior pleas of guilty and prior findings of guilty shall be pleaded and proven in the same manner as required by section 558.021. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this section if the operator demonstrates to the court that he or she met the financial responsibility requirements of this section at the time the peace officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle inspector wrote the citation. In addition to any other authorized punishment, the court shall notify the director of revenue of any person convicted pursuant to this section and shall do one of the following:\n\n(1) Enter an order suspending the driving privilege as of the date of the court order. If the court orders the suspension of the driving privilege, the court shall require the defendant to surrender to it any driver's license then held by such person. The length of the suspension shall be as prescribed in subsection 2 of section 303.042. The court shall forward to the director of revenue the order of suspension of driving privilege and any license surrendered within ten days;\n\n(2) Forward the record of the conviction for an assessment of four points;\n\n(3) In lieu of an assessment of points, render an order of supervision as provided in section 302.303. An order of supervision shall not be used in lieu of points more than one time in any thirty-six-month period. Every court having jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this section shall forward a record of conviction to the Missouri state highway patrol, or at the written direction of the Missouri state highway patrol, to the department of revenue, in a manner approved by the director of the department of public safety. The director shall establish procedures for the record keeping and administration of this section; or\n\n(4) For a nonresident, suspend the nonresident's driving privileges in this state in accordance with section 303.030 and notify the official in charge of the issuance of licenses and registration certificates in the state in which such nonresident resides in accordance with section 303.080.\n\n4. Nothing in sections 303.010 to 303.050, 303.060, 303.140, 303.220, 303.290, 303.330 and 303.370 shall be construed as prohibiting the department of commerce and insurance from approving or authorizing those exclusions and limitations which are contained in automobile liability insurance policies and the uninsured motorist provisions of automobile liability insurance policies.\n\n5. If a court enters an order of suspension, the offender may appeal such order directly pursuant to chapter 512 and the provisions of section 302.311 shall not apply.\n\n6.

The director shall inform each owner who registers a motor vehicle of the following:\n\n(1) The existence of the requirement that every motor vehicle owner in the state must maintain his financial responsibility;\n\n(2) The requirement that every motor vehicle owner show an insurance identification card, or a copy thereof, or other proof of financial responsibility at the time of vehicle registration; this notice shall be given at least thirty days prior to the month for renewal and shall be shown in bold, colored print;\n\n(3) The penalties which apply to violations of the requirement to maintain financial responsibility;\n\n(4) The benefits of maintaining coverages in excess of those which are required;\n\n(5) The director's authority to conduct samples of Missouri motor vehicle owners to ensure compliance.\n\n2. No motor vehicle owner shall be issued registration for a vehicle unless the owner, or his authorized agent, signs an affidavit provided by the director of revenue at the time of registration of the vehicle certifying that such owner has and will maintain, during the period of registration, financial responsibility with respect to each motor vehicle that is owned, licensed or operated on the streets or highways. The affidavit need not be notarized, but it shall be acknowledged by the person processing the form. The affidavit shall state clearly and in bold print the following: \"Any false affidavit is a crime under section 575.050 of Missouri law.\". In addition, every motor vehicle owner shall show proof of such financial responsibility by presenting his or her insurance identification card, as described in section 303.024, or a copy thereof, or some other proof of financial responsibility in the form prescribed by the director of revenue at the time of registration unless such owner registers his vehicle in conjunction with a reciprocity agreement entered into by the Missouri highway reciprocity commission pursuant to sections 301.271 to 301.279 or unless the owner insures the vehicle according to the requirements of the division of motor carrier and railroad safety pursuant to section 390.126.\n\n3. To ensure compliance with this chapter, the director may utilize a variety of sampling techniques including but not limited to random samples of registrations subject to this section, uniform traffic tickets, insurance information provided to the director at the time of motor vehicle registration, and persons who during the preceding year have received a disposition of court-ordered supervision or suspension. The director may verify the financial responsibility of any person sampled or reported.\n\n(1) Beginning January 1, 2001, the director may require such information, as in his or her discretion is necessary to enforce the requirements of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of this section, to be submitted from the person's insurer or insurance company. When requested by the director of revenue, all licensed insurance companies in this state which sell private passenger (noncommercial) motor vehicle insurance policies shall report information regarding the issuance, nonrenewal and cancellation of such policies to the director, excluding policies issued to owners of fleet or rental vehicles or issued on vehicles that are insured pursuant to a commercial line policy. Such information shall be reported electronically in a format as prescribed by the director of the department of revenue by rule.\n\n(2) When required by the director of revenue, each insurance company shall provide to the department a record of each policy issued, cancelled, terminated or revoked during the period since the previous report. The director of revenue may require insurance companies to provide such records as frequently as he or she deems necessary.\n\n(3) The director may use reports described in subdivision (1) of this subsection for sampling purposes as provided in this section.\n\n4. Information provided to the department by an insurance company for use in accordance with this section is the property of the insurer and is not subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 610. Such information may be utilized by the department for enforcement of this chapter but may not be disclosed except that the department shall disclose whether an individual is maintaining the required insurance coverage upon request of the following individuals and agencies only:\n\n(1) The individual;\n\n(2) The parent or legal guardian of an individual if the individual is an unemancipated minor;\n\n(3) The legal guardian of the individual if the individual is legally incapacitated;\n\n(4) Any person who has power of attorney from the individual;\n\n(5) Any person who submits a notarized release from the individual that is dated no more than ninety days before the request is made;\n\n(6) Any person claiming loss or injury in a motor vehicle accident in which the individual is involved;\n\n(7) The office of the state auditor, for the purpose of conducting any audit authorized by law.\n\n5.

Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2000, shall be invalid and void.\n\n6. Any person or agency who knowingly discloses information received from insurance companies pursuant to this section for any purpose, or to a person, other than those authorized in this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. No insurer shall be liable to any person for performing its duties pursuant to this section unless and to the extent the insurer commits a willful and wanton act of omission.\n\n7. The department of revenue shall notify the department of commerce and insurance of any insurer who violates any provisions of this section. The department of commerce and insurance may, against any insurer who knowingly fails to comply with this section, assess an administrative penalty up to five hundred dollars per day of noncompliance. The department of commerce and insurance may excuse the administrative penalty if an assessed insurer provides acceptable proof that such insurer's noncompliance was inadvertent, accidental or the result of excusable neglect. The penalty provisions of this section shall become effective six months after the rule issued pursuant to subsections 3 and 5 of this section is published in the code of state regulations.\n\n8. To verify that financial responsibility is being maintained, the director shall notify the owner or operator of the need to provide, within fifteen days, proof of the existence of the required financial responsibility. The request shall require the owner or the operator to state whether or not the motor vehicle was insured on the verification date stated in the director's request. The request may include but not be limited to a statement of the names and addresses of insurers, policy numbers and expiration date of insurance coverage.

Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of this chapter.\n\n9. Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other valid and collectible insurance.\n\n10.

If the motorist insurance identification database indicates the owner of a registered motor vehicle has, regardless of the owner's operation of such motor vehicle, failed to maintain the financial responsibility required in section 303.025 for two consecutive months, the designated agent shall on behalf of the director inform the owner that the director will suspend the owner's vehicle registration if the owner does not present proof of insurance as prescribed by the director within thirty days from the date of mailing. The designated agent shall not select owners of fleet or rental vehicles or vehicles that are insured pursuant to a commercial line policy for notification to determine motor vehicle liability coverage. The director may prescribe rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this subsection. The notice issued to the vehicle owner by the designated agent shall be sent to the last known address shown on the department's records. The notice is deemed received three days after mailing. The notice of suspension shall clearly specify the reason and statutory grounds for the suspension and the effective date of the suspension, the right of the person to request a hearing, the procedure for requesting a hearing and the date by which that request for a hearing must be made. The suspension shall become effective thirty days after the subject person is deemed to have received the notice of suspension by first class mail as provided in section 303.041. If the request for a hearing is received prior to the effective date of the suspension, the effective date of the suspension will be stayed until a final order is issued following the hearing; however, any delay in the hearing which is caused or requested by the subject person or counsel representing that person without good cause shown shall not result in a stay of the suspension during the period of delay.\n\n2. Neither the fact that, subsequent to the date of verification, the owner acquired the required liability insurance policy nor the fact that the owner terminated ownership of the motor vehicle shall have any bearing upon the director's decision to suspend. The suspension shall remain in force until termination despite the renewal of registration or acquisition of a new registration for the motor vehicle. The suspension shall also apply to any motor vehicle to which the owner transfers the registration.\n\n3. Upon receipt of notification from the designated agent, the director shall suspend the owner's vehicle registration effective immediately. The suspension period shall be as follows:\n\n(1) If the person's record shows no prior violation, the director shall terminate the suspension upon payment of a reinstatement fee of twenty dollars and submission of proof of insurance, as prescribed by the director;\n\n(2) If the person's record shows one prior violation for failure to maintain financial responsibility within the immediately preceding two years, the director shall terminate the suspension ninety days after its effective date upon payment of a reinstatement fee of two hundred dollars and submission of proof of insurance, as prescribed by the director;\n\n(3) If the person's record shows two or more prior violations for failure to maintain financial responsibility, the period of suspension shall terminate one year after its effective date upon payment of a reinstatement fee of four hundred dollars and submission of proof of insurance, as prescribed by the director.\n\n4. In the event that proof of insurance as prescribed by the director has not been filed with the department of revenue in accordance with this chapter prior to the end of the period of suspension provided in this section, such period of suspension shall be extended until such proof of insurance has been filed. In no event shall filing proof of insurance reduce any period of suspension. If proof of insurance is not maintained during the three-year period following the reinstatement or termination of the suspension, the director shall again suspend the license and motor vehicle registration until proof of insurance is filed or the three-year period has elapsed. In no event shall filing proof of insurance reduce any period of suspension.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, the director shall not suspend the registration or registrations of any owner who establishes to the satisfaction of the director that the owner's motor vehicle was inoperable or being stored and not operated on the date proof of financial responsibility is required by the director.\n\n(L. 1999 S.B. 19 § 4, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1797 merged with H.B. 1948)\n\nEffective 8-28-00 (H.B. 1948); 7-01-02 (H.B. 1797) see § 303.415\n\nExpires 6-30-07; see § 303.415",

Incentive program created — use of third-party vendors — comparison of information — use of data — access to system — suspension of registration, when, procedure — report — rulemaking authority. —1. (1) There is hereby created within the department of revenue the motor vehicle financial responsibility enforcement and compliance incentive program. The department of revenue may enter into contractual agreements with third-party vendors to facilitate the necessary technology and equipment, maintenance thereof, and associated program management services.\n\n(2) The department of revenue or a third-party vendor shall utilize technology to compare vehicle registration information with the financial responsibility information accessible through the system. The department of revenue shall utilize this information to identify motorists who are in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law. The department of revenue may offer offenders under this program the option of pretrial diversion as an alternative to statutory fines or reinstatement fees prescribed under the motor vehicle financial responsibility law as a method of encouraging compliance and discouraging recidivism.\n\n(3) The department of revenue or third-party vendors shall not use any data collected from or technology associated with any automated motor vehicle financial responsibility enforcement system. For purposes of this subdivision,\"motor vehicle financial responsibility enforcement system\"means a device consisting of a camera or cameras and vehicle sensor or sensors installed to record motor vehicle financial responsibility violations.\n\n(4) All fees paid to or collected by third-party vendors under sections 303.420 to 303.440 may come from violator diversion fees generated by the pretrial diversion option established under this section.\n\n2. The department of revenue may authorize law enforcement agencies or third-party vendors to use technology to collect data for the investigation, detection, analysis, and enforcement of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law.\n\n3. The department of revenue may authorize traffic enforcement officers or third-party vendors to administer the processing and issuance of notices of violation, the collection of fees for a violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law, or the referral of cases for prosecution, under the program.\n\n4. Access to the system shall be restricted to qualified agencies and the third-party vendors with which the department of revenue contracts for purposes of the program, provided that any third-party vendor with which a contract is executed to provide necessary technology, equipment, or maintenance for the program shall be authorized as necessary to collaborate for required updates and maintenance of system software.\n\n5. For purposes of the program, any data collected and matched to a corresponding vehicle insurance record as verified through the system, and any Missouri vehicle registration database, may be used to identify violations of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law. Such corresponding data shall constitute evidence of the violations.\n\n6. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department of revenue shall suspend, in accordance with section 303.041, the registration of any motor vehicle that is determined under the program to be in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law.\n\n7. The department of revenue shall send to an owner whose vehicle is identified under the program as being in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law a notice that the vehicle's registration may be suspended unless the owner, within thirty days, provides proof of financial responsibility for the vehicle or proof, in a form specified by the department of revenue, that the owner has a pending criminal charge for a violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law. The notice shall include information on steps an individual may take to obtain proof of financial responsibility and a web address to a page on the department of revenue's website where information on obtaining proof of financial responsibility shall be provided. If proof of financial responsibility or a pending criminal charge is not provided within the time allotted, the department of revenue shall provide a notice of suspension and suspend the vehicle's registration in accordance with section 303.041, or shall send a notice of vehicle registration suspension, clearly specifying the reason and statutory grounds for the suspension and the effective date of the suspension, the right of the vehicle owner to request a hearing, the procedure for requesting a hearing, and the date by which that request for a hearing must be made, as well as informing the owner that the matter will be referred for prosecution if a satisfactory response is not received in the time allotted, informing the owner that the minimum penalty for the violation is three hundred dollars, and offering the owner participation in a pretrial diversion option to preclude referral for prosecution and registration suspension under sections 303.420 to 303.440. The notice of vehicle registration suspension shall give a period of thirty-three days from mailing for the vehicle owner to respond, and shall be deemed received three days after mailing. If no request for a hearing or agreement to participate in the diversion option is received by the department of revenue prior to the date provided on the notice of vehicle registration suspension, the director shall suspend the vehicle's registration, effective immediately, and refer the case to the appropriate prosecuting attorney. If an agreement by the vehicle owner to participate in the diversion option is received by the department of revenue prior to the effective date provided on the notice of vehicle registration suspension, then upon payment of a diversion participation fee not to exceed two hundred dollars, agreement to secure proof of financial responsibility within the time provided on the notice of suspension, and agreement that such financial responsibility shall be maintained for a minimum of two years, no points shall be assessed to the vehicle owner's driver's license under section 302.302 and the department of revenue shall not take further action against the vehicle owner under sections 303.420 to 303.440, subject to compliance with the terms of the pretrial diversion option. The department of revenue shall suspend the vehicle registration of, and shall refer the case to the appropriate prosecuting attorney for prosecution of, participating vehicle owners who violate the terms of the pretrial diversion option. If a request for hearing is received by the department of revenue prior to the effective date provided on the notice of vehicle registration suspension, then for all purposes other than eligibility for participation in the diversion option, the effective date of the suspension shall be stayed until a final order is issued following the hearing. The department of revenue shall suspend the registration of vehicles determined under the final order to have violated the motor vehicle financial responsibility law, and shall refer the case to the appropriate prosecuting attorney for prosecution. Notices under this subsection shall be mailed to the vehicle owner at the last known address shown on the department of revenue's records. The department of revenue or its third-party vendor shall issue receipts for the collection of diversion participation fees. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of this section, all such fees shall be deposited into the motor vehicle financial responsibility verification and enforcement fund established in section 303.422. A vehicle owner whose registration has been suspended under sections 303.420 to 303.440 may obtain reinstatement of the registration upon providing proof of financial responsibility and payment to the department of revenue of a nonrefundable reinstatement fee equal to the fee that would be applicable under subsection 2 of section 303.042 if the registration had been suspended under section 303.041.\n\n8. Data collected or retained under the program shall not be used by any entity for purposes other than enforcement of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law. Data collected and stored by law enforcement under the program shall be considered evidence if noncompliance with the motor vehicle financial responsibility law is confirmed. The evidence, and an affidavit stating that the evidence and system have identified a particular vehicle as being in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law, shall constitute probable cause for prosecution and shall be forwarded in accordance with subsection 7 of this section to the appropriate prosecuting attorney.\n\n9. Owners of vehicles identified under the program as being in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law shall be provided with options for disputing such claims which do not require appearance at any state or local court of law, or administrative facility. Any person who presents timely proof that he or she was in compliance with the motor vehicle financial responsibility law at the time of the alleged violation shall be entitled to dismissal of the charge with no assessment of fees or fines. Proof provided by a vehicle owner to the department of revenue that the vehicle was in compliance at the time of the suspected violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law shall be recorded in the system established by the department of revenue under section 303.430.\n\n10. The collection of data pursuant to this section shall be done in a manner that prohibits any bias towards a specific community, race, gender, or socioeconomic status of vehicle owner.\n\n11. Law enforcement agencies, third-party vendors, or other entities authorized to operate under the program shall not sell data collected or retained under the program for any purpose or share it for any purpose not expressly authorized in this section. All data shall be secured and any third-party vendor or other entity authorized to operate under the program may be liable for any data security breach.\n\n12. The department of revenue shall not take action under sections 303.420 to 303.440 against vehicles registered as fleet vehicles under section 301.032, or against vehicles known to the department of revenue to be insured under a policy of commercial auto coverage, as such term is defined in subdivision (10) of subsection 2 of section 303.430.\n\n13. Following one year after the implementation of the program, and every year thereafter for a period of five years, the department of revenue shall provide a report to the president pro tempore of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the chairs of the house and senate committees with jurisdictions over insurance or transportation matters, and the chairs of the house budget and senate appropriations committees. The report shall include an evaluation of program operations, information as to the costs of the program incurred by the department of revenue, insurers, and the public, information as to the effectiveness of the program in reducing the number of uninsured motor vehicles, and anonymized demographic information including the race and zip code of vehicle owners identified under the program as being in violation of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law, and may include any additional information and recommendations for improvement of the program deemed appropriate by the department of revenue. The department of revenue may, by rule, require the state, counties, and municipalities to provide information in order to complete the report.\n\n14. The department of revenue may promulgate rules as necessary for the implementation of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2023 S.B. 398, A.L. 2024 S.B. 1359)",

Verification of financial responsibility, web-based system established — requirements — advisory council — rulemaking authority. —1. The department of revenue shall establish and maintain a web-based system for the verification of motor vehicle financial responsibility, shall provide access to insurance reporting data and vehicle registration and financial responsibility data, and shall require motor vehicle insurers to establish functionality for the verification system, as provided in sections 303.420 to 303.440. The verification system, including any exceptions as provided for in sections 303.420 to 303.440 or in the implementation guide developed to support the program, shall supersede any existing verification system, and shall be the sole system used for the purpose of verifying financial responsibility required under this chapter.\n\n2. The system established pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall be subject to the following:\n\n(1) The verification system shall transmit requests to insurers for verification of motor vehicle insurance coverage via web services established by the insurers through the internet in compliance with the specifications and standards of the Insurance Industry Committee on Motor Vehicle Administration, or \"IICMVA\". Insurance company systems shall respond to each request with a prescribed response upon evaluation of the data provided in the request. The system shall include appropriate protections to secure its data against unauthorized access, and the department of revenue shall maintain a historical record of the system data for a period of no more than twelve months from the date of all requests and responses. The system shall be used for verification of the financial responsibility required under this chapter. The system shall be accessible to authorized personnel of the department of revenue, the courts, law enforcement personnel, and other entities authorized by the state as permitted by state or federal privacy laws, and it shall be interfaced, wherever appropriate, with existing state systems. The system shall include information enabling the department of revenue to submit inquiries to insurers regarding motor vehicle insurance which are consistent with insurance industry and IICMVA recommendations, specifications, and standards by using the following data elements for greater matching accuracy: insurer National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or \"NAIC\", company code; vehicle identification number; policy number; verification date; or as otherwise described in the specifications and standards of the IICMVA. The department of revenue shall promulgate rules to offer insurers who insure one thousand or fewer vehicles within this state an alternative method for verifying motor vehicle insurance coverage in lieu of web services, and to provide for the verification of financial responsibility when financial responsibility is proven to the department to be maintained by means other than a policy of motor vehicle insurance. Insurers shall not be required to verify insurance coverage for vehicles registered in other jurisdictions;\n\n(2) The verification system shall respond to each request within a time period established by the department of revenue. An insurer's system shall respond within the time period prescribed by the IICMVA's specifications and standards. Insurer systems shall be permitted reasonable system downtime for maintenance and other work with advance notice to the department of revenue. Insurers shall not be subject to enforcement fees or other sanctions under such circumstances, or when systems are not available because of emergency, outside attack, or other unexpected outages not planned by the insurer and reasonably outside its control;\n\n(3) The system shall assist in identifying violations of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law in the most effective way possible. Responses to individual insurance verification requests shall have no bearing on whether insurance coverage is determined to be in force at the time of a claim. Claims shall be individually investigated to determine the existence of coverage. Nothing in sections 303.420 to 303.440 shall prohibit the department of revenue from contracting with a third-party vendor or vendors who have successfully implemented similar systems in other states to assist in establishing and maintaining this verification system;\n\n(4) The department of revenue shall consult with representatives of the insurance industry and may consult with third-party vendors to determine the objectives, details, and deadlines related to the system by establishment of an advisory council. Members of the advisory council shall serve in an advisory capacity in matters pertaining to the administration of sections 303.420 to 303.440, as the department of revenue may request. The advisory council shall expire one year after implementation of the program. The advisory council shall consist of voting members comprised of:\n\n(a) The director of the department of commerce and insurance, or his or her designee, who shall serve as chair;\n\n(b) Two representatives of the department of revenue, to be appointed by the director of the department of revenue;\n\n(c) One representative of the department of commerce and insurance, to be appointed by the director of the department of commerce and insurance;\n\n(d) Three representatives of insurance companies, to be appointed by the director of the department of commerce and insurance;\n\n(e) One representative from the Missouri Insurance Coalition;\n\n(f) One representative chosen by the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies;\n\n(g) One representative chosen by the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association;\n\n(h) One representative chosen by the Missouri Independent Agents Association; and\n\n(i) Such other representatives as may be appointed by the director of the department of commerce and insurance;\n\n(5) The department of revenue shall publish for comment, and then issue, a detailed implementation guide for its online verification system;\n\n(6) The department of revenue and its third-party vendors, if any, shall each maintain a contact person for insurers during the establishment, implementation, and operation of the system;\n\n(7) If the department of revenue has reason to believe a vehicle owner does not maintain financial responsibility as required under this chapter, it may also request an insurer to verify the existence of such financial responsibility in a form approved by the department of revenue. In addition, insurers shall cooperate with the department of revenue in establishing and maintaining the verification system established under this section, and shall provide motor vehicle insurance policy status information as provided in the rules promulgated by the department of revenue;\n\n(8) Every property and casualty insurance company licensed to issue motor vehicle insurance or authorized to do business in this state shall comply with sections 303.420 to 303.440, and corresponding rules promulgated by the department of revenue, for the verification of such insurance for every vehicle insured by that company in this state;\n\n(9) Insurers shall maintain a historical record of insurance data for a minimum period of six months from the date of policy inception or policy change for the purpose of historical verification inquiries;\n\n(10) For the purposes of this section,\"commercial auto coverage\"shall mean any coverage provided to an insured, regardless of number of vehicles or entities covered, under a commercial coverage form and rated from a commercial manual approved by the department of commerce and insurance. Sections 303.420 to 303.440 shall not apply to vehicles insured under commercial auto coverage; however, insurers of such vehicles may participate on a voluntary basis, and vehicle owners may provide proof at or subsequent to the time of vehicle registration that a vehicle is insured under commercial auto coverage, which the department of revenue shall record in the system;\n\n(11) Insurers shall provide commercial or fleet automobile customers with evidence reflecting that the vehicle is insured under a commercial or fleet automobile liability policy. Sufficient evidence shall include an insurance identification card clearly marked with a suitable identifier such as \"commercial auto insurance identification card\", \"fleet auto insurance identification card\", or other clear identification that the vehicle is insured under a fleet or commercial policy;\n\n(12) Notwithstanding any provision of sections 303.420 to 303.440, insurers shall be immune from civil and administrative liability for good faith efforts to comply with the terms of sections 303.420 to 303.440;\n\n(13) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from using the services of a third-party vendor for facilitating the verification system required under sections 303.420 to 303.440.\n\n3. The department of revenue shall promulgate rules as necessary for the implementation of sections 303.420 to 303.440.
