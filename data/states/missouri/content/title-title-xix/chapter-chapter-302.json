This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2017, shall be invalid and void.\n\n11. Biometric data, digital images, source documents, and licensee signatures, or any copies of the same, required to be collected or retained to comply with the requirements of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 shall be digitally retained for no longer than the minimum duration required to maintain compliance, and immediately thereafter shall be securely destroyed so as to make them irretrievable.\n\n12. No agency, department, or official of this state or of any political subdivision thereof shall use, collect, obtain, share, or retain radio frequency identification data from a REAL ID compliant driver's license or identification card issued by a state, nor use the same to uniquely identify any individual.\n\n13. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department of revenue shall not amend procedures for applying for a driver's license or identification card, nor promulgate any rule or regulation, for purposes of complying with modifications made to the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 after August 28, 2017, imposing additional requirements on applications, document retention, or issuance of compliant licenses or cards, including any rules or regulations promulgated under the authority granted under the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, as amended, or any requirements adopted by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators for furtherance thereof.\n\n14. If the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 is modified or repealed such that driver's licenses and identification cards issued by this state that are not compliant with the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 are once again sufficient for federal identification purposes, the department shall not issue a driver's license or identification card that complies with the federal REAL ID Act of 2005 and shall securely destroy, within thirty days, any source documents retained by the department for the purpose of compliance with such Act.\n\n(L. 2017 H.B. 151, A.L. 2018 S.B. 881, A.L. 2019 S.B. 89 merged with S.B. 368, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1963)",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an applicant does not meet the requirements of subsection 9 of this section and does not have the required documents to prove Missouri residency, United States naturalization, or lawful immigration status, the department may issue a one-year driver's license renewal. This one-time renewal shall only be issued to an applicant who previously has held a Missouri noncommercial driver's license, noncommercial instruction permit, or nondriver's license for a period of fifteen years or more and who does not have the required documents to prove Missouri residency, United States naturalization, or lawful immigration status.

When an applicant for a license has a license from a state which has requirements for issuance of a license comparable to the Missouri requirements or a license from a country which has a reciprocal agreement with the state of Missouri regarding the exchange of licenses pursuant to section 302.172 and such license has not expired more than six months prior to the date of application for the Missouri license, the director may waive the test of the applicant's practical knowledge of the traffic laws of this state, and the requirement of actual demonstration of ability to exercise due care in the operation of a motor vehicle. If the director has reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is suffering from some known physical or mental ailment which ordinarily would interfere with the applicant's fitness to operate a motor vehicle safely upon the highways, the director may require that the examination include a physical or mental examination by a licensed physician of the applicant's choice, at the applicant's expense, to determine the fact. The director shall prescribe regulations to ensure uniformity in the examinations and in the grading thereof and shall prescribe and furnish all forms to the members of the highway patrol and to other persons authorized to conduct examinations as may be necessary to enable the officer or person to properly conduct the examination. The records of the examination shall be forwarded to the director who shall not issue any license hereunder if in the director's opinion the applicant is not qualified to operate a motor vehicle safely upon the highways of this state.\n\n2. Beginning July 1, 2005, when the examiner has reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has committed fraud or deception during the examination process, the license examiner shall immediately forward to the director all information relevant to any fraud or deception, including, but not limited to, a statement of the examiner's grounds for belief that the person committed or attempted to commit fraud or deception in the written, skills, or vision examination.\n\n3. The director of revenue shall delegate the power to conduct the examinations required for a license or permit to any member of the highway patrol or any person employed by the highway patrol. The powers delegated to any examiner may be revoked at any time by the director of revenue upon notice.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections 1 and 3 of this section, the successful completion of a motorcycle rider training course approved pursuant to sections 302.133 to 302.137 shall constitute an actual demonstration of the person's ability to exercise due care in the operation of a motorcycle or motortricycle, and no further practical knowledge or driving test shall be required to obtain a motorcycle or motortricycle license or endorsement. The motorcycle rider training course completion shall be accepted for purposes of motorcycle license or endorsement issuance for one year from the date of course completion.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections 1 and 3 of this section, the successful completion of a military motorcycle rider training course that meets or exceeds the Motorcycle Safety Foundation curriculum standards by an applicant who is an active member of the United States Armed Forces, shall constitute an actual demonstration of the person's ability to exercise due care in the operation of a motorcycle or motortricycle, and no further practical knowledge or driving test shall be required to obtain a motorcycle or motortricycle license or endorsement. The military motorcycle rider training course completion shall be accepted for purposes of motorcycle license or endorsement issuance for one year from the date of course completion. The director of revenue is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for the administration and implementation of this subsection including rules governing the presentment of motorcycle training course completion cards from a military motorcycle rider training course or other documentation showing that the applicant has successfully completed a course in basic motorcycle safety instruction that meets or exceeds curriculum standards established by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation or other national organization whose purpose is to improve the safety of motorcyclists on the nation's streets and highways.

Any person between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years who is qualified to obtain a license pursuant to sections 302.010 to 302.340 may apply for, and the director shall issue, an intermediate driver's license entitling the applicant, while having such license in his or her possession, to operate a motor vehicle of the appropriate class upon the highways of this state in conjunction with the requirements of this section. An intermediate driver's license shall be readily distinguishable from a license issued to those over the age of eighteen. All applicants for an intermediate driver's license shall:\n\n(1) Successfully complete the examination required by section 302.173;\n\n(2) Pay the fee required by subsection 4 of this section;\n\n(3) Have had a temporary instruction permit issued pursuant to subsection 1 of section 302.130 for at least a six-month period or a valid license from another state; and\n\n(4) Have a parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or, if the applicant is a participant in a federal residential job training program, a driving instructor employed by a federal residential job training program, sign the application stating that the applicant has completed at least forty hours of supervised driving experience under a temporary instruction permit issued pursuant to subsection 1 of section 302.130, or, if the applicant is an emancipated minor, the person over twenty-one years of age who supervised such driving. For purposes of this section, the term\"emancipated minor\"means a person who is at least sixteen years of age, but less than eighteen years of age, who:\n\n(a) Marries with the consent of the legal custodial parent or legal guardian pursuant to section 451.080*;\n\n(b) Has been declared emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(c) Enters active duty in the Armed Forces;\n\n(d) Has written consent to the emancipation from the custodial parent or legal guardian; or\n\n(e) Through employment or other means provides for such person's own food, shelter and other cost-of-living expenses;\n\n(5) Have had no alcohol-related enforcement contacts as defined in section 302.525 during the preceding twelve months; and\n\n(6) Have no nonalcoholic traffic convictions for which points are assessed pursuant to section 302.302, within the preceding six months.\n\n2. An intermediate driver's license grants the licensee the same privileges to operate that classification of motor vehicle as a license issued pursuant to section 302.177, except that no person shall operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state under such an intermediate driver's license between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. unless accompanied by a person described in subsection 1 of section 302.130; except the licensee may operate a motor vehicle without being accompanied if the travel is to or from a school or educational program or activity, a regular place of employment or in emergency situations as defined by the director by regulation.\n\n3. Each intermediate driver's license shall be restricted by requiring that the driver and all passengers in the licensee's vehicle wear safety belts at all times.

For the first six months after issuance of the intermediate driver's license, the holder of the license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger who is under the age of nineteen who is not a member of the holder's immediate family. As used in this subsection, an intermediate driver's license holder's immediate family shall include brothers, sisters, stepbrothers or stepsisters of the driver, including adopted or foster children residing in the same household of the intermediate driver's license holder. After the expiration of the first six months, the holder of an intermediate driver's license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than three passengers who are under nineteen years of age and who are not members of the holder's immediate family. The passenger restrictions of this subsection shall not be applicable to any intermediate driver's license holder who is operating a motor vehicle being used in agricultural work-related activities.\n\n4.

(1) An intermediate driver's licensee who has, for the preceding twelve-month period, had no alcohol-related enforcement contacts, as defined in section 302.525 and no traffic convictions for which points are assessed, upon reaching the age of eighteen years or within the thirty days immediately preceding their eighteenth birthday may apply for and receive without further examination, other than a vision test as prescribed by section 302.173, a license issued pursuant to this chapter granting full driving privileges. Such person shall pay the required fee for such license as prescribed in section 302.177.\n\n(2) If an intermediate driver's license expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, such license shall remain valid for the five business days immediately following the expiration date. In no case shall a licensee whose intermediate driver's license expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday be guilty of an offense of driving with an expired or invalid driver's license if such offense occurred within five business days immediately following an expiration date that occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\n\n(3) The director of revenue shall deny an application for a full driver's license until the person has had no traffic convictions for which points are assessed for a period of twelve months prior to the date of application for license or until the person is eligible to apply for a six-year driver's license as provided for in section 302.177, provided the applicant is otherwise eligible for full driving privileges. An intermediate driver's license shall expire when the licensee is eligible and receives a full driver's license as prescribed in subdivision (1) of this section.\n\n7. No person upon reaching the age of eighteen years whose intermediate driver's license and driving privilege is denied, suspended, cancelled or revoked in this state or any other state for any reason may apply for a full driver's license until such license or driving privilege is fully reinstated. Any such person whose intermediate driver's license has been revoked pursuant to the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.540 shall, upon receipt of reinstatement of the revocation from the director, pass the complete driver examination, apply for a new license, and pay the proper fee before again operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state.\n\n8. A person shall be exempt from the intermediate licensing requirements if the person has reached the age of eighteen years and meets all other licensing requirements.\n\n9. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this section relating to intermediate drivers' licenses or the provisions of section 302.130 relating to temporary instruction permits is guilty of an infraction, and no points shall be assessed to his or her driving record for any such violation.\n\n10.

A digital image of the applicant's full facial features shall be taken in a manner prescribed by the director. No digital image shall be taken wearing anything which cloaks the facial features of the individual.\n\n5. The department of revenue may issue a temporary license or a full license without the photograph or with the last photograph or digital image in the department's records to members of the Armed Forces, except that where such temporary license is issued it shall be valid only until the applicant shall have had time to appear and have his or her picture taken and a license with his or her photograph issued.\n\n6.

The fee for nondriver's licenses issued for a period exceeding three years is six dollars or three dollars for nondriver's licenses issued for a period of three years or less. The nondriver's license card shall be used for identification purposes only and shall not be valid as a license.\n\n7. If otherwise eligible, an applicant may receive a driver's license or nondriver's license without a photograph or digital image of the applicant's full facial features except that such applicant's photograph or digital image shall be taken and maintained by the director and not printed on such license. In order to qualify for a license without a photograph or digital image pursuant to this section the applicant must:\n\n(1) Present a form provided by the department of revenue requesting the applicant's photograph be omitted from the license or nondriver's license due to religious affiliations. The form shall be signed by the applicant and another member of the religious tenant verifying the photograph or digital image exemption on the license or nondriver's license is required as part of their religious affiliation. The required signatures on the prescribed form shall be properly notarized;\n\n(2) Provide satisfactory proof to the director that the applicant has been a United States citizen for at least five years and a resident of this state for at least one year, except that an applicant moving to this state possessing a valid driver's license from another state without a photograph shall be exempt from the one-year state residency requirement. The director may establish rules necessary to determine satisfactory proof of citizenship and residency pursuant to this section;\n\n(3) Applications for a driver's license or nondriver's license without a photograph or digital image must be made in person at a license office determined by the director. The director is authorized to limit the number of offices that may issue a driver's or nondriver's license without a photograph or digital image pursuant to this section.\n\n8. The department of revenue shall make available, at one or more locations within the state, an opportunity for individuals to have their full facial photograph taken by an employee of the department of revenue, or their designee, who is of the same sex as the individual being photographed, in a segregated location.\n\n9. Beginning July 1, 2005, the director shall not issue a driver's license or a nondriver's license for a period that exceeds an applicant's lawful presence in the United States. The director may, by rule or regulation, establish procedures to verify the lawful presence of the applicant and establish the duration of any driver's license or nondriver's license issued under this section.\n\n10. (1) Notwithstanding any biometric data restrictions contained in section 302.170, the department of revenue is hereby authorized to design and implement a secure digital driver's license program that allows applicants applying for a driver's license in accordance with this chapter to obtain a secure digital driver's license in addition to the physical card-based license specified in this section.\n\n(2) A digital driver's license as described in this subsection shall be accepted for all purposes for which a license, as defined in section 302.010, is used.\n\n(3) The department may contract with one or more entities to develop the secure digital driver's license system. The department or entity may develop a mobile software application capable of being utilized through a person's electronic device to access the person's secure digital driver's license.\n\n(4) The department shall suspend, disable, or terminate a person's participation in the secure digital driver's license program if:\n\n(a) The person's driving privilege is suspended, revoked, denied, withdrawn, or cancelled as provided in this chapter; or\n\n(b) The person reports that the person's electronic device has been lost, stolen, or compromised.\n\n11. The director of the department of revenue may promulgate rules as necessary for the implementation of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010 that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028.

The director of revenue shall put into effect a point system for the suspension and revocation of licenses. Points shall be assessed only after a conviction or forfeiture of collateral. The initial point value is as follows:\n\n2. The director shall, as provided in subdivision (5) of subsection 1 of this section, assess an operator points for a conviction pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection 1 of section 302.020, when the director issues such operator a license or permit pursuant to the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.340.\n\n3. An additional two points shall be assessed when personal injury or property damage results from any violation listed in subdivisions (1) to (13) of subsection 1 of this section and if found to be warranted and certified by the reporting court.\n\n4. When any of the acts listed in subdivision (2), (3), (4) or (8) of subsection 1 of this section constitutes both a violation of a state law and a violation of a county or municipal ordinance, points may be assessed for either violation but not for both. Notwithstanding that an offense arising out of the same occurrence could be construed to be a violation of subdivisions (8), (9) and (10) of subsection 1 of this section, no person shall be tried or convicted for more than one offense pursuant to subdivisions (8), (9) and (10) of subsection 1 of this section for offenses arising out of the same occurrence.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall put into effect a system for staying the assessment of points against an operator. The system shall provide that the satisfactory completion of a driver-improvement program or, in the case of violations committed while operating a motorcycle, a motorcycle-rider training course approved by the state highways and transportation commission, by an operator, when so ordered and verified by any court having jurisdiction over any law of this state or county or municipal ordinance, regulating motor vehicles, other than a violation committed in a commercial motor vehicle as defined in section 302.700 or a violation committed by an individual who has been issued a commercial driver's license or is required to obtain a commercial driver's license in this state or any other state, shall be accepted by the director in lieu of the assessment of points for a violation pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (4) of subsection 1 of this section or pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.*The operator shall be given the option to complete the driver-improvement program through an online or in-person course.*A court using a centralized violation bureau established under section 476.385 may elect to have the bureau order and verify completion of a driver-improvement program or motorcycle-rider training course as prescribed by order of the court. For the purposes of this subsection, the driver-improvement program shall meet or exceed the standards of the National Safety Council's eight-hour \"Defensive Driving Course\" or, in the case of a violation which occurred during the operation of a motorcycle, the program shall meet the standards established by the state highways and transportation commission pursuant to sections 302.133 to 302.137. The completion of a driver-improvement program or a motorcycle-rider training course shall not be accepted in lieu of points more than one time in any thirty-six-month period and shall be completed within sixty days of the date of conviction in order to be accepted in lieu of the assessment of points. Every court having jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall, within fifteen days after completion of the driver-improvement program or motorcycle-rider training course by an operator, forward a record of the completion to the director, all other provisions of the law to the contrary notwithstanding. The director shall establish procedures for record keeping and the administration of this subsection.\n\n(L. 1961 p. 487, A.L. 1965 p. 477, A.L. 1975 S.B. 32, A.L. 1981 H.B. 335 Revision, A.L. 1982 S.B. 513, A.L. 1989 1st Ex.

Conviction for failure to maintain financial responsibility or court-ordered supervision, court to forward to revenue, failure to appear in court — procedure — revenue to maintain records of court reports. —1. Whenever a court convicts a person of a violation of section 303.025 or enters an order of court-ordered supervision, the clerk of the court shall within ten days forward a report of the conviction or order of supervision to the director of revenue in a form prescribed by the department of revenue. In any case where the person charged with the violation fails to appear in court, the procedures provided in section 302.341 shall apply. For the purposes of this section, the term \"court-ordered supervision\" is used to indicate where a court of record may, upon a plea or finding of guilt, defer further proceedings of a sentence, and enter an order for supervision of the defendant, if the defendant is charged with a violation, in which case no points shall be assessed.\n\n2. The department of revenue shall keep records of such reports. However, reports of court-ordered supervision shall not be released to any outside source, except the affected operator and those entities provided for in subsection 4 of section 32.091, and shall be used only to inform the director and the courts that such operator has previously been assigned court supervision.\n\n(L. 1999 S.B. 19)\n\nEffective 1-01-00",

The director shall notify by ordinary mail any operator of the point value charged against the operator's record when the record shows four or more points have been accumulated in a twelve-month period.\n\n2. In an action to suspend or revoke a license or driving privilege under this section points shall be accumulated on the date of conviction. No case file of any conviction for a driving violation for which points may be assessed pursuant to section 302.302 may be closed until such time as a copy of the record of such conviction is forwarded to the department of revenue.\n\n3.

The period of suspension of the driver's license and driving privilege of any person under the provisions of subdivision (8) of subsection 1 of section 302.302 or who has accumulated sufficient points together with a conviction under subdivision (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.302 shall be thirty days, followed by a sixty-day period of restricted driving privilege as defined in section 302.010. Upon completion of such period of restricted driving privilege, upon compliance with other requirements of law and upon filing of proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue, in accordance with chapter 303, the license and driving privilege shall be reinstated. If a person, otherwise subject to the provisions of this subsection, files proof of installation with the department of revenue that any vehicle operated by such person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device, there shall be no period of suspension. However, in lieu of a suspension the person shall instead complete a ninety-day period of restricted driving privilege. If the person fails to maintain such proof of the device with the director of revenue as required, the restricted driving privilege shall be terminated. Upon completion of such ninety-day period of restricted driving privilege, upon compliance with other requirements of law, and upon filing of proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue, in accordance with chapter 303, the license and driving privilege shall be reinstated. However, if the monthly monitoring reports during such ninety-day period indicate that the ignition interlock device has registered a confirmed blood alcohol concentration level above the alcohol setpoint established by the department of transportation or such reports indicate that the ignition interlock device has been tampered with or circumvented, then the license and driving privilege of such person shall not be reinstated until the person completes an additional thirty-day period of restricted driving privilege.\n\n6. If the person fails to maintain proof of financial responsibility in accordance with chapter 303, or, if applicable, if the person fails to maintain proof that any vehicle operated is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device installed pursuant to subsection 5 of this section, the person's driving privilege and license shall be resuspended.\n\n7. The director shall revoke the license and driving privilege of any person when the person's driving record shows such person has accumulated twelve points in twelve months or eighteen points in twenty-four months or twenty-four points in thirty-six months. The revocation period of any person whose license and driving privilege have been revoked under the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.540 and who has filed proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue in accordance with chapter 303 and is otherwise eligible, shall be terminated by a notice from the director of revenue after one year from the effective date of the revocation. Unless proof of financial responsibility is filed with the department of revenue, except as provided in subsection 2 of section 302.541, the revocation shall remain in effect for a period of two years from its effective date. If the person fails to maintain proof of financial responsibility in accordance with chapter 303, the person's license and driving privilege shall be rerevoked. Any person whose license and driving privilege have been revoked under the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.540 shall, upon receipt of the notice of termination of the revocation from the director, pass the complete driver examination and apply for a new license before again operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state.\n\n8. If, prior to conviction for an offense that would require suspension or revocation of a person's license under the provisions of this section, the person's total points accumulated are reduced, pursuant to the provisions of section 302.306, below the number of points required for suspension or revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section, then the person's license shall not be suspended or revoked until the necessary points are again obtained and accumulated.\n\n9. If any person shall neglect or refuse to surrender the person's license, as provided herein, the director shall direct the state highway patrol or any peace or police officer to secure possession thereof and return it to the director.\n\n10. Upon the issuance of a reinstatement or termination notice after a suspension or revocation of any person's license and driving privilege under the provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.540, the accumulated point value shall be reduced to four points, except that the points of any person serving as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States outside the limits of the United States during a period of suspension or revocation shall be reduced to zero upon the date of the reinstatement or termination of notice. It shall be the responsibility of such member of the Armed Forces to submit copies of official orders to the director of revenue to substantiate such overseas service. Any other provision of sections 302.010 to 302.540 to the contrary notwithstanding, the effective date of the four points remaining on the record upon reinstatement or termination shall be the date of the reinstatement or termination notice.\n\n11. No credit toward reduction of points shall be given during periods of suspension or revocation or any period of driving under a limited driving privilege granted by a court or the director of revenue.\n\n12. Any person or nonresident whose license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended or revoked under this or any other law shall, before having the license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle reinstated, pay to the director a reinstatement fee of twenty dollars which shall be in addition to all other fees provided by law.\n\n13. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if after two years from the effective date of any suspension or revocation issued under this chapter, except any suspension or revocation issued under section 302.410, 302.462, or 302.574, the person or nonresident has not paid the reinstatement fee of twenty dollars, the director shall reinstate such license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state. Any person who has had his or her license suspended or revoked under section 302.410, 302.462, or 302.574, shall be required to pay the reinstatement fee.\n\n14. No person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle suspended or revoked as a result of an assessment of points for a violation under subdivision (8), (9) or (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.302 shall have that license reinstated until such person has participated in and successfully completed a substance abuse traffic offender program defined in section 302.010, or a program determined to be comparable by the department of mental health. Assignment recommendations, based upon the needs assessment as described in subdivision (24) of section 302.010, shall be delivered in writing to the person with written notice that the person is entitled to have such assignment recommendations reviewed by the court if the person objects to the recommendations. The person may file a motion in the associate division of the circuit court of the county in which such assignment was given, on a printed form provided by the state courts administrator, to have the court hear and determine such motion pursuant to the provisions of chapter 517. The motion shall name the person or entity making the needs assessment as the respondent and a copy of the motion shall be served upon the respondent in any manner allowed by law. Upon hearing the motion, the court may modify or waive any assignment recommendation that the court determines to be unwarranted based upon a review of the needs assessment, the person's driving record, the circumstances surrounding the offense, and the likelihood of the person committing a like offense in the future, except that the court may modify but may not waive the assignment to an education or rehabilitation program of a person determined to be a prior or persistent offender as defined in section 577.001 or of a person determined to have operated a motor vehicle with fifteen-hundredths of one percent or more by weight in such person's blood. Compliance with the court determination of the motion shall satisfy the provisions of this section for the purpose of reinstating such person's license to operate a motor vehicle. The respondent's personal appearance at any hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection shall not be necessary unless directed by the court.\n\n15. The fees for the program authorized in subsection 14 of this section, or a portion thereof to be determined by the department of mental health, shall be paid by the person enrolled in the program. Any person who is enrolled in the program shall pay, in addition to any fee charged for the program, a supplemental fee in an amount to be determined by the department of mental health for the purposes of funding the substance abuse traffic offender program defined in section 302.010 or a program determined to be comparable by the department of mental health. The administrator of the program shall remit to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health on or before the fifteenth day of each month the supplemental fee for all persons enrolled in the program, less two percent for administrative costs. Interest shall be charged on any unpaid balance of the supplemental fees due the division of alcohol and drug abuse pursuant to this section and shall accrue at a rate not to exceed the annual rate established pursuant to the provisions of section 32.065, plus three percentage points. The supplemental fees and any interest received by the department of mental health pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the mental health earnings fund which is created in section 630.053.\n\n16. Any administrator who fails to remit to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health the supplemental fees and interest for all persons enrolled in the program pursuant to this section shall be subject to a penalty equal to the amount of interest accrued on the supplemental fees due the division pursuant to this section. If the supplemental fees, interest, and penalties are not remitted to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health within six months of the due date, the attorney general of the state of Missouri shall initiate appropriate action of the collection of said fees and interest accrued. The court shall assess attorney fees and court costs against any delinquent program.\n\n17. Any person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle suspended or revoked as a result of an assessment of points for a conviction for an intoxication-related traffic offense as defined under section 577.001, and who has a prior alcohol-related enforcement contact as defined under section 302.525, shall be required to file proof with the director of revenue that any motor vehicle operated by the person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device as a required condition of reinstatement of the license. The ignition interlock device shall further be required to be maintained on all motor vehicles operated by the person for a period of not less than six months immediately following the date of reinstatement. If the monthly monitoring reports show that the ignition interlock device has registered any confirmed blood alcohol concentration readings above the alcohol setpoint established by the department of transportation or that the person has tampered with or circumvented the ignition interlock device within the last three months of the six-month period of required installation of the ignition interlock device, then the period for which the person must maintain the ignition interlock device following the date of reinstatement shall be extended until the person has completed three consecutive months with no violations as described in this section. If the person fails to maintain such proof with the director, the license shall be resuspended or revoked and the person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(L. 1961 p. 487, A.L. 1972 S.B. 651, A.L. 1973 S.B. 257, A.L. 1979 S.B. 484, A.L. 1983 S.B. 318 & 135, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1575 Revision, A.L. 1989 1st Ex.

Any application for a limited driving privilege made to a circuit court shall name the director as a party defendant and shall be served upon the director prior to the grant of any limited privilege, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the applicant's driving record as certified by the director. Any applicant for a limited driving privilege shall have on file with the department of revenue proof of financial responsibility as required by chapter 303.

A copy of any court order shall be sent by the clerk of the court to the director, and a copy shall be given to the driver which shall be carried by the driver whenever such driver operates a motor vehicle. The director of revenue upon granting a limited driving privilege shall give a copy of the limited driving privilege to the applicant.

A conviction which results in the assessment of points pursuant to section 302.302, other than a violation of a municipal stop sign ordinance where no accident is involved, against a driver who is operating a vehicle pursuant to a limited driving privilege terminates the privilege, as of the date the points are assessed to the person's driving record. If the date of arrest is prior to the issuance of the limited driving privilege, the privilege shall not be terminated. Failure of the driver to maintain proof of financial responsibility, as required by chapter 303, or to maintain proof of installation of a functioning, certified ignition interlock device, as applicable, shall terminate the privilege. The director shall notify by ordinary mail the driver whose privilege is so terminated.\n\n(6) Except as provided in subdivision (8) of this subsection, no person is eligible to receive a limited driving privilege whose license at the time of application has been suspended or revoked for the following reasons:\n\n(a) A conviction of any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle was used and such conviction occurred within the five-year period prior to the date of application. However, any felony conviction for leaving the scene of an accident under section 577.060 shall not render the applicant ineligible for a limited driving privilege under this section;\n\n(b) Ineligibility for a license because of the provisions of subdivision (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), or (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.060; or\n\n(c) Due to a suspension pursuant to subdivision (8) or (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.302 or subsection 2 of section 302.525.\n\n(7) No person who possesses a commercial driver's license shall receive a limited driving privilege issued for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle if such person's driving privilege is suspended, revoked, cancelled, denied, or disqualified. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the issuance of a limited driving privilege for the purpose of operating a noncommercial motor vehicle provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege.\n\n(8) (a) Provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege, a circuit court or the director may, in the manner prescribed in this subsection, allow a person who has had such person's license to operate a motor vehicle revoked where that person cannot obtain a new license for a period of ten years, as prescribed in subdivision (9) of subsection 1 of section 302.060, to apply for a limited driving privilege pursuant to this subsection. Such person shall present evidence satisfactory to the court or the director that such person's habits and conduct show that the person no longer poses a threat to the public safety of this state. A circuit court shall grant a limited driving privilege to any individual who otherwise is eligible to receive a limited driving privilege, has filed proof of installation of a certified ignition interlock device, and has had no alcohol-related enforcement contacts since the alcohol-related enforcement contact that resulted in the person's license denial.\n\n(b) Provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege or convicted of acting with criminal negligence while driving while intoxicated to cause the death of another person, a circuit court or the director may, in the manner prescribed in this subsection, allow a person who has had such person's license to operate a motor vehicle revoked where that person cannot obtain a new license for a period of five years because of two convictions of driving while intoxicated, as prescribed in subdivision (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.060, to apply for a limited driving privilege pursuant to this subsection. Such person shall present evidence satisfactory to the court or the director that such person's habits and conduct show that the person no longer poses a threat to the public safety of this state. Any person who is denied a license permanently in this state because of an alcohol-related conviction subsequent to a restoration of such person's driving privileges pursuant to subdivision (9) of section 302.060 shall not be eligible for limited driving privilege pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision. A circuit court shall grant a limited driving privilege to any individual who otherwise is eligible to receive a limited driving privilege, has filed proof of installation of a certified ignition interlock device, and has had no alcohol-related enforcement contacts since the alcohol-related enforcement contact that resulted in the person's license denial.\n\n(9) A DWI docket or court established under section 478.007 may grant a limited driving privilege to a participant in or graduate of the program who would otherwise be ineligible for such privilege under another provision of law.\n\n4. Any person who has received notice of denial of a request of limited driving privilege by the director of revenue may make a request for a review of the director's determination in the circuit court of the county in which the person resides or the county in which is located the person's principal place of business or employment within thirty days of the date of mailing of the notice of denial. Such review shall be based upon the records of the department of revenue and other competent evidence and shall be limited to a review of whether the applicant was statutorily entitled to the limited driving privilege.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1961 p. 487, A.L. 1965 p. 477, A.L. 1967 p. 410, A.L. 1977 S.B. 478, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1983 H.B. 713 Revision, A.L. 1984 S.B. 608 & 681, A.L. 1987 S.B. 230, A.L. 1989 1st Ex.

Taylor v. Director of Revenue, 861 S.W.2d 134 (Mo. App. E.D.).\n\n(1998) A felony conviction involving the use of a motor vehicle precludes eligibility for hardship driving privileges without time limit. Hagan v. Director of Revenue, 968 S.W.2d 704 (Mo.banc).\n\n(2014) Provision allowing DWI court graduates and participants to obtain limited driving privileges while denying same opportunity to non-participants does not violate equal protection because it is rationally related to legitimate state interest in protecting public from drunk drivers.

A person commits the offense of driving while revoked if such person operates a motor vehicle on a highway when such person's license or driving privilege has been cancelled, suspended, or revoked under the laws of this state or any other state and acts with criminal negligence with respect to knowledge of the fact that such person's driving privilege has been cancelled, suspended, or revoked.\n\n2.

The license suspension or revocation shall become effective fifteen days after the subject person has received the notice of suspension or revocation as provided in section 302.520, or is deemed to have received the notice of suspension or revocation by mail as provided in section 302.515. If a request for a hearing is received by or postmarked to the department within that fifteen-day period, the effective date of the suspension or revocation shall be stayed until a final order is issued following the hearing; provided, that any delay in the hearing which is caused or requested by the subject person or counsel representing that person without good cause shown shall not result in a stay of the suspension or revocation during the period of delay.\n\n2. The period of license suspension or revocation under this section shall be as follows:\n\n(1) If the person's driving record shows no prior alcohol-related enforcement contacts during the immediately preceding five years, the period of suspension shall be thirty days after the effective date of suspension, followed by a sixty-day period of restricted driving privilege as defined in section 302.010 and issued by the director of revenue. The restricted driving privilege shall not be issued until he or she has filed proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue, in accordance with chapter 303, and is otherwise eligible. The restricted driving privilege shall indicate whether a functioning, certified ignition interlock device is required as a condition of operating a motor vehicle. A copy of the restricted driving privilege shall be given to the person and such person shall carry a copy of the restricted driving privilege while operating a motor vehicle. In no case shall restricted driving privileges be issued pursuant to this section or section 302.535 until the person has completed the first thirty days of a suspension under this section. If a person otherwise subject to the provisions of this subdivision files proof of installation with the department of revenue that any vehicle that he or she operates is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device, there shall be no period of suspension. However, in lieu of a suspension the person shall instead complete a ninety-day period of restricted driving privilege. Upon completion of such ninety-day period of restricted driving privilege, compliance with other requirements of law, and filing of proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue, in accordance with chapter 303, the license and driving privilege shall be reinstated. However, if the monthly monitoring reports during such ninety-day period indicate that the ignition interlock device has registered a confirmed blood alcohol concentration level above the alcohol setpoint established by the department of transportation or such reports indicate that the ignition interlock device has been tampered with or circumvented, then the license and driving privilege of such person shall not be reinstated until the person completes an additional thirty-day period of restricted driving privilege. If the person fails to maintain such proof of the device with the director of revenue as required, the restricted driving privilege shall be terminated;\n\n(2) The period of revocation shall be one year if the person's driving record shows one or more prior alcohol-related enforcement contacts during the immediately preceding five years;\n\n(3) In no case shall restricted driving privileges be issued under this section to any person whose driving record shows one or more prior alcohol-related enforcement contacts until the person has filed proof with the department of revenue that any motor vehicle operated by the person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device as a required condition of the restricted driving privilege.

For purposes of this section,\"alcohol-related enforcement contacts\"shall include any suspension or revocation under sections 302.500 to 302.540, any suspension or revocation entered in this or any other state for a refusal to submit to chemical testing under an implied consent law, and any conviction in this or any other state for a violation which involves driving while intoxicated, driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or driving a vehicle while having an unlawful alcohol concentration.\n\n4. Where a license is suspended or revoked under this section and the person is also convicted on charges arising out of the same occurrence for a violation of section 577.010 or 577.012 or for a violation of any county or municipal ordinance prohibiting driving while intoxicated or alcohol-related traffic offense, both the suspension or revocation under this section and any other suspension or revocation arising from such convictions shall be imposed, but the period of suspension or revocation under sections 302.500 to 302.540 shall be credited against any other suspension or revocation arising from such convictions, and the total period of suspension or revocation shall not exceed the longer of the two suspension or revocation periods.\n\n5. Any person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle revoked under this section or suspended under this section with one or more prior alcohol-related enforcement contacts showing on their driver record shall be required to file proof with the director of revenue that any motor vehicle operated by that person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device as a required condition of reinstatement. The ignition interlock device shall further be required to be maintained on all motor vehicles operated by the person for a period of not less than six months immediately following the date of reinstatement. If the monthly monitoring reports show that the ignition interlock device has registered any confirmed blood alcohol concentration readings above the alcohol setpoint established by the department of transportation or that the person has tampered with or circumvented the ignition interlock device within the last three months of the six-month period of required installation of the ignition interlock device, then the period for which the person must maintain the ignition interlock device following the date of reinstatement shall be extended until the person has completed three consecutive months with no violations as described in this section.

Such trial shall be conducted pursuant to the Missouri rules of civil procedure and not as an appeal of an administrative decision pursuant to chapter 536. The petition shall be filed in the circuit court of the county where the arrest occurred. The case shall be decided by the judge sitting without a jury.

The fees for the program authorized in subsection 1 of this section, or a portion thereof to be determined by the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health, shall be paid by the person enrolled in the program. Any person who is enrolled in the program shall pay, in addition to any fee charged for the program, a supplemental fee to be determined by the department of mental health for the purposes of funding the substance abuse traffic offender program defined in section 302.010 or a program determined to be comparable by the department of mental health. The administrator of the program shall remit to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health on or before the fifteenth day of each month the supplemental fee for all persons enrolled in the program, less two percent for administrative costs. Interest shall be charged on any unpaid balance of the supplemental fees due the division of alcohol and drug abuse pursuant to this section and shall accrue at a rate not to exceed the annual rate established pursuant to the provision of section 32.065 plus three percentage points. The supplemental fees and any interest received by the department of mental health pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the mental health earnings fund which is created in section 630.053.\n\n3. Any administrator who fails to remit to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health the supplemental fees and interest for all persons enrolled in the program pursuant to this section shall be subject to a penalty equal to the amount of interest accrued on the supplemental fees due the division pursuant to this section. If the supplemental fees, interest, and penalties are not remitted to the division of alcohol and drug abuse of the department of mental health within six months of the due date, the attorney general of the state of Missouri shall initiate appropriate action of the collection of said fees and interest accrued.

Temporary permit issued by officer, when — report required, contents — revocation of license, procedure — reinstatement, when — fees — proof of interlock device, when — violations, penalty. —1. If a person who was operating a vehicle refuses upon the request of the officer to submit to any chemical test under section 577.041, the officer shall, on behalf of the director of revenue, serve the notice of license revocation personally upon the person and shall take possession of any license to operate a vehicle issued by this state which is held by that person. The officer shall issue a temporary permit, on behalf of the director of revenue, which is valid for fifteen days and shall also give the person notice of his or her right to file a petition for review to contest the license revocation.\n\n2. Such officer shall make a certified report under penalties of perjury for making a false statement to a public official. The report shall be forwarded to the director of revenue and shall include the following:\n\n(1) That the officer has:\n\n(a) Reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested person was driving a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition; or\n\n(b) Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twenty-one years, was driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one percent or more by weight; or\n\n(c) Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twenty-one years, was committing a violation of the traffic laws of the state, or political subdivision of the state, and such officer has reasonable grounds to believe, after making such stop, that the person had a blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one percent or greater;\n\n(2) That the person refused to submit to a chemical test;\n\n(3) Whether the officer secured the license to operate a motor vehicle of the person;\n\n(4) Whether the officer issued a fifteen-day temporary permit;\n\n(5) Copies of the notice of revocation, the fifteen-day temporary permit, and the notice of the right to file a petition for review. The notices and permit may be combined in one document; and\n\n(6) Any license, which the officer has taken into possession, to operate a motor vehicle.\n\n3. Upon receipt of the officer's report, the director shall revoke the license of the person refusing to take the test for a period of one year; or if the person is a nonresident, such person's operating permit or privilege shall be revoked for one year; or if the person is a resident without a license or permit to operate a motor vehicle in this state, an order shall be issued denying the person the issuance of a license or permit for a period of one year.\n\n4. If a person's license has been revoked because of the person's refusal to submit to a chemical test, such person may petition for a hearing before a circuit division or associate division of the court in the county in which the arrest or stop occurred. Pursuant to local court rule promulgated pursuant to Section 15 of Article V of the Missouri Constitution, the case may also be assigned to a traffic judge pursuant to section 479.500. The person may request such court to issue an order staying the revocation until such time as the petition for review can be heard. If the court, in its discretion, grants such stay, it shall enter the order upon a form prescribed by the director of revenue and shall send a copy of such order to the director. Such order shall serve as proof of the privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state and the director shall maintain possession of the person's license to operate a motor vehicle until termination of any revocation under this section. Upon the person's request, the clerk of the court shall notify the prosecuting attorney of the county and the prosecutor shall appear at the hearing on behalf of the director of revenue. At the hearing, the court shall determine only:\n\n(1) Whether the person was arrested or stopped;\n\n(2) Whether the officer had:\n\n(a) Reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated or drugged condition; or\n\n(b) Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twenty-one years, was driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one percent or more by weight; or\n\n(c) Reasonable grounds to believe that the person stopped, being under the age of twenty-one years, was committing a violation of the traffic laws of the state, or political subdivision of the state, and such officer had reasonable grounds to believe, after making such stop, that the person had a blood alcohol content of two-hundredths of one percent or greater; and\n\n(3) Whether the person refused to submit to the test.\n\n5. If the court determines any issue not to be in the affirmative, the court shall order the director to reinstate the license or permit to drive.\n\n6. Requests for review as provided in this section shall go to the head of the docket of the court wherein filed.\n\n7. No person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle suspended or revoked under the provisions of this section shall have that license reinstated until such person has participated in and successfully completed a substance abuse traffic offender program defined in section 302.010, or a program determined to be comparable by the department of mental health. Assignment recommendations, based upon the needs assessment as described in subdivision (24) of section 302.010, shall be delivered in writing to the person with written notice that the person is entitled to have such assignment recommendations reviewed by the court if the person objects to the recommendations. The person may file a motion in the associate division of the circuit court of the county in which such assignment was given, on a printed form provided by the state courts administrator, to have the court hear and determine such motion under the provisions of chapter 517. The motion shall name the person or entity making the needs assessment as the respondent and a copy of the motion shall be served upon the respondent in any manner allowed by law. Upon hearing the motion, the court may modify or waive any assignment recommendation that the court determines to be unwarranted based upon a review of the needs assessment, the person's driving record, the circumstances surrounding the offense, and the likelihood of the person committing a similar offense in the future, except that the court may modify but shall not waive the assignment to an education or rehabilitation program of a person determined to be a prior or persistent offender as defined in section 577.001, or of a person determined to have operated a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of fifteen-hundredths of one percent or more by weight. Compliance with the court determination of the motion shall satisfy the provisions of this section for the purpose of reinstating such person's license to operate a motor vehicle. The respondent's personal appearance at any hearing conducted under this subsection shall not be necessary unless directed by the court.\n\n8. The fees for the substance abuse traffic offender program, or a portion thereof, to be determined by the division of behavioral health of the department of mental health, shall be paid by the person enrolled in the program. Any person who is enrolled in the program shall pay, in addition to any fee charged for the program, a supplemental fee to be determined by the department of mental health for the purposes of funding the substance abuse traffic offender program defined in section 302.010. The administrator of the program shall remit to the division of behavioral health of the department of mental health on or before the fifteenth day of each month the supplemental fee for all persons enrolled in the program, less two percent for administrative costs. Interest shall be charged on any unpaid balance of the supplemental fees due to the division of behavioral health under this section, and shall accrue at a rate not to exceed the annual rates established under the provisions of section 32.065, plus three percentage points. The supplemental fees and any interest received by the department of mental health under this section shall be deposited in the mental health earnings fund, which is created in section 630.053.\n\n9. Any administrator who fails to remit to the division of behavioral health of the department of mental health the supplemental fees and interest for all persons enrolled in the program under this section shall be subject to a penalty equal to the amount of interest accrued on the supplemental fees due to the division under this section. If the supplemental fees, interest, and penalties are not remitted to the division of behavioral health of the department of mental health within six months of the due date, the attorney general of the state of Missouri shall initiate appropriate action for the collection of said fees and accrued interest. The court shall assess attorneys' fees and court costs against any delinquent program.\n\n10. Any person who has had a license to operate a motor vehicle revoked under this section and who has a prior alcohol-related enforcement contact, as defined in section 302.525, shall be required to file proof with the director of revenue that any motor vehicle operated by the person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device as a required condition of license reinstatement. Such ignition interlock device shall further be required to be maintained on all motor vehicles operated by the person for a period of not less than six months immediately following the date of reinstatement. If the monthly monitoring reports show that the ignition interlock device has registered any confirmed blood alcohol concentration readings above the alcohol setpoint established by the department of transportation or that the person has tampered with or circumvented the ignition interlock device within the last three months of the six-month period of required installation of the ignition interlock device, then the period for which the person shall maintain the ignition interlock device following the date of reinstatement shall be extended until the person has completed three consecutive months with no violations as described in this section. If the person fails to maintain such proof with the director as required by this section, the license shall be rerevoked until proof as required by this section is filed with the director, and the person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n11. The revocation period of any person whose license and driving privilege has been revoked under this section and who has filed proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue in accordance with chapter 303 and is otherwise eligible shall be terminated by a notice from the director of revenue after one year from the effective date of the revocation. Unless proof of financial responsibility is filed with the department of revenue, the revocation shall remain in effect for a period of two years from its effective date. If the person fails to maintain proof of financial responsibility in accordance with chapter 303, the person's license and driving privilege shall be rerevoked.\n\n12. A person commits the offense of failure to maintain proof with the Missouri department of revenue if, when required to do so, he or she fails to file proof with the director of revenue that any vehicle operated by the person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock device or fails to file proof of financial responsibility with the department of revenue in accordance with chapter 303. The offense of failure to maintain proof with the Missouri department of revenue is a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(L. 2014 S.B. 491, A.L. 2015 S.B. 254, A.L. 2019 H.B. 192 merged with H.B. 499)",

Driver license compact. —The \"Driver License Compact\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nDRIVER LICENSE COMPACT\n\nFindings and Declaration of Policy\n\n(a) The party states find that:\n\n(1) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.\n\n(2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property.\n\n(3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.\n\n(b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:\n\n(1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.\n\n(2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.\n\nDefinitions\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a)\"State\"means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(b)\"Home state\"means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle.\n\n(c)\"Conviction\"means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nReports of Conviction\n\nThe licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or whether the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith.\n\nEffect of Conviction\n\n(a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of conviction for:\n\n(1) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;\n\n(2) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;\n\n(3) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;\n\n(4) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.\n\n(b) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state.\n\n(c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this Article, such party state shall construe the denomination and description appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this Article.\n\nApplication for New Licenses\n\nUpon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if:\n\n(1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated.\n\n(2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.\n\n(3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.\n\nApplicability of Other Laws\n\nExcept as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nCompact Administrator and Interchange of Information\n\n(a) The head of the licensing authority of each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for his state. The administrators, acting jointly, shall have the power to formulate all necessary and proper procedures for the exchange of information under this compact.\n\n(b) The administrator of each party state shall furnish to the administrator of each other party state any information or documents reasonably necessary to facilitate the administration of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nEntry Into Force and Withdrawal\n\n(a) This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law.\n\n(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.\n\nConstruction and Severability\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 285 § 1)\n\n(2001) Use of word \"shall\" in Article III list of conviction reports without prescribing results that would follow from failure to provide all information makes section discretionary, not mandatory.

Operation without license prohibited, exceptions — instruction permit, use, duration, fee — license, test required, contents, fee — certification of third-party testers — certain persons prohibited from obtaining license, exceptions — testing accommodations for applicants with disabilities, rules, null and void when. —1. Except when operating under an instruction permit as described in this section, no person may drive a commercial motor vehicle unless the person has been issued a commercial driver's license with applicable endorsements valid for the type of vehicle being operated as specified in sections 302.700 to 302.780. A commercial driver's instruction permit shall allow the holder of a valid license to operate a commercial motor vehicle when accompanied by the holder of a commercial driver's license valid for the vehicle being operated and who occupies a seat beside the individual, or reasonably near the individual in the case of buses, for the purpose of giving instruction in driving the commercial motor vehicle. No person may be issued a commercial driver's instruction permit until he or she has passed written tests which comply with the minimum federal standards. A commercial driver's instruction permit shall be nonrenewable and shall be valid for the vehicle being operated for a period of not more than one year, and shall not be issued until the permit holder has met all other requirements of sections 302.700 to 302.780, except for the driving test. The fee for such permit shall be ten dollars. The fee for a duplicate of such commercial driver's instruction permit shall be five dollars.\n\n2. No person may be issued a commercial driver's license until he has passed written and driving tests for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle which complies with the minimum federal standards established by the Secretary and has satisfied all other requirements of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (Title XII of Pub. Law 99-570), as well as any other requirements imposed by state law. Beginning January 1, 2020, all applicants for a commercial driver's license shall complete any entry-level driver training program as established and required under 49 CFR 380.609. All applicants for a commercial driver's license shall have maintained the appropriate class of commercial driver's instruction permit issued by this state or any other state for a minimum of fourteen calendar days prior to the date of taking the skills test. Applicants for a hazardous materials endorsement must also meet the requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001 (Title X of Public Law 107-56) as specified and required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the director from establishing alternate testing formats for those who are functionally illiterate; provided, however, that any such alternate test must comply with the minimum requirements of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (Title XII of Pub. Law 99-570) as established by the Secretary.\n\n(1) The written and driving tests shall be held at such times and in such places as the superintendent may designate. A twenty-five dollar examination fee shall be paid by the applicant upon completion of any written or driving test, except the examination fee shall be waived for applicants seventy years of age or older renewing a license with a school bus endorsement. The director shall delegate the power to conduct the examinations required under sections 302.700 to 302.780 to any member of the highway patrol or any person employed by the highway patrol qualified to give driving examinations. The written test shall only be administered in the English language. No translators shall be allowed for applicants taking the test.\n\n(2) The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations governing the certification of third-party testers by the department of revenue. Such rules and regulations shall substantially comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 383, Section 383.75. A certification to conduct third-party testing shall be valid for one year, and the department shall charge a fee of one hundred dollars to issue or renew the certification of any third-party tester.\n\n(3) Beginning August 28, 2006, the director shall issue or renew third-party tester certification to community colleges established under chapter 178 or to private companies who own, lease, or maintain their own fleet and administer in-house testing to their employees, or to school districts and their agents that administer in-house testing to the school district's or agent's employees. Any third-party tester who violates any of the rules and regulations adopted and promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to having his certification revoked by the department. The department shall provide written notice and an opportunity for the third-party tester to be heard in substantially the same manner as provided in chapter 536. If any applicant submits evidence that he has successfully completed a test administered by a third-party tester, the actual driving test for a commercial driver's license may then be waived.\n\n(4) Every applicant for renewal of a commercial driver's license shall provide such certifications and information as required by the Secretary and if such person transports a hazardous material must also meet the requirements of the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001 (Title X of Public Law 107-56) as specified and required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Such person shall be required to take the written test for such endorsement. A twenty-five dollar examination fee shall be paid upon completion of such tests.\n\n(5) The director shall have the authority to waive the driving skills and written tests for any qualified current or former military service member applicant for a commercial driver's instruction permit or a commercial driver's license who is currently licensed at the time of application for a commercial driver's instruction permit or commercial driver's license. The director shall impose conditions and limitations and require certification and evidence to restrict the applicants from whom the department may accept the alternative requirements for the skills and written tests described in federal regulations 49 CFR 383.71 and 49 CFR 383.77. Applicants shall meet all federal and state qualifications to operate a commercial vehicle. Applicants shall be required to complete all applicable tests, except when the applicant provides proof of approved military training sufficient for waiver of the written knowledge and skills tests as specified in this subdivision and subdivision (5) of subsection 3 of section 302.170.\n\n3. A commercial driver's license or commercial driver's instruction permit may not be issued to a person while the person is disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle, when a disqualification is pending in any state or while the person's driver's license is suspended, revoked, or cancelled in any state; nor may a commercial driver's license be issued unless the person first surrenders in a manner prescribed by the director any commercial driver's license issued by another state, which license shall be returned to the issuing state for cancellation.\n\n4. Beginning July 1, 2005, the director shall not issue an instruction permit under this section unless the director verifies that the applicant is lawfully present in the United States before accepting the application. The director may, by rule or regulation, establish procedures to verify the lawful presence of the applicant under this section. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated pursuant to the authority of this section shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to chapter 536.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, beginning August 28, 2008, the director of the department of revenue shall certify as a third-party tester any municipality that owns, leases, or maintains its own fleet that requires certain employees as a condition of employment to hold a valid commercial driver's license; and that administered in-house testing to such employees prior to August 28, 2006.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, beginning December 1, 2019, the director of the department of revenue shall certify as a third-party tester any private education institution or other private entity, provided the institution or entity meets the necessary qualifications required by the state.\n\n7. The director shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations establishing a process for applicants with disabilities to request testing accommodations with respect to both the written and driving tests required under this section and to establish criteria for awarding such accommodations. The rules shall specify that a hearing test shall not be a component of the written test or driving test for any applicant who is deaf or hard of hearing. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2020, shall be invalid and void.\n\n8. If the United States Secretary of Transportation determines that subsection 7 of this section has the effect of placing the state of Missouri in noncompliance with any federal constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision that would result in the loss of any federal aid funds to the Missouri highways and transportation commission, then subsection 7 of this section shall be null and void.\n\n(L. 1989 1st Ex.

If a person refuses, upon the request of a law enforcement officer pursuant to section 302.745, to submit to any test allowed under that section, evidence of the refusal shall be admissible in any proceeding to determine whether a person was operating a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. In this event, the officer shall make a sworn report to the director that he or she requested a test pursuant to section 302.745 and that the person refused to submit to such testing.\n\n2. A person requested to submit to a test as provided by section 302.745 shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test will result in that person being immediately placed out of service for a period of twenty-four hours and being disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of not less than one year if for a first refusal to submit to the test and for life if for a second or subsequent refusal to submit to the test. The director may issue rules and regulations, in accordance with guidelines established by the secretary, under which a disqualification for life under this section may be reduced to a period of not less than ten years.\n\n3. Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under subsection 1 of this section, the director shall disqualify the driver from operating a commercial motor vehicle.\n\n4.

Upon his or her request, the clerk of the court shall notify the prosecuting attorney of the county and the prosecutor shall appear at the hearing on behalf of the officer. At the hearing the judge shall determine only:\n\n(1) Whether or not the law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving a commercial motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her system;\n\n(2) Whether or not the person refused to submit to the test.\n\n5. If the judge determines any issues not to be in the affirmative, he or she shall order the director to reinstate the privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle.\n\n6.
