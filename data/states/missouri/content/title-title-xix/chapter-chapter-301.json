Personal property taxes and federal heavy vehicle use tax, paid when — tax receipt forms — failure to pay personal property tax, effect of, notification requirements, reinstatement fee, appeals — rulemaking, procedure. —1. No state registration license to operate any motor vehicle in this state shall be issued unless the application for license of a motor vehicle or trailer is accompanied by a tax receipt for the tax year which immediately precedes the year in which the vehicle's or trailer's registration is due and which reflects that all taxes, including delinquent taxes from prior years, have been paid, or a statement certified by the county collector or collector-treasurer of the county in which the applicant's property was assessed showing that the state and county tangible personal property taxes for such previous tax year and all delinquent taxes due have been paid by the applicant, or a statement certified by the county or township collector for such previous year that no such taxes were assessed or due and, the applicant has no unpaid taxes on the collector's tax roll for any subsequent year or, if the applicant is not a resident of this state and serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, the application is accompanied by a leave and earnings statement from such person verifying such status or, if the applicant is an organization described pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 137.100 or subsection 1 of section 137.101, the application is accompanied by a document, in a form approved by the director, verifying that the organization is registered with the department of revenue or is determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a tax-exempt entity. If the director of the department of revenue has been notified by the assessor pursuant to subsection 2 of section 137.101, that the applicant's personal property is not tax exempt, then the organization's application shall be accompanied by a statement certified by the county collector or collector-treasurer of the county in which the organization's property was assessed showing that the state and county tangible personal property taxes for such previous tax year and all delinquent taxes due have been paid by the organization. In the event the registration is a renewal of a registration made two or three years previously, the application shall be accompanied by proof that taxes were not due or have been paid for the two or three years which immediately precede the year in which the motor vehicle's or trailer's registration is due. The county collector or collector-treasurer shall not be required to issue a receipt or certified statement that taxes were not assessed or due for the immediately preceding tax year until all personal property taxes, including all current and delinquent taxes, are paid. If the applicant was a resident of another county of this state in the applicable preceding years, he or she must submit to the collector or collector-treasurer in the county of residence proof that the personal property tax was paid in the applicable tax years. Every county collector and collector-treasurer shall give each person a tax receipt or a certified statement of tangible personal property taxes paid. The receipt issued by the county collector in any county of the first classification with a charter form of government which contains part of a city with a population of at least three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants which is located in more than one county, any county of the first classification without a charter form of government with a population of at least one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants which contains part of a city with a population of at least three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants which is located in more than one county and any county of the first classification without a charter form of government with a population of at least one hundred ten thousand but less than one hundred fifty thousand inhabitants shall be determined null and void if the person paying tangible personal property taxes issues or passes a check or other similar sight order which is returned to the collector because the account upon which the check or order was drawn was closed or did not have sufficient funds at the time of presentation for payment by the collector to meet the face amount of the check or order. The collector may assess and collect in addition to any other penalty or interest that may be owed, a penalty of ten dollars or five percent of the total amount of the returned check or order whichever amount is greater to be deposited in the county general revenue fund, but in no event shall such penalty imposed exceed one hundred dollars. The collector may refuse to accept any check or other similar sight order in payment of any tax currently owed plus penalty or interest from a person who previously attempted to pay such amount with a check or order that was returned to the collector unless the remittance is in the form of a cashier's check, certified check or money order. If a person does not comply with the provisions of this section, a tax receipt issued pursuant to this section is null and void and no state registration license shall be issued or renewed. Where no such taxes are due each such collector shall, upon request, certify such fact and transmit such statement to the person making the request. Each receipt or statement shall describe by type the total number of motor vehicles on which personal property taxes were paid, and no renewal of any state registration license shall be issued to any person for a number greater than that shown on his or her tax receipt or statement except for a vehicle which was purchased without another vehicle being traded therefor, or for a vehicle previously registered in another state, provided the application for title or other evidence shows that the date the vehicle was purchased or was first registered in this state was such that no personal property tax was owed on such vehicle as of the date of the last tax receipt or certified statement prior to the renewal. The director of revenue shall make necessary rules and regulations for the enforcement of this section, and shall design all necessary forms. If electronic data is not available, residents of counties with a township form of government and with collector-treasurers shall present personal property tax receipts which have been paid for the preceding two years when registering under this section.\n\n2. Every county collector in counties with a population of over six hundred thousand and less than nine hundred thousand shall give priority to issuing tax receipts or certified statements pursuant to this section for any person whose motor vehicle registration expires in January. Such collector shall send tax receipts or certified statements for personal property taxes for the previous year within three days to any person who pays the person's personal property tax in person, and within twenty working days, if the payment is made by mail. Any person wishing to have priority pursuant to this subsection shall notify the collector at the time of payment of the property taxes that a motor vehicle registration expires in January. Any person purchasing a new vehicle in December and licensing such vehicle in January of the following year may use the personal property tax receipt of the prior year as proof of payment.\n\n3. In addition to all other requirements, the director of revenue shall not register any vehicle subject to the heavy vehicle use tax imposed by Section 4481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 unless the applicant presents proof of payment, or that such tax is not owing, in such form as may be prescribed by the United States Secretary of the Treasury. No proof of payment of such tax shall be required by the director until the form for proof of payment has been prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n4. Beginning July 1, 2000, a county collector or collector-treasurer may notify, by ordinary mail, any owner of a motor vehicle for which personal property taxes have not been paid that if full payment is not received within thirty days the collector may notify the director of revenue to suspend the motor vehicle registration for such vehicle. Any notification returned to the collector or collector-treasurer by the post office shall not result in the notification to the director of revenue for suspension of a motor vehicle registration. Thereafter, if the owner fails to timely pay such taxes the collector or collector-treasurer may notify the director of revenue of such failure. Such notification shall be on forms designed and provided by the department of revenue and shall list the motor vehicle owner's full name, including middle initial, the owner's address, and the year, make, model and vehicle identification number of such motor vehicle. Upon receipt of this notification the director of revenue may provide notice of suspension of motor vehicle registration to the owner at the owner's last address shown on the records of the department of revenue. Any suspension imposed may remain in effect until the department of revenue receives notification from a county collector or collector-treasurer that the personal property taxes have been paid in full. Upon the owner furnishing proof of payment of such taxes and paying a twenty dollar reinstatement fee to the director of revenue the motor vehicle or vehicles registration shall be reinstated. In the event a motor vehicle registration is suspended for nonpayment of personal property tax the owner so aggrieved may appeal to the circuit court of the county of his or her residence for review of such suspension at any time within thirty days after notice of motor vehicle registration suspension. Upon such appeal the cause shall be heard de novo in the manner provided by chapter 536 for the review of administrative decisions. The circuit court may order the director to reinstate such registration, sustain the suspension of registration by the director or set aside or modify such suspension. Appeals from the judgment of the circuit court may be taken as in civil cases. The prosecuting attorney of the county where such appeal is taken shall appear in behalf of the director, and prosecute or defend, as the case may require.\n\n5. Beginning July 1, 2005, a city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county may notify, by ordinary mail, any owner of a motor vehicle who is delinquent in payment of vehicle-related fees and fines that if full payment is not received within thirty days, the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county may notify the director of revenue to suspend the motor vehicle registration for such vehicle. Any notification returned to the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county by the post office shall not result in the notification to the director of revenue for suspension of a motor vehicle registration. If the vehicle-related fees and fines are assessed against a car that is registered in the name of a rental or leasing company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time the fees or fines are assessed, the rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time the fees or fines were assessed. A rental or leasing company shall not be charged for fees or fines under this subsection, nor shall the registration of a vehicle be suspended, unless prior written notice of the fees or fines has been given to that rental or leasing company by ordinary mail at the address appearing on the registration and the rental or leasing company has failed to provide the rental or lease agreement copy within fifteen days of receipt of such notice. Any notification to a rental or leasing company that is returned to the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county by the post office shall not result in the notification to the director of revenue for suspension of a motor vehicle registration. For the purpose of this section,\"vehicle-related fees and fines\"includes, but is not limited to, traffic violation fines, parking violation fines, vehicle towing, storage and immobilization fees, and any late payment penalties, other fees, and court costs associated with the adjudication or collection of those fines.\n\n6. If after notification under subsection 5 of this section the vehicle owner fails to pay such vehicle-related fees and fines to the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county within thirty days from the date of such notice, the city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county may notify the director of revenue of such failure. Such notification shall be on forms or in an electronic format approved by the department of revenue and shall list the vehicle owner's full name and address, and the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of such motor vehicle and such other information as the director shall require.\n\n7. Upon receipt of notification under subsection 5 of this section, the director of revenue may provide notice of suspension of motor vehicle registration to the owner at the owner's last address shown on the records of the department of revenue. Any suspension imposed may remain in effect until the department of revenue receives notification from a city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county that the vehicle-related fees or fines have been paid in full. Upon the owner furnishing proof of payment of such fees and fines and paying a twenty dollar reinstatement fee to the director of revenue the motor vehicle registration shall be reinstated. In the event a motor vehicle registration is suspended for nonpayment of vehicle-related fees or fines the owner so aggrieved may appeal to the circuit court of the county where the violation occurred for review of such suspension at any time within thirty days after notice of motor vehicle registration suspension. Upon such appeal the cause shall be heard de novo in the manner provided by chapter 536 for the review of administrative decisions. The circuit court may order the director to reinstate such registration, sustain the suspension of registration by the director or set aside or modify such suspension. Appeals from the judgment of the circuit court may be taken as in civil cases. The prosecuting attorney of the county where such appeal is taken shall appear in behalf of the director, and prosecute or defend, as the case may require.\n\n8. The city not within a county or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county shall reimburse the department of revenue for all administrative costs associated with the administration of subsections 5 to 8 of this section.\n\n9. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2000, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 691 §§ 1, 2, A.L. 1974 H.B. 894 & 1517, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1515, A.L. 1987 S.B. 3, A.L. 1995 S.B. 70, A.L. 1997 S.B. 316, A.L. 1998 S.B. 778, A.L. 1999 S.B. 19, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1797, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al. merged with S.B. 1394, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with H.B. 487 merged with S.B. 210)",

The director of revenue shall prescribe the forms for such fleet registration and the forms and procedures for the registration updates prescribed in this section. Any owner of ten or more motor vehicles which must be registered in accordance with this chapter may register as a fleet owner. All registered fleet owners may, at their option, register all motor vehicles included in the fleet on a calendar year or biennial basis pursuant to this section in lieu of the registration periods provided in sections 301.030, 301.035, and 301.147.

The fleet owner shall also be charged a transfer fee of two dollars for each vehicle so transferred pursuant to this subsection.\n\n4. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, all fleet vehicles registered pursuant to this section shall be issued a special license plate which shall have the words \"Fleet Vehicle\" in place of the words \"Show-Me State\" in the manner prescribed by the advisory committee established in section 301.129*. Alternatively, for a one-time additional five dollar per-vehicle fee beyond the regular registration fee, a fleet owner of at least fifty fleet vehicles may apply for fleet license plates bearing a company name or logo, the size and design thereof subject to approval by the director. All fleet license plates shall be made with fully reflective material with a common color scheme and design, shall be clearly visible at night, and shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section 301.130. Fleet vehicles shall be issued multiyear license plates as provided in this section which shall not require issuance of a renewal tab. Upon payment of appropriate registration fees, the director of revenue shall issue a registration certificate or other suitable evidence of payment of the annual or biennial fee, and such evidence of payment shall be carried at all times in the vehicle for which it is issued.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 307.350 to 307.390 to the contrary, a fleet vehicle registered in Missouri is exempt from the requirements of sections 307.350 to 307.390 if at the time of the annual fleet registration, such fleet vehicle is situated outside the state of Missouri.\n\n6. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, any person, company, or corporation engaged in the business of renting or leasing three thousand five hundred or more motor vehicles which are to be used exclusively for rental or leasing purposes and not for resale that has applied to the director of revenue for authority to operate as a lease or rental company as prescribed in section 144.070 may operate as a registered fleet owner as prescribed in the provisions of this subsection to subsection 10 of this section.\n\n(2) The director of revenue may issue license plates after presentment of an application, as designed by the director, and payment of an annual fee of three hundred sixty dollars for the first ten plates and thirty-six dollars for each additional plate. The payment and issuance of such plates shall be in lieu of registering each motor vehicle with the director as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(3) The registration fees for vehicles in the registered fleet owner's fleet shall be fully payable at the time such plates are ordered, except that when such plate is ordered after the first month of registration, the fees payable shall be prorated by the month the plates were ordered. When biennial registration is sought, an additional year's annual fee shall be added to the partial year's prorated fee.\n\n(4) Such motor vehicles within the fleet shall not be exempted from the safety inspection and emissions inspection provisions as prescribed in chapters 307 and 643, but notwithstanding the provisions of section 307.355, such inspections shall not be required to be presented to the director of revenue.\n\n7. A recipient of a lease or rental company license issued by the director of revenue as prescribed in section 144.070 operating as a registered fleet owner under this section shall register such fleet with the director of revenue on an annual or biennial basis in lieu of the individual motor vehicle registration periods as prescribed in sections 301.030, 301.035, and 301.147. If an applicant elects a biennial fleet registration, the annual fleet license plate fees prescribed in subdivision (1) of subsection 6 of this section shall be doubled. An agent fee as prescribed in subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 136.055 shall apply to the issuance of fleet registrations issued under subsections 6 to 10 of this section, and if a biennial fleet registration is elected, the agent fee shall be collected in an amount equal to the fee for two years.\n\n8. Prior to the issuance of fleet license plates under subsections 6 to 10 of this section, the applicant shall provide proof of insurance as required under section 303.024 or 303.026.\n\n9. The authority of a recipient of a lease or rental company license issued by the director of revenue as prescribed in section 144.070 to operate as a fleet owner as provided in this section shall expire on January first of the licensure period.\n\n10. A lease or rental company operating fleet license plates issued under subsections 6 to 10 of this section shall make available, upon request, to the director of revenue and all Missouri law enforcement agencies any corresponding vehicle and registration information that may be requested as prescribed by rule.\n\n11. The director shall make all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this section and shall design all necessary forms required by this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2019, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1993 S.B. 105 § 301.032 subsecs. 1 to 6, A.L. 1995 S.B. 70, A.L. 2009 H.B. 683, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1402, A.L. 2019 S.B. 89 merged with S.B. 368, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1963)\n\n*Section 301.129 was repealed by H.B. 1298 Revision, 2014",

Reciprocity agreement, registered commercial vehicles — procedures — failure to display plates, penalty — director may promulgate rules — validity of previously issued plates. —1. All commercial motor vehicles and trailers registered pursuant to this section or to be operated under reciprocity agreements shall be registered annually, or in the discretion of the state highways and transportation commission, staggered in such manner as to be registered for a one-year period beginning on the first day of a quarter during such year and in such manner as the commission may determine by regulation. To facilitate the transition from an annual registration to a staggered registration, the commission shall inquire of all registrants and registrations as to which calendar quarter the registrant wishes to use as the beginning date of the registration once the transition to staggered registration is complete. If the registrant does not respond by the date selected by the commission, or if no quarter is selected, the registrant shall remain on a calendar year registration. The commission may issue prorated registrations pursuant to this section for periods of greater than or less than one year during the transition to a nonannual year registration, but no registration shall exceed eighteen months nor be less than six months. The commission may issue a prorated, by quarter, partial year registration at any time for additions to a fleet made after an initial registration of such fleet, or such other reasons as approved by the commission or its designee upon the request of the registrant.\n\n2. An application for renewal registration pursuant to this section shall be made with all required documents on or before the first day of the month that is three calendar months immediately prior to the beginning date of the registration. Renewal applications received after the first day of the third calendar month immediately prior to the registration shall be assessed a penalty of one hundred dollars. The commission's designee may waive the penalty pursuant to this subsection for good cause.\n\n3. Fees for commercial motor vehicles and trailers renewed pursuant to this section shall be paid no later than the first day of the month that is one calendar month immediately prior to the beginning date of the registration except for payments made on an installment basis as provided in subsection 4 of this section. Renewal application fees not paid by the first day of the month immediately prior to the registration shall be assessed a penalty of fifty dollars per vehicle, but in no case shall such penalty exceed one hundred fifty dollars per application. The commission's designee may, for good cause, waive or reduce any penalties assessed pursuant to this subsection.\n\n4. Any owner of a commercial motor vehicle or trailer operated pursuant to this section or reciprocity agreements may elect to pay the Missouri portion of the annual registration fee in two equal installments, except that no such installment shall be less than one hundred dollars. The first installment shall be payable on or before the first day of the month immediately prior to the beginning date of the registration, and the second installment shall be payable on or before the first day of the sixth month of that registration one-year period. Every owner electing to pay on an installment basis shall file on or before the first day of the month immediately prior to the beginning date of the registration, a surety bond, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit as defined in section 400.5-103 to guarantee the payment of the second installment. The bond or certificate or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the payment guaranteed. The commission may require such installments to be filed at other times of the year if a nonannual registration is issued pursuant to subsection 1 of this section.\n\n5. Any applicant who fails to timely renew his or her registration with all required documents pursuant to this section or who fails to timely pay any fees and penalties owed pursuant to this section shall not be issued a temporary registration for a motor vehicle or a trailer issued pursuant to this section or under reciprocity agreements. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the issuance of temporary registration credentials for additions to the registrant's fleet subsequent to renewal.\n\n6. The applicant for registration pursuant to this section shall affix the registration plate issued to the front of the vehicle in accordance with the provisions of section 301.130. Any vehicle required to be registered pursuant to this section shall display the plate issued to that vehicle no later than December thirty-first of each year or the last day of the quarter preceding the quarter in which the registration begins, as applicable. Failure to display the registration plate required by this section shall constitute a class A misdemeanor.\n\n7. The commission may prescribe rules and regulations for the effective administration of this section.\n\n8. Any current registration or plate for which all fees have been paid for a commercial trailer previously issued pursuant to reciprocity agreements shall remain valid even if such agreements no longer require apportionment of such trailers under such agreements, and such trailers may continue to be registered pursuant to this section.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the commission shall have the authority pursuant to this chapter to issue permanent and temporary registrations on commercial trailers whether or not the registration is issued pursuant to reciprocity agreements. The provisions of subsection 1 of section 301.190 shall not apply to registrations issued pursuant to this subsection, provided the carrier or person to whom the registration is issued has at least one tractor as defined in section 301.010 registered with the state of Missouri pursuant to this section.\n\n10.

Plates removed on transfer or sale of vehicles — use by purchaser — reregistration — use of dealer plates — temporary permits, fees — credit, when — additional temporary license plate may be purchased, when — salvage vehicles, temporary permits — rulemaking authority. —1. Upon the transfer of ownership of any motor vehicle or trailer, the certificate of registration and the right to use the number plates shall expire and the number plates shall be removed by the owner at the time of the transfer of possession, and it shall be unlawful for any person other than the person to whom such number plates were originally issued to have the same in his or her possession whether in use or not, unless such possession is solely for charitable purposes; except that the buyer of a motor vehicle or trailer who trades in a motor vehicle or trailer may attach the license plates from the traded-in motor vehicle or trailer to the newly purchased motor vehicle or trailer. The operation of a motor vehicle with such transferred plates shall be lawful for no more than thirty days, or no more than ninety days if the dealer is selling the motor vehicle under the provisions of section 301.213, or no more than sixty days if the dealer is selling the motor vehicle under the provisions of subsection 5 of section 301.210. As used in this subsection, the term\"trade-in motor vehicle or trailer\"shall include any single motor vehicle or trailer sold by the buyer of the newly purchased vehicle or trailer, as long as the license plates for the trade-in motor vehicle or trailer are still valid.\n\n2. In the case of a transfer of ownership the original owner may register another motor vehicle under the same number, upon the payment of a fee of two dollars, if the motor vehicle is of horsepower, gross weight or (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, not in excess of that originally registered. When such motor vehicle is of greater horsepower, gross weight or (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, for which a greater fee is prescribed, the applicant shall pay a transfer fee of two dollars and a pro rata portion for the difference in fees. When such vehicle is of less horsepower, gross weight or (in case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, for which a lesser fee is prescribed, the applicant shall not be entitled to a refund.\n\n3. License plates may be transferred from a motor vehicle which will no longer be operated to a newly purchased motor vehicle by the owner of such vehicles. The owner shall pay a transfer fee of two dollars if the newly purchased vehicle is of horsepower, gross weight or (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, not in excess of that of the vehicle which will no longer be operated. When the newly purchased motor vehicle is of greater horsepower, gross weight or (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, for which a greater fee is prescribed, the applicant shall pay a transfer fee of two dollars and a pro rata portion of the difference in fees. When the newly purchased vehicle is of less horsepower, gross weight or (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle) seating capacity, for which a lesser fee is prescribed, the applicant shall not be entitled to a refund.\n\n4. (1) The director of the department of revenue shall have authority to produce or allow others to produce a weather resistant, nontearing temporary permit authorizing the operation of a motor vehicle or trailer by a buyer for not more than thirty days, or no more than sixty days if issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle under the provisions of subsection 5 of section 301.210, from the date of purchase. The temporary permit authorized under this section may be purchased by the purchaser of a motor vehicle or trailer from the central office of the department of revenue or from an authorized agent of the department of revenue upon satisfaction of all applicable taxes under chapter 144, upon proof of purchase of a motor vehicle or trailer for which the buyer has no registration plate available for transfer and upon proof of financial responsibility, or from a motor vehicle dealer upon purchase of a motor vehicle or trailer for which the buyer has no registration plate available for transfer, or from a motor vehicle dealer upon purchase of a motor vehicle or trailer for which the buyer has registered and is awaiting receipt of registration plates. The director of the department of revenue or a producer authorized by the director of the department of revenue may make temporary permits available to registered dealers in this state, authorized agents of the department of revenue or the department of revenue. The price paid by a motor vehicle dealer, an authorized agent of the department of revenue or the department of revenue for a temporary permit shall not exceed five dollars for each permit. The director of the department of revenue shall direct motor vehicle dealers and authorized agents to obtain temporary permits from an authorized producer. Amounts received by the director of the department of revenue for temporary permits shall constitute state revenue; however, amounts received by an authorized producer other than the director of the department of revenue shall not constitute state revenue and any amounts received by motor vehicle dealers or authorized agents for temporary permits purchased from a producer other than the director of the department of revenue shall not constitute state revenue. In no event shall revenues from the general revenue fund or any other state fund be utilized to compensate motor vehicle dealers or other producers for their role in producing temporary permits as authorized under this section. Amounts that do not constitute state revenue under this section shall also not constitute fees for registration or certificates of title to be collected by the director of the department of revenue under section 301.190. No motor vehicle dealer, authorized agent or the department of revenue shall charge more than five dollars for each permit issued. The permit shall be valid for a period of thirty days, or no more than ninety days if issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle under the provisions of section 301.213, or no more than sixty days if issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle under the provisions of subsection 5 of section 301.210, from the date of purchase of a motor vehicle or trailer, or from the date of sale of the motor vehicle or trailer by a motor vehicle dealer for which the purchaser obtains a permit as set out above. No permit shall be issued for a vehicle under this section unless the buyer shows proof of financial responsibility. Each temporary permit issued shall be securely fastened to the back or rear of the motor vehicle in a manner and place on the motor vehicle consistent with registration plates so that all parts and qualities of the temporary permit thereof shall be plainly and clearly visible, reasonably clean and are not impaired in any way.\n\n(2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection requiring satisfaction of all applicable taxes under chapter 144 shall become effective only upon notification by the director of the department of revenue that implementation of such requirements are technologically feasible following the development and maintenance of a modernized, integrated system for the titling of vehicles, the issuance and renewal of vehicle registrations, the issuance and renewal of drivers' licenses and identification cards, and the perfection and release of liens and encumbrances on vehicles.\n\n5. The permit shall be issued on a form prescribed by the director of the department of revenue and issued only for the applicant's temporary operation of the motor vehicle or trailer purchased to enable the applicant to temporarily operate the motor vehicle while proper title and registration plates are being obtained, or while awaiting receipt of registration plates, and shall be displayed on no other motor vehicle. Temporary permits issued pursuant to this section shall not be transferable or renewable, shall not be valid upon issuance of proper registration plates for the motor vehicle or trailer, and shall be returned to the department or to the department's agent upon the issuance of such proper registration plates. Any temporary permit returned to the department or to the department's agent shall be immediately destroyed. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to temporary permits issued for commercial motor vehicles licensed in excess of twenty-four thousand pounds gross weight. The director of the department of revenue shall determine the size, material, design, numbering configuration, construction, and color of the permit. The director of the department of revenue, at his or her discretion, shall have the authority to reissue, and thereby extend the use of, a temporary permit previously and legally issued for a motor vehicle or trailer while proper title and registration are being obtained.\n\n6. Every motor vehicle dealer that issues temporary permits shall keep, for inspection by proper officers, an accurate record of each permit issued by recording the permit number, the motor vehicle dealer's number, buyer's name and address, the motor vehicle's year, make, and manufacturer's vehicle identification number, and the permit's date of issuance and expiration date. Upon the issuance of a temporary permit by either the central office of the department of revenue, a motor vehicle dealer or an authorized agent of the department of revenue, the director of the department of revenue shall make the information associated with the issued temporary permit immediately available to the law enforcement community of the state of Missouri.\n\n7. Upon the transfer of ownership of any currently registered motor vehicle wherein the owner cannot transfer the license plates due to a change of motor vehicle category, the owner may surrender the license plates issued to the motor vehicle and receive credit for any unused portion of the original registration fee against the registration fee of another motor vehicle. Such credit shall be granted based upon the date the license plates are surrendered. No refunds shall be made on the unused portion of any license plates surrendered for such credit.\n\n8. An additional temporary license plate produced in a manner and of materials determined by the director to be the most cost-effective means of production with a configuration that matches an existing or newly issued plate may be purchased by a motor vehicle owner to be placed in the interior of the vehicle's rear window such that the driver's view out of the rear window is not obstructed and the plate configuration is clearly visible from the outside of the vehicle to serve as the visible plate when a bicycle rack or other item obstructs the view of the actual plate. Such temporary plate is only authorized for use when the matching actual plate is affixed to the vehicle in the manner prescribed in subsection 5 of section 301.130. The fee charged for the temporary plate shall be equal to the fee charged for a temporary permit issued under subsection 4 of this section. Replacement temporary plates authorized in this subsection may be issued as needed upon the payment of a fee equal to the fee charged for a temporary permit under subsection 4 of this section. The newly produced third plate may only be used on the vehicle with the matching plate, and the additional plate shall be clearly recognizable as a third plate and only used for the purpose specified in this subsection.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 301.217, the director may issue a temporary permit to an individual who possesses a salvage motor vehicle which requires an inspection under subsection 9 of section 301.190. The operation of a salvage motor vehicle for which the permit has been issued shall be limited to the most direct route from the residence, maintenance, or storage facility of the individual in possession of such motor vehicle to the nearest authorized inspection facility and return to the originating location. Notwithstanding any other requirements for the issuance of a temporary permit under this section, an individual obtaining a temporary permit for the purpose of operating a motor vehicle to and from an examination facility as prescribed in this subsection shall also purchase the required motor vehicle examination form which is required to be completed for an examination under subsection 9 of section 301.190 and provide satisfactory evidence that such vehicle has passed a motor vehicle safety inspection for such vehicle as required in section 307.350.\n\n10. The director of the department of revenue may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2012, shall be invalid and void.\n\n*11. The repeal and reenactment of this section shall become effective on the date the department of revenue or a producer authorized by the director of the department of revenue begins producing temporary permits described in subsection 4 of such section, or on July 1, 2013, whichever occurs first. If the director of revenue or a producer authorized by the director of the department of revenue begins producing temporary permits prior to July 1, 2013, the director of the department of revenue shall notify the revisor of statutes of such fact.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8382, A.L. 1947 V.

Otherwise, the physician or other authorized health care practitioner shall note on the statement the anticipated length of the disability, which shall determine the expiration date for the temporary windshield placard, and which period shall not exceed one hundred eighty days. If the physician or health care practitioner fails to record an expiration date on the physician's statement, the director shall issue a temporary windshield placard for a period of thirty days.\n\n5. A physician or other authorized health care practitioner who issues or signs a physician's statement so that disabled plates or a disabled windshield placard may be obtained shall maintain in such disabled person's medical chart documentation that such a certificate has been issued, the date the statement was signed, the diagnosis or condition which existed that qualified the person as disabled pursuant to this section and shall contain sufficient documentation so as to objectively confirm that such condition exists.\n\n6.

Information contained within such records shall be confidential unless required for prosecution, disciplinary purposes, or otherwise required to be disclosed by law.\n\n7. Owners of motor vehicles who are residents of the state of Missouri, and who are physically disabled, owners of motor vehicles operated at least fifty percent of the time by a physically disabled person, or owners of motor vehicles used to primarily transport physically disabled members of the owner's household may obtain disabled person license plates. Such owners, upon application to the director accompanied by the documents and fees provided for in this section, a current physician's statement which has been issued within ninety days proceeding the date the application is made, and proof of compliance with the state motor vehicle laws relating to registration and licensing of motor vehicles, shall be issued motor vehicle license plates for vehicles, other than commercial vehicles with a gross weight in excess of twenty-four thousand pounds, upon which shall be inscribed the international wheelchair accessibility symbol and the word \"DISABLED\" in addition to a combination of letters and numbers. Such license plates shall be made with fully reflective material with a common color scheme and design, shall be clearly visible at night, and shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section 301.130. If at any time an individual who obtained disabled license plates issued under this subsection no longer occupies a residence with a physically disabled person, or no longer owns a vehicle that is operated at least fifty percent of the time by a physically disabled person, such individual shall surrender the disabled license plates to the department within thirty days of becoming ineligible for their use.\n\n8. The director shall further issue, upon request, to such applicant one, and for good cause shown, as the director may define by rule and regulations, not more than two, removable disabled windshield hanging placards for use when the disabled person is occupying a vehicle or when a vehicle not bearing the permanent handicap plate is being used to pick up, deliver, or collect the physically disabled person issued the disabled motor vehicle license plate or disabled windshield hanging placard.\n\n9. No additional fee shall be paid to the director for the issuance of the special license plates provided in this section, except for special personalized license plates and other license plates described in this subsection. Priority for any specific set of special license plates shall be given to the applicant who received the number in the immediately preceding license period subject to the applicant's compliance with the provisions of this section and any applicable rules or regulations issued by the director. If determined feasible by the advisory committee established in section 301.129*, any special license plate issued pursuant to this section may be adapted to also include the international wheelchair accessibility symbol and the word \"DISABLED\" as prescribed in this section and such plate may be issued to any applicant who meets the requirements of this section and the other appropriate provision of this chapter, subject to the requirements and fees of the appropriate provision of this chapter.\n\n10. Any physically disabled person, or the parent or guardian of any such person, or any not-for-profit group, organization, or other entity which transports more than one physically disabled person, may apply to the director of revenue for a removable windshield placard. The placard may be used in motor vehicles which do not bear the permanent handicap symbol on the license plate. Such placards must be hung from the front, middle rearview mirror of a parked motor vehicle and may not be hung from the mirror during operation. These placards may only be used during the period of time when the vehicle is being used by a disabled person, or when the vehicle is being used to pick up, deliver, or collect a disabled person, and shall be surrendered to the department, within thirty days, if a group, organization, or entity that obtained the removable windshield placard due to the transportation of more than one physically disabled person no longer transports more than one disabled person. When there is no rearview mirror, the placard shall be displayed on the dashboard on the driver's side.\n\n11. The removable windshield placard shall conform to the specifications, in respect to size, color, and content, as set forth in federal regulations published by the Department of Transportation. The removable windshield placard shall be renewed every four years. The director may stagger the expiration dates to equalize workload. Only one removable placard may be issued to an applicant who has been issued disabled person license plates. Upon request, one additional windshield placard may be issued to an applicant who has not been issued disabled person license plates.\n\n12. A temporary windshield placard shall be issued to any physically disabled person, or the parent or guardian of any such person who otherwise qualifies except that the physical disability, in the opinion of the physician, is not expected to exceed a period of one hundred eighty days. The temporary windshield placard shall conform to the specifications, in respect to size, color, and content, as set forth in federal regulations published by the Department of Transportation. The fee for the temporary windshield placard shall be two dollars. Upon request, and for good cause shown, one additional temporary windshield placard may be issued to an applicant. Temporary windshield placards shall be issued upon presentation of the physician's statement provided by this section and shall be displayed in the same manner as removable windshield placards. A person or entity shall be qualified to possess and display a temporary removable windshield placard for six months and the placard may be renewed once for an additional six months if a physician's statement pursuant to this section is supplied to the director of revenue at the time of renewal.\n\n13. A windshield placard shall be renewable only by the person or entity to which the placard was originally issued. Any placard issued pursuant to this section shall only be used when the physically disabled occupant for whom the disabled plate or placard was issued is in the motor vehicle at the time of parking or when a physically disabled person is being delivered or collected. A disabled license plate and/or a removable windshield hanging placard are not transferable and may not be used by any other person whether disabled or not.\n\n14. At the time the disabled plates or windshield hanging placards are issued, the director shall issue a registration certificate which shall include the applicant's name, address, and other identifying information as prescribed by the director, or if issued to an agency, such agency's name and address. This certificate shall further contain the disabled license plate number or, for windshield hanging placards, the registration or identifying number stamped on the placard. The validated registration receipt given to the applicant shall serve as the registration certificate.\n\n15. The director shall, upon issuing any disabled registration certificate for license plates and/or windshield hanging placards, provide information which explains that such plates or windshield hanging placards are nontransferable, and the restrictions explaining who and when a person or vehicle which bears or has the disabled plates or windshield hanging placards may be used or be parked in a disabled reserved parking space, and the penalties prescribed for violations of the provisions of this act.\n\n16. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, every applicant for issuance of a disabled license plate or placard shall be required to present a new physician's statement dated no more than ninety days prior to such application, and for renewal applications a physician's statement dated no more than ninety days prior to such application shall be required every eighth year.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if the applicant has presented proof of disability in the form of a statement from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs verifying that the person is permanently disabled, the applicant shall not be required to provide a physician's statement for the purpose of issuance or renewal of disabled person license plates or windshield placards.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section, any person seventy-five years of age or older who provided a physician's statement with the original application shall not be required to provide a physician's statement for the purpose of renewal of disabled person license plates or windshield placards.\n\n17. The director of revenue upon receiving a physician's statement pursuant to this subsection shall check with the state board of registration for the healing arts created in section 334.120, or the Missouri state board of nursing established in section 335.021, with respect to physician's statements signed by advanced practice registered nurses, or the Missouri state board of chiropractic examiners established in section 331.090, with respect to physician's statements signed by licensed chiropractors, or with the board of optometry established in section 336.130, with respect to physician's statements signed by licensed optometrists, or the state board of podiatric medicine created in section 330.100, with respect to physician's statements signed by physicians of the foot or podiatrists to determine whether the physician is duly licensed and registered pursuant to law.\n\n18. The boards shall cooperate with the director and shall supply information requested pursuant to this subsection. The director shall, in cooperation with the boards which shall assist the director, establish a list of all Missouri physicians and other authorized health care practitioners and of any other information necessary to administer this section.\n\n19. Where the owner's application is based on the fact that the vehicle is used at least fifty percent of the time by a physically disabled person, the applicant shall submit a statement stating this fact, in addition to the physician's statement.

Personalized license plates, appearance, fees — new plates every three years without charge — obscene or offensive plates prohibited — amateur radio operators, plates, how marked — repossessed vehicles, placards — retired U.S. military plates, how marked. —1. The director of revenue shall establish and issue special personalized license plates containing letters or numbers or combinations of letters and numbers. Such license plates shall be made with fully reflective material with a common color scheme and design, shall be clearly visible at night, and shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section 301.130. Any person desiring to obtain a special personalized license plate for any motor vehicle the person owns, either solely or jointly, other than an apportioned motor vehicle or a commercial motor vehicle licensed in excess of twenty-four thousand pounds gross weight shall apply to the director of revenue on a form provided by the director and shall pay a fee of fifteen dollars in addition to the regular registration fees. The director of revenue shall issue rules and regulations setting the standards and establishing the procedure for application for and issuance of the special personalized license plates and shall provide a deadline each year for the applications. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001, shall be invalid and void. No two owners shall be issued identical plates. An owner shall make a new application and pay a new fee each year such owner desires to obtain or retain special personalized license plates; however, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 8 of section 301.130 to the contrary, the director shall allow the special personalized license plates to be replaced with new plates every three years without any additional charge, above the fee established in this section, to the renewal applicant. Any person currently in possession of an approved personalized license plate shall have first priority on that particular plate for each of the following years that timely and appropriate application is made.\n\n2. Upon application for a personalized plate by the owner of a motor vehicle for which the owner has no registration plate available for transfer as prescribed by section 301.140, the director shall issue a temporary permit authorizing the operation of the motor vehicle until the personalized plate is issued.\n\n3. No personalized license plates shall be issued containing any letters, numbers or combination of letters and numbers which are obscene, profane, patently offensive or contemptuous of a racial or ethnic group, or offensive to good taste or decency, or would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, of other users of streets and highways, or of the public in any location where the vehicle with such a plate may be found. The director may recall any personalized license plates, including those issued prior to August 28, 1992, if the director determines that the plates are obscene, profane, patently offensive or contemptuous of a racial or ethnic group, or offensive to good taste or decency, or would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, of other users of streets and highways, or of the public in any location where the vehicle with such a plate may be found. Where the director recalls such plates pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the director shall reissue personalized license plates to the owner of the motor vehicle for which they were issued at no charge, if the new plates proposed by the owner of the motor vehicle meet the standards established pursuant to this section. The director shall not apply the provisions of this statute in a way that violates the Missouri or United States Constitutions as interpreted by the courts with controlling authority in the state of Missouri. The primary purpose of motor vehicle license plates is to identify motor vehicles. Nothing in the issuance of a personalized license plate creates a designated or limited public forum. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit the use of license plates, which are no longer valid for registration purposes, as collector's items or for decorative purposes.\n\n4. The director may also establish categories of special license plates from which license plates may be issued. Any such person, other than a person exempted from the additional fee pursuant to subsection 7 of this section, that desires a personalized special license plate from any such category shall pay the same additional fee and make the same kind of application as that required by subsection 1 of this section, and the director shall issue such plates in the same manner as other personalized special license plates are issued.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall issue to residents of the state of Missouri who hold an unrevoked and unexpired official amateur radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission, upon application and upon payment of the additional fee specified in subsection 1 of this section, except for a person exempted from the additional fee pursuant to subsection 7 of this section, personalized special license plates bearing the official amateur radio call letters assigned by the Federal Communications Commission to the applicant with the words \"AMATEUR RADIO\" in place of the words \"SHOW-ME STATE\". The application shall be accompanied by a statement stating that the applicant has an unrevoked and unexpired amateur radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission and the official radio call letters assigned by the Federal Communications Commission to the applicant. An owner making a new application and paying a new fee to retain an amateur radio license plate may request a replacement plate with the words \"AMATEUR RADIO\" in place of the words \"SHOW-ME STATE\". If application is made to retain a plate that is three years old or older, the replacement plate shall be issued upon the payment of required fees.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, any business that repossesses motor vehicles or trailers and sells or otherwise disposes of them shall be issued a placard displaying the word \"Repossessed\", provided such business pays the license fees presently required of a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer in section 301.560. Such placard shall bear a number and shall be in such form as the director of revenue shall determine, and shall be only used for demonstrations when displayed substantially as provided for number plates on the rear of the repossessed motor vehicle or trailer.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any person who has retired from any branch of the United States Armed Forces or reserves, the United States Coast Guard or reserve, the United States Merchant Marines or reserve, the National Guard, or any subdivision of any such services shall be exempt from the additional fee required for personalized license plates issued pursuant to section 301.441. As used in this subsection,\"retired\"means having served twenty or more years in the appropriate branch of service and having received an honorable discharge.\n\n(L. 1977 H.B. 367, et al. § 2, A.L. 1979 S.B. 12, A.L. 1983 H.B. 149, et al., A.L. 1984 S.B. 505 & 471, A.L. 1989 S.B. 209, A.L. 1992 S.B. 607, A.L. 1993 S.B. 329, A.L. 1995 S.B. 3 and A.L. 1995 S.B. 70, A.L. 2001 S.B. 13, A.L. 2002 H.B. 2008, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al., A.L. 2007 S.B. 82, A.L. 2016 H.B. 2380)\n\n(1990) Where statute explicitly provides that no plate shall be issued containing any profane or obscene word or phrase, department of revenue regulation purporting to prohibit inflammatory or patently offensive words or phrases or words conflicting with overriding public policy from appearing on personalized license plates went beyond authority granted by statute and regulation was void to extent it exceeded authority in statute.

Possession of a duly issued permit shall entitle the operator of a locally licensed commercial vehicle to operate the vehicle beyond the twenty-five mile commercial zone for which licensed for the purposes set out in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3.\"Maintenance trip permit\", as used in this section, means a trip permit issued as a supplement to a local commercial license for the sole purpose of allowing the operation of a vehicle licensed as a local commercial vehicle, while empty, to or from a place of repair or maintenance within a period of ten days from the time of issuance.\n\n4. All fees collected by the director of revenue under the provisions of this section shall be deposited with the state treasurer to the credit of the state highways and transportation department fund.\n\n5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, whenever a public utility, as defined in section 386.020, has customers without utility service due to a weather-related or other type of emergency, the public utility may use locally licensed commercial vehicles to make service restoration trips to the areas of the service outages, even if such areas are outside the twenty-five-mile commercial license zone. The vehicles may operate in the areas of service outages until service is restored, and then such vehicles may make the return trip to their local area.\n\n(L. 1965 p. 469 § 1, A.L. 1989 S.B. 238)",

Certificate of registration — application, contents — special requirements, certain vehicles — fees — failure to obtain within time limit, delinquency penalty — duration of certificate — unlawful to operate without certificate — certain vehicles brought into state in a wrecked or damaged condition or after being towed, inspection — certain vehicles previously registered in other states, designation — reconstructed motor vehicles, procedure. —1. No certificate of registration of any motor vehicle or trailer, or number plate therefor, shall be issued by the director of revenue unless the applicant therefor shall make application for and be granted a certificate of ownership of such motor vehicle or trailer, or shall present satisfactory evidence that such certificate has been previously issued to the applicant for such motor vehicle or trailer. Application shall be made within thirty days after the applicant acquires the motor vehicle or trailer, unless the motor vehicle was acquired under section 301.213 or subsection 5 of section 301.210 in which case the applicant shall make application within thirty days after receiving title from the dealer, upon a blank form furnished by the director of revenue and shall contain the applicant's identification number, a full description of the motor vehicle or trailer, the vehicle identification number, and the mileage registered on the odometer at the time of transfer of ownership, as required by section 407.536, together with a statement of the applicant's source of title and of any liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or trailer, provided that for good cause shown the director of revenue may extend the period of time for making such application. When an owner wants to add or delete a name or names on an application for certificate of ownership of a motor vehicle or trailer that would cause it to be inconsistent with the name or names listed on the notice of lien, the owner shall provide the director with documentation evidencing the lienholder's authorization to add or delete a name or names on an application for certificate of ownership.\n\n2. The director of revenue shall use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether the facts stated in such application are true and shall, to the extent possible without substantially delaying processing of the application, review any odometer information pertaining to such motor vehicle that is accessible to the director of revenue. If satisfied that the applicant is the lawful owner of such motor vehicle or trailer, or otherwise entitled to have the same registered in his name, the director shall thereupon issue an appropriate certificate over his signature and sealed with the seal of his office, procured and used for such purpose. The certificate shall contain on its face a complete description, vehicle identification number, and other evidence of identification of the motor vehicle or trailer, as the director of revenue may deem necessary, together with the odometer information required to be put on the face of the certificate pursuant to section 407.536, a statement of any liens or encumbrances which the application may show to be thereon, and, if ownership of the vehicle has been transferred, the name of the state issuing the transferor's title and whether the transferor's odometer mileage statement executed pursuant to section 407.536 indicated that the true mileage is materially different from the number of miles shown on the odometer, or is unknown.\n\n3. The director of revenue shall appropriately designate on the current and all subsequent issues of the certificate the words \"Reconstructed Motor Vehicle\", \"Motor Change Vehicle\", \"Specially Constructed Motor Vehicle\", or \"Non-USA-Std Motor Vehicle\", as defined in section 301.010. Effective July 1, 1990, on all original and all subsequent issues of the certificate for motor vehicles as referenced in subsections 2 and 3 of section 301.020, the director shall print on the face thereof the following designation: \"Annual odometer updates may be available from the department of revenue.\". On any duplicate certificate, the director of revenue shall reprint on the face thereof the most recent of either:\n\n(1) The mileage information included on the face of the immediately prior certificate and the date of purchase or issuance of the immediately prior certificate; or\n\n(2) Any other mileage information provided to the director of revenue, and the date the director obtained or recorded that information.\n\n4. The certificate of ownership issued by the director of revenue shall be manufactured in a manner to prohibit as nearly as possible the ability to alter, counterfeit, duplicate, or forge such certificate without ready detection. In order to carry out the requirements of this subsection, the director of revenue may contract with a nonprofit scientific or educational institution specializing in the analysis of secure documents to determine the most effective methods of rendering Missouri certificates of ownership nonalterable or noncounterfeitable.\n\n5. The fee for each original certificate so issued shall be eight dollars and fifty cents, in addition to the fee for registration of such motor vehicle or trailer. If application for the certificate is not made within thirty days after the vehicle is acquired by the applicant, or where the motor vehicle was acquired under section 301.213 or subsection 5 of section 301.210 and the applicant fails to make application within thirty days after receiving title from the dealer, a delinquency penalty fee of twenty-five dollars for the first thirty days of delinquency and twenty-five dollars for each thirty days of delinquency thereafter, not to exceed a total of two hundred dollars, but such penalty may be waived by the director for a good cause shown. If the director of revenue learns that any person has failed to obtain a certificate within thirty days after acquiring a motor vehicle or trailer, or where the motor vehicle was acquired under section 301.213 or subsection 5 of section 301.210 and the applicant fails to make application within thirty days after receiving title from the dealer, or has sold a vehicle without obtaining a certificate, he shall cancel the registration of all vehicles registered in the name of the person, either as sole owner or as a co-owner, and shall notify the person that the cancellation will remain in force until the person pays the delinquency penalty fee provided in this section, together with all fees, charges and payments which the person should have paid in connection with the certificate of ownership and registration of the vehicle. The certificate shall be good for the life of the motor vehicle or trailer so long as the same is owned or held by the original holder of the certificate and shall not have to be renewed annually.\n\n6. Any applicant for a certificate of ownership requesting the department of revenue to process an application for a certificate of ownership in an expeditious manner requiring special handling shall pay a fee of five dollars in addition to the regular certificate of ownership fee.\n\n7. It is unlawful for any person to operate in this state a motor vehicle or trailer required to be registered under the provisions of the law unless a certificate of ownership has been applied for as provided in this section.\n\n8. Before an original Missouri certificate of ownership is issued, an inspection of the vehicle and a verification of vehicle identification numbers shall be made by the Missouri state highway patrol on vehicles for which there is a current title issued by another state if a Missouri salvage certificate of title has been issued for the same vehicle but no prior inspection and verification has been made in this state, except that if such vehicle has been inspected in another state by a law enforcement officer in a manner comparable to the inspection process in this state and the vehicle identification numbers have been so verified, the applicant shall not be liable for the twenty-five dollar inspection fee if such applicant submits proof of inspection and vehicle identification number verification to the director of revenue at the time of the application. The applicant, who has such a title for a vehicle on which no prior inspection and verification have been made, shall pay a fee of twenty-five dollars for such verification and inspection, payable to the director of revenue at the time of the request for the application, which shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the state highways and transportation department fund.\n\n9. Each application for an original Missouri certificate of ownership for a vehicle which is classified as a reconstructed motor vehicle, specially constructed motor vehicle, kit vehicle, motor change vehicle, non-USA-std motor vehicle, or other vehicle as required by the director of revenue shall be accompanied by a vehicle examination certificate issued by the Missouri state highway patrol, or other law enforcement agency as authorized by the director of revenue. The vehicle examination shall include a verification of vehicle identification numbers and a determination of the classification of the vehicle. The owner of a vehicle which requires a vehicle examination certificate shall present the vehicle for examination and obtain a completed vehicle examination certificate prior to submitting an application for a certificate of ownership to the director of revenue. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, an owner presenting a motor vehicle which has been issued a salvage title and which is ten years of age or older to a vehicle examination described in this subsection in order to obtain a certificate of ownership with the designation prior salvage motor vehicle shall not be required to repair or restore the vehicle to its original appearance in order to pass or complete the vehicle examination. The fee for the vehicle examination application shall be twenty-five dollars and shall be collected by the director of revenue at the time of the request for the application and shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the state highways and transportation department fund. If the vehicle is also to be registered in Missouri, the safety inspection required in chapter 307 and the emissions inspection required under chapter 643 shall be completed and the fees required by section 307.365 and section 643.315 shall be charged to the owner.\n\n10. When an application is made for an original Missouri certificate of ownership for a motor vehicle previously registered or titled in a state other than Missouri or as required by section 301.020, it shall be accompanied by a current inspection form certified by a duly authorized official inspection station as described in chapter 307. The completed form shall certify that the manufacturer's identification number for the vehicle has been inspected, that it is correctly displayed on the vehicle and shall certify the reading shown on the odometer at the time of inspection. The inspection station shall collect the same fee as authorized in section 307.365 for making the inspection, and the fee shall be deposited in the same manner as provided in section 307.365. If the vehicle is also to be registered in Missouri, the safety inspection required in chapter 307 and the emissions inspection required under chapter 643 shall be completed and only the fees required by section 307.365 and section 643.315 shall be charged to the owner. This section shall not apply to vehicles being transferred on a manufacturer's statement of origin.\n\n11. Motor vehicles brought into this state in a wrecked or damaged condition or after being towed as an abandoned vehicle pursuant to another state's abandoned motor vehicle procedures shall, in lieu of the inspection required by subsection 10 of this section, be inspected by the Missouri state highway patrol in accordance with subsection 9 of this section. If the inspection reveals the vehicle to be in a salvage or junk condition, the director shall so indicate on any Missouri certificate of ownership issued for such vehicle. Any salvage designation shall be carried forward on all subsequently issued certificates of title for the motor vehicle.\n\n12. When an application is made for an original Missouri certificate of ownership for a motor vehicle previously registered or titled in a state other than Missouri, and the certificate of ownership has been appropriately designated by the issuing state as a reconstructed motor vehicle, motor change vehicle, specially constructed motor vehicle, or prior salvage vehicle, the director of revenue shall appropriately designate on the current Missouri and all subsequent issues of the certificate of ownership the name of the issuing state and such prior designation. The absence of any prior designation shall not relieve a transferor of the duty to exercise due diligence with regard to such certificate of ownership prior to the transfer of a certificate. If a transferor exercises any due diligence with regard to a certificate of ownership, the legal transfer of a certificate of ownership without any designation that is subsequently discovered to have or should have had a designation shall be a transfer free and clear of any liabilities of the transferor associated with the missing designation.\n\n13. When an application is made for an original Missouri certificate of ownership for a motor vehicle previously registered or titled in a state other than Missouri, and the certificate of ownership has been appropriately designated by the issuing state as non-USA-std motor vehicle, the director of revenue shall appropriately designate on the current Missouri and all subsequent issues of the certificate of ownership the words \"Non-USA-Std Motor Vehicle\".\n\n14. The director of revenue and the superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol shall make and enforce rules for the administration of the inspections required by this section.\n\n15. Each application for an original Missouri certificate of ownership for a vehicle which is classified as a reconstructed motor vehicle, manufactured forty or more years prior to the current model year, and which has a value of three thousand dollars or less shall be accompanied by:\n\n(1) A proper affidavit submitted by the owner explaining how the motor vehicle or trailer was acquired and, if applicable, the reasons a valid certificate of ownership cannot be furnished;\n\n(2) Photocopies of receipts, bills of sale establishing ownership, or titles, and the source of all major component parts used to rebuild the vehicle;\n\n(3) A fee of one hundred fifty dollars in addition to the fees described in subsection 5 of this section. Such fee shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the state highways and transportation department fund; and\n\n(4) An inspection certificate, other than a motor vehicle examination certificate required under subsection 9 of this section, completed and issued by the Missouri state highway patrol, or other law enforcement agency as authorized by the director of revenue. The inspection performed by the highway patrol or other authorized local law enforcement agency shall include a check for stolen vehicles.\n\n­­The department of revenue shall issue the owner a certificate of ownership designated with the words \"Reconstructed Motor Vehicle\" and deliver such certificate of ownership in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Notwithstanding subsection 9 of this section, no owner of a reconstructed motor vehicle described in this subsection shall be required to obtain a vehicle examination certificate issued by the Missouri state highway patrol.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8382, A.L. 1947 V.

Any person who purchases or is the owner of real property on which vehicles, as defined in section 301.010, vessels or watercraft, as defined in section 306.010, or outboard motors, as that term is used in section 306.530, have been abandoned, without the consent of said purchaser or owner of the real property, may apply to the department of revenue for a certificate of title. Any insurer which purchases a vehicle through the claims adjustment process for which the insurer is unable to obtain a negotiable title may make an application to the department of revenue for a salvage certificate of title pursuant to this section. Prior to making application for a certificate of title on a vehicle under this section, the insurer or owner of the real estate shall have the vehicle inspected by law enforcement pursuant to subsection 9 of section 301.190, and shall have law enforcement perform a check in the national crime information center and any appropriate statewide law enforcement computer to determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen and the name and address of the person to whom the vehicle was last titled and any lienholders of record. The insurer or owner or purchaser of the real estate shall, thirty days prior to making application for title, notify any owners or lienholders of record for the vehicle by certified mail that the owner intends to apply for a certificate of title from the director for the abandoned vehicle.

Upon receipt of the application and supporting documents, the director shall search the records of the department of revenue, or initiate an inquiry with another state, if the evidence presented indicated the property described in the application was registered or titled in another state, to verify the name and address of any owners and any lienholders. If the latest owner or lienholder was not notified the director shall inform the insurer, owner, or purchaser of the real estate of the latest owner and lienholder information so that notice may be given as required by subsection 1 of this section. Any owner or lienholder receiving notification may protest the issuance of title by, within the thirty-day or forty-five-day notice period, as applicable, and may file a petition to recover the vehicle, naming the insurer described in subsection 1, 3, or 6 of this section, as applicable; a salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler described in subsection 4 of this section; a used motor vehicle dealer described in subsection 5 of this section; or the owner of the real estate and serving a copy of the petition on the director of revenue.

Upon receipt of the application and supporting documents, the director shall search the records of the department of revenue to verify the name and address of any owners and any lienholders. If the director identifies any additional owner or lienholder who has not been notified by the insurer, the director shall inform the insurer of such additional owner or lienholder and the insurer shall notify the additional owner or lienholder of the insurer's intent to obtain title as prescribed in this section. If no valid lienholders have notified the department of the existence of a lien, the department shall issue a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate for the vehicle in the name of the insurer.\n\n4. Any salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler that takes possession of a vehicle at the request of an insurer when the insurer does not purchase the vehicle through the claims adjustment process may apply to the department for a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate in the name of the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler if the vehicle has remained unclaimed on the salvage pool's or salvage dealer and dismantler's premises for more than forty-five days. The salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler shall, forty-five days prior to making application for title, notify any owners or lienholders of record for the vehicle that the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler intends to apply to the director for a certificate of title for the vehicle unless the owner or lienholder removes the vehicle from the salvage pool's or salvage dealer and dismantler's premises within the forty-five days. The application for title shall be on a form provided by the department, signed under penalty of perjury, and shall be accompanied by:\n\n(1) A statement explaining the circumstances by which the vehicle came into the salvage pool's or salvage dealer and dismantler's possession; a description of the vehicle including the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number; the current location of the property; and the fee prescribed in subsection 5 of section 301.190;\n\n(2) A copy of the forty-five-day notice and certified mail receipt mailed, or proof that the request was delivered by a nationally recognized courier service, to any owner and any person holding a valid security interest of record; and\n\n(3) If the vehicle is not currently titled in Missouri, an inspection report of the vehicle by a law enforcement agency pursuant to subsection 9 of section 301.190.\n\n­­Upon receipt of the application and supporting documents, the director shall search the records of the department, or initiate an inquiry with another state if the evidence presented indicated the property described in the application was registered or titled in another state, to verify the name and address of any owners and any lienholders. If the director identifies any additional owner or lienholder who has not been notified by the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler, the director shall inform the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler of such additional owner or lienholder and the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler shall notify the additional owner or lienholder of the salvage pool's or salvage dealer and dismantler's intent to obtain title as prescribed in this section. If no valid lienholders have notified the department of the existence of a lien, the department shall issue a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate for the vehicle in the name of the salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler.\n\n5. Any used motor vehicle dealer that takes possession of a vehicle at the request of an organization exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code when such organization does not provide the used motor vehicle dealer with a negotiable title may apply to the department of revenue for a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate in the name of the used motor vehicle dealer if the vehicle has remained unclaimed on the used motor vehicle dealer's premises for more than forty-five days. The used motor vehicle dealer shall, forty-five days prior to making application for title, notify any owners or lienholders of record for the vehicle that the used motor vehicle dealer intends to apply for a certificate of title from the director for the vehicle unless the owner or lienholder removes the vehicle from the used motor vehicle dealer's premises within the forty-five days. The application for title shall be on a form provided by the department, signed under penalty of perjury, and shall be accompanied by:\n\n(1) A statement explaining the circumstances by which the vehicle came into the used motor vehicle dealer's possession; a description of the vehicle including the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number; the current location of the property; and the fee prescribed in subsection 5 of section 301.190;\n\n(2) A copy of the forty-five-day notice and certified mail receipt mailed, or proof that the request was delivered by a nationally recognized courier service, to any owner and any person holding a valid security interest of record; and\n\n(3) If the vehicle is not currently titled in Missouri, an inspection report of the vehicle by a law enforcement agency pursuant to subsection 9 of section 301.190.\n\n­­Upon receipt of the application and supporting documents, the director shall search the records of the department, or initiate an inquiry with another state if the evidence presented indicated the property described in the application was registered or titled in another state, to verify the name and address of any owners and any lienholders. If the director identifies any additional owner or lienholder who has not been notified by the used motor vehicle dealer, the director shall inform the used motor vehicle dealer of such additional owner or lienholder and the used motor vehicle dealer shall notify the additional owner or lienholder of the used motor vehicle dealer's intent to obtain title as prescribed in this section. If no valid lienholders have notified the department of the existence of a lien, the department shall issue a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate for the vehicle in the name of the used motor vehicle dealer.\n\n6. Any insurer that purchases a vessel or watercraft that is currently titled in Missouri through the claims adjustment process and for which the insurer is unable to obtain a negotiable title may make application to the department for a certificate of title. Such application may be made by the insurer or its designated salvage pool or salvage dealer and dismantler on a form provided by the department and signed under penalty of perjury. The application shall include a declaration that the insurer has made at least two written attempts to obtain the certificate of title, transfer documents, or other acceptable evidence of title and be accompanied by proof of claims payment from the insurer; evidence that letters were sent to the vessel or watercraft owner; a statement explaining the circumstances by which the property came into the insurer's possession; a description of the property including the year, make, and hull identification number; the current location of the property; and the fee prescribed in subsection 3 of section 306.015. The insurer shall, thirty days prior to making application for title, notify any owners or lienholders of record for the vessel or watercraft that the insurer intends to apply to the director for a certificate of title for the vessel or watercraft. Upon receipt of the application and supporting documents, the director shall search the records of the department of revenue to verify the name and address of any owners and any lienholders. If the director identifies any additional owner or lienholder who has not been notified by the insurer, the director shall inform the insurer of such additional owner or lienholder and the insurer shall notify the additional owner or lienholder of the insurer's intent to obtain title as prescribed in this section. If no valid lienholders have notified the department of the existence of a lien, the department shall issue a certificate of title for the vessel or watercraft in the name of the insurer.\n\n(L. 2002 H.B. 1075, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al., A.L. 2012 H.B. 1150 merged with S.B. 568, A.L. 2013 H.B. 428 merged with S.B. 148, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1963)",

The buyer shall then present such certificate, assigned as aforesaid, to the director of revenue, at the time of making application for the registration of such motor vehicle or trailer, whereupon a new certificate of ownership shall be issued to the buyer, the fee therefor being that prescribed in subsection 5 of section 301.190.\n\n3.

(1) A motor vehicle dealer licensed under sections 301.550 to 301.580 may deliver a motor vehicle or trailer to a purchaser with a written agreement to pass the certificate of ownership with an assignment to the purchaser within thirty days after delivery, inclusive of weekends and holidays.\n\n(2) The form of the agreement shall be prescribed by the director of revenue. The agreement shall provide that if the motor vehicle dealer does not pass the certificate of ownership with an assignment to the purchaser within thirty days that the sale shall be voidable at purchaser's option and, in such case, dealer shall repurchase the vehicle by paying and satisfying in full any purchase money lien against the vehicle, including accrued penalties and fees, with the remainder of one hundred percent of the sale price refunded and paid by the dealer to the buyer. As used in this subdivision, the term\"sale price\"shall include the negotiated price of the vehicle, the down payment, the trade-in allowance even if the allowance reflected negative equity, and the price of all optional services and products sold to the buyer under the sales and finance transaction.\n\n(3) In the event a motor vehicle subject to this subsection has suffered physical damage covered by the purchaser's vehicle insurance policy and the vehicle is determined by the insurance company to be a total loss, the insurance company may satisfy the claim in full, with respect to the damage to the vehicle, by transferring all proceeds to such purchaser and any secured lienholder of record. The purchaser shall not assign the purchaser's corresponding insurance benefits to any party without the express written permission of the insurer. In conjunction with such satisfaction of the claim, if as part of such claim settlement the insurance company is to receive the vehicle under subdivision (4) of this subsection, but clear title never vests with the purchaser within the thirty-day period after the date of sale prescribed by subdivision (2) of this subsection or within ten days of the claim settlement date, whichever is later, the insurance company shall notify the dealer that clear title never vested with the purchaser and the dealer shall reimburse the insurance company for the salvage value of such vehicle as determined in the claims settlement with the purchaser, and in exchange the insurance company shall assign its rights to the vehicle back to the dealer. If the dealer fails to make payment to the insurance company within fifteen days of receiving notice, the dealer shall be liable to the insurance company for the value of the salvage as determined in the claims settlement with the purchaser, plus any actual damages and any applicable court costs, in return for the right to acquire the title and apply for a salvage title under this chapter.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, completion of the requirements of this subsection shall constitute prima facie evidence of an ownership interest vested in the purchaser of the vehicle for all purposes other than for a subsequent transfer of ownership of the vehicle by the purchaser, subject to the rights of any secured lienholder of record; however, the purchaser may use a dealer-supplied copy of the agreement to transfer his or her ownership of the vehicle to an insurance company in situations where the vehicle has been declared salvage or a total loss by the insurance company as a result of a settlement of a claim. Such insurance company may apply for a salvage certificate of title or junking certificate under subsection 3 of section 301.193 in order to transfer its interest in such vehicle. The purchaser may also use a dealer-supplied copy of the agreement on the form prescribed by the director of revenue as proof of ownership interest. Any lender or insurance company may rely upon a copy of the signed written agreement on the form prescribed by the director of revenue as proof of ownership interest. Any lien placed upon a vehicle based upon such signed written agreement shall be valid and enforceable, notwithstanding the absence of a certificate of ownership.\n\n(5) No motor vehicle dealer shall be authorized under this subsection to enter and have outstanding any such written agreements until such dealer has provided to the director of revenue a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars in a form which complies with the requirements of section 301.560 and in lieu of the fifty thousand dollar bond otherwise required for licensure as a motor vehicle dealer.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8382, A.L. 1947 V.

If the dealer complies with the requirements of subsection 1 of this section, the sale or trade of the vehicle to the dealer shall be considered final, subject to any existing liens created and perfected under sections 301.600 to 301.660. Once the prior owner of the motor vehicle has physically delivered the motor vehicle to the licensed dealer, the prior owners' insurable interest in such vehicle shall cease to exist.\n\n3. If a licensed dealer complies with the requirements of subsection 1 of this section, and such dealer has provided to the director of revenue a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit in amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars in a form which complies with the requirements of section 301.560 and in lieu of the fifty thousand dollar bond otherwise required for licensure as a motor vehicle dealer, such dealer may sell such vehicle prior to receiving and assigning to the purchaser the certificate of ownership, provided such dealer complies with the following:\n\n(1) All outstanding liens created on the vehicle pursuant to sections 301.600 to 301.660 have been paid in full, and the dealer provides a copy of proof or other evidence to the purchaser; and\n\n(2) The dealer has obtained proof or other evidence from the department of revenue confirming that no outstanding child support liens exist upon the vehicle at the time of sale and provides a copy of said proof or other evidence to the purchaser; and\n\n(3) The dealer has obtained proof or other evidence from the department of revenue confirming that all applicable state sales tax has been satisfied on the sale of the vehicle to the previous owner and provides a copy of said proof or other evidence to the purchaser; and\n\n(4) The dealer has signed an application for duplicate or replacement title for the vehicle under subsection 4 of section 301.300 and provides a copy of the application to the purchaser, along with a copy of the power of attorney required by subsection 1 of this section, and the dealer has prepared and delivered to the purchaser an application for title for the vehicle in the purchaser's name; and\n\n(5) The dealer and the purchaser have entered into a written agreement for the subsequent assignment and delivery of such certificate of ownership, on a form prescribed by the director of revenue, to take place at a time, not to exceed sixty calendar days, after the time of delivery of the motor vehicle to the purchaser.

Following a sale or other transaction in which a certificate of ownership has not been assigned from the owner to the licensed dealer, the dealer shall, within ten business days, apply for a duplicate or replacement certificate of ownership. Upon receipt of a duplicate or replacement certificate of ownership applied for under subsection 4 of section 301.300, the dealer shall assign and deliver said certificate of ownership to the purchaser of the vehicle within five business days.

If the dealer cannot be found by the purchaser after making reasonable attempts, or if the dealer fails to assign and deliver the duplicate or replacement certificate of ownership to the purchaser by the date agreed upon by the dealer and the purchaser, as required by subsection 4 of this section, then the purchaser may deliver to the director a copy of the contract for sale of the vehicle, a copy of the application for duplicate title provided by the dealer to the purchaser, a copy of the secure power of attorney allowing the dealer to assign the duplicate title, and the proof or other evidence obtained by the purchaser from the dealer under subsection 3 of this section. Thereafter, the director shall mail by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice to the dealer at the last address given to the department by that dealer. That notice shall inform the dealer that the director intends to cancel any prior certificate of title which may have been issued to the dealer on the vehicle and issue to the purchaser a certificate of title in the name of the purchaser, subject to any liens incurred by the purchaser in connection with the purchase of the vehicle, unless the dealer, within ten business days from the date of the director's notice, files with the director a written objection to the director taking such action. If the dealer does file a timely, written objection with the director, then the director shall not take any further action without an order from a court of competent jurisdiction. However, if the dealer does not file a timely, written objection with the director, then the director shall cancel the prior certificate of title issued to the dealer on the vehicle and issue a certificate of title to the purchaser of the vehicle, subject to any liens incurred by the purchaser in connection with the purchase of the vehicle and subject to the purchaser satisfying all applicable taxes and fees associated with registering the vehicle.\n\n7. If a seller misrepresents to a dealer that the seller is the owner of a vehicle and the dealer, the owner, any subsequent purchaser, or any prior or subsequent lienholder is thereby damaged, then the seller shall be liable to each such party for actual and punitive damages, plus court costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n\n8. When a lienholder is damaged as a result of a licensed dealer's acts, errors, omissions, or violations of this section, then the dealer shall be liable to the lienholder for actual damages, plus court costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n\n9. No court costs or attorney fees shall be awarded under this section unless, prior to filing any such action, the following conditions have been met:\n\n(1) The aggrieved party seeking damages has delivered an itemized written demand of the party's actual damages to the party from whom damages are sought; and\n\n(2) The party from whom damages are sought has not satisfied the written demand within thirty days after receipt of the written demand.\n\n10. The department of revenue may use a dealer's repeated or intentional violation of this section as a cause to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew any license required pursuant to sections 301.550 to 301.580, in addition to the causes set forth in section 301.562. The hearing process shall be the same as that established in subsection 6 of section 301.562.\n\n11. No dealer shall enter into a contract under this section after December 31, 2020. Any contract entered into prior to December 31, 2020, shall be enforceable as provided in this section.

Certificate of title on repossession under mortgage, issuance — contents — application — notice — rulemaking authority. —1. When the holder of any indebtedness secured by a security agreement or other contract for security covering a motor vehicle or trailer, who has a notice of lien on file with the director of revenue, repossesses the motor vehicle or trailer either by legal process or in accordance with the terms of a contract authorizing the repossession of the vehicle without legal process, the holder may obtain a certificate of ownership from the director of revenue upon presentation of:\n\n(1) An application form furnished by the director of revenue that shall contain a full description of the motor vehicle or trailer and the manufacturer's or other identifying number;\n\n(2) A notice of lien receipt or the original certificate of ownership reflecting the holder's lien; and\n\n(3) An affidavit of the holder, certified under penalties of perjury for making a false statement to a public official, that the debtor defaulted in payment of the debt, and that the holder repossessed the motor vehicle or trailer either by legal process or in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the specific address where the vehicle or trailer is held. Such affidavit shall also state that the lienholder has the written consent from all owners or lienholders of record to repossess the vehicle or has provided all the owners or lienholders with written notice of the repossession.\n\n2. On a motor vehicle or trailer, the lienholder shall first give:\n\n(1) Ten days' written notice by first class United States mail postage prepaid to each of the owners and other lienholders, if any, of the motor vehicle or trailer at each of their last mailing addresses as shown by the last prior certificate of ownership, if any issued, or the most recent address on the lienholder's records, that an application for a repossessed title will be made; or\n\n(2) The lienholder may, ten days prior to applying for a repossession title, include the information in the above notice in the appropriate uniform commercial code notice under sections 400.9-613 or 400.9-614. Such alternative notice to all owners and lienholders shall be valid and enforceable under both the uniform commercial code and this section, provided it otherwise complies with the provisions of the uniform commercial code.\n\n3. Upon the holder's presentation of the papers required by subsection 1 of this section and the payment of a fee of ten dollars, the director of revenue, if he is satisfied with the genuineness of the papers, shall issue and deliver to the holder a certificate of ownership which shall be in its usual form except it shall be clearly captioned \"Repossessed Title\". Each repossessed title so issued shall, for all purposes, be treated as an original certificate of ownership and shall supersede the outstanding certificate of ownership, if any, and duplicates thereof, if any, on the motor vehicle or trailer, all of which shall become null and void.\n\n4. In any case where there is no certificate of ownership or duplicate thereof outstanding in the name of the debtor on the repossessed motor vehicle or trailer, the director of revenue shall issue a repossessed title to the holder and shall proceed to collect all unpaid fees, taxes, charges and penalties from the debtor as provided in section 301.190.\n\n5. The director of revenue may prescribe rules and regulations for the effective administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2005, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 618, A.L. 1965 pp. 114, 470, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1045, A.L. 1989 H.B. 211, A.L. 2005 H.B. 487, A.L. 2006 S.B. 892)\n\n(1974) Repossession proceedings under this section held not to involve sufficient state action to authorize cause of action under federal civil rights act.

However, if the insurance company upon recovery of a stolen vehicle determines that the stolen vehicle has not sustained damage to the extent that the vehicle would have otherwise been declared a salvage vehicle pursuant to section 301.010, then the insurance company may have the vehicle inspected by the Missouri state highway patrol, or other law enforcement agency authorized by the director of revenue, in accordance with the inspection provisions of subsection 9 of section 301.190. Upon receipt of title application, applicable fee, the completed inspection, and the return of any previously issued negotiable salvage certificate, the director shall issue an original title with no salvage or prior salvage designation. Upon the issuance of an original title the director shall remove any indication of the negotiable salvage title previously issued to the insurance company from the department's electronic records.\n\n9. Notwithstanding subsection 4 of this section or any other provision of the law to the contrary, if a motor vehicle is inoperable and is at least ten model years old, or the parts are from a motor vehicle that is inoperable and is at least ten model years old, a scrap metal operator may purchase or acquire such motor vehicle or parts without receiving the original certificate of ownership, salvage certificate of title, or junking certificate from the seller of the vehicle or parts, provided the scrap metal operator verifies with the department of revenue, via the department's online record access, that the motor vehicle is not subject to any recorded security interest or lien and the scrap metal operator complies with the requirements of this subsection. In lieu of forwarding certificates of title or ownership for such motor vehicles as required by subsection 5 of this section, the scrap metal operator shall forward a copy of the seller's state identification card along with a bill of sale to the department of revenue. The bill of sale form shall be designed by the director and such form shall include, but not be limited to, a certification that the motor vehicle is at least ten model years old, is inoperable, is not subject to any recorded security interest or lien, and a certification by the seller that the seller has the legal authority to sell or otherwise transfer the seller's interest in the motor vehicle or parts. Upon receipt of the information required by this subsection, the department of revenue shall cancel any certificate of title or ownership and registration for the motor vehicle. If the motor vehicle is inoperable and at least twenty model years old, then the scrap metal operator shall not be required to verify with the department of revenue whether the motor vehicle is subject to any recorded security interests or liens. As used in this subsection, the term\"inoperable\"means a motor vehicle that is in a rusted, wrecked, discarded, worn out, extensively damaged, dismantled, and mechanically inoperative condition and the vehicle's highest and best use is for scrap purposes. The director of the department of revenue is directed to promulgate rules and regulations to implement and administer the provisions of this section, including but not limited to, the development of a uniform bill of sale. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2012, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 78 § 9, A.L. 1983 H.B. 149, et al., A.L. 1984 S.B. 648 Revision, H.B. 1045, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1367 & 1573, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1581, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1279, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al., A.L. 2007 S.B. 82, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1150, A.L. 2015 H.B. 686, A.L. 2017 S.B. 8 merged with S.B. 222 merged with S.B. 225)\n\n*Section 301.572 was repealed in 1997 by H.B. 207.",

Each monthly sales report filed by a motor vehicle dealer who collects sales tax under subsection 10 of section 144.070 shall also include the amount of state and local sales tax collected for each motor vehicle sold if sales tax was due. The odometer reading is not required when reporting the sale of any motor vehicle that is twenty years old or older, any motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than sixteen thousand pounds, new vehicles that are transferred on a manufacturer's statement of origin between one franchised motor vehicle dealer and another, or boats, all-terrain vehicles or trailers.

The monthly sales report shall include a statement of motor vehicles or trailers sold during the month under subsection 5 of section 301.210. The monthly sales report shall be completed in full and signed by an officer, partner, or owner of the dealership, and actually received by the department of revenue on or before the fifteenth day of the month succeeding the month for which the sales are being reported. If no sales occur in any given month, a report shall be submitted for that month indicating no sales. Any vehicle dealer who fails to file a monthly report or who fails to file a timely report shall be subject to disciplinary action as prescribed in section 301.562 or a penalty assessed by the director not to exceed three hundred dollars per violation. Every motor vehicle and boat dealer shall retain copies of the monthly sales report as part of the records to be maintained at the dealership location and shall hold them available for inspection by appropriate law enforcement officials and officials of the department of revenue. Every vehicle dealer selling twenty or more vehicles a month shall file the monthly sales report with the department in an electronic format. Any dealer filing a monthly sales report in an electronic format shall be exempt from filing the notice of transfer required by section 301.196. For any dealer not filing electronically, the notice of transfer required by section 301.196 shall be submitted with the monthly sales report as prescribed by the director.\n\n2. Every dealer and every person operating a public garage shall keep a correct record of the vehicle identification number, odometer setting, manufacturer's name of all motor vehicles or trailers accepted by him for the purpose of sale, rental, storage, repair or repainting, together with the name and address of the person delivering such motor vehicle or trailer to the dealer or public garage keeper, and the person delivering such motor vehicle or trailer shall record such information in a file kept by the dealer or garage keeper. The record shall be kept for five years and be open for inspection by law enforcement officials, members or authorized or designated employees of the Missouri highway patrol, and persons, agencies and officials designated by the director of revenue.\n\n3. Every dealer and every person operating a public garage in which a motor vehicle remains unclaimed for a period of fifteen days shall, within five days after the expiration of that period, report the motor vehicle as unclaimed to the director of revenue. Such report shall be on a form prescribed by the director of revenue. A motor vehicle left by its owner whose name and address are known to the dealer or his employee or person operating a public garage or his employee is not considered unclaimed. Any dealer or person operating a public garage who fails to report a motor vehicle as unclaimed as herein required forfeits all claims and liens for its garaging, parking or storing.\n\n4. The director of revenue shall maintain appropriately indexed cumulative records of unclaimed vehicles reported to the director. Such records shall be kept open to public inspection during reasonable business hours.\n\n5. The alteration or obliteration of the vehicle identification number on any such motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of larceny, and the dealer or person operating such public garage shall upon the discovery of such obliteration or alteration immediately notify the highway patrol, sheriff, marshal, constable or chief of police of the municipality where the dealer or garage keeper has his place of business, and shall hold such motor vehicle or trailer for a period of forty-eight hours for the purpose of an investigation by the officer so notified.\n\n6. Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or omission of a material fact in a monthly sales report to the department of revenue, as described in subsection 1 of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8381, A.L. 1974 H.B. 985, A.L. 1983 S.B. 9, A.L. 1984 S.B. 656, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1367 & 1573, A.L. 1988 H.B. 990, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1279, A.L. 1993 S.B. 35, A.L. 1997 H.B. 207, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al., A.L. 2007 S.B. 82, A.L. 2009 H.B. 683, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1402, A.L. 2015 H.B. 686, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1963, A.L. 2021 S.B. 262)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 7773; 1919 §§ 7568, 7605",

A motor vehicle dealer, trailer dealer, boat dealer, or powersport dealer may charge an administrative fee in connection with the sale or lease of a new or used motor vehicle, trailer, vessel, or vessel trailer for the storage of documents or any other administrative or clerical services not prohibited by this section. A portion of the administrative fee may result in profit to the motor vehicle dealer, trailer dealer, boat dealer, or powersport dealer.\n\n*3. (1) Ten percent of any fee authorized under this section and charged by motor vehicle dealers or trailer dealers shall be remitted to the motor vehicle administration technology fund established in this subsection, for the development of the system specified in this subsection. Following the development of the system specified in this subsection, the director of the department of revenue shall notify motor vehicle dealers and trailer dealers, and implement the system, and the percentage of any fee authorized under this section required to be remitted to the fund shall be reduced to three and one-half percent, which shall be used for maintenance of the system.

The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund and money in the fund shall be used solely by the department of revenue for the purpose of development and maintenance of a modernized, integrated system for the titling of vehicles, issuance and renewal of vehicle registrations, issuance and renewal of driver's licenses and identification cards, and perfection and release of liens and encumbrances on vehicles.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the general revenue fund.\n\n(4) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as other funds are invested.

The maximum administrative fee permitted under this subsection shall be increased annually by an amount equal to the percentage change in the annual average of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or its successor index, as reported by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, or by zero, whichever is greater. The director of the department of revenue shall annually furnish the maximum administrative fee determined under this section to the secretary of state, who shall publish such value in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable after January fourteenth of each year.\n\n5.

The general assembly believes that an administrative fee charged in compliance with this section is not the unauthorized practice of law or the unauthorized business of law so long as the activity or service for which the fee is charged is in compliance with the provisions of this section and does not result in the waiver of any rights or remedies. Recognizing, however, that the judiciary is the sole arbitrator of what constitutes the practice of law, in the event that a court determines that an administrative fee charged in compliance with this section, and that does not waive any rights or remedies of the buyer, is the unauthorized practice of law or the unauthorized business of law, then no person who paid that administrative fee may recover said fee or treble damages, as permitted under section 484.020, and no person who charged that fee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, as provided under section 484.020.\n\n(L. 2009 S.B. 355, A.L. 2021 S.B. 176, A.L. 2025 S.B. 28)\n\n*Subsection 3 expires 1-01-37.",

In addition to the application forms prescribed by the department, each applicant shall submit the following to the department:\n\n(1) Every application other than a renewal application for a motor vehicle franchise dealer shall include a certification that the applicant has a bona fide established place of business. Such application shall include an annual certification that the applicant has a bona fide established place of business for the first three years and only for every other year thereafter. The certification shall be performed by a uniformed member of the Missouri state highway patrol or authorized or designated employee stationed in the troop area in which the applicant's place of business is located; except that in counties of the first classification, certification may be performed by an officer of a metropolitan police department when the applicant's established place of business of distributing or selling motor vehicles or trailers is in the metropolitan area where the certifying metropolitan police officer is employed. When the application is being made for licensure as a boat manufacturer or boat dealer, certification shall be performed by a uniformed member of the Missouri state highway patrol or authorized or designated employee stationed in the troop area in which the applicant's place of business is located or, if the applicant's place of business is located within the jurisdiction of a metropolitan police department in a first class county, by an officer of such metropolitan police department. A bona fide established place of business for any new motor vehicle franchise dealer, used motor vehicle dealer, boat dealer, powersport dealer, wholesale motor vehicle dealer, trailer dealer, or wholesale or public auction shall be a permanent enclosed building or structure, either owned in fee or leased and actually occupied as a place of business by the applicant for the selling, bartering, trading, servicing, or exchanging of motor vehicles, boats, personal watercraft, or trailers and wherein the public may contact the owner or operator at any reasonable time, and wherein shall be kept and maintained the books, records, files and other matters required and necessary to conduct the business.

Dealers who sell only emergency vehicles as defined in section 301.550 are exempt from maintaining a bona fide place of business, including the related law enforcement certification requirements, and from meeting the minimum yearly sales;\n\n(2) The initial application for licensure shall include a photograph, not to exceed eight inches by ten inches but no less than five inches by seven inches, showing the business building, lot, and sign. A new motor vehicle franchise dealer applicant who has purchased a currently licensed new motor vehicle franchised dealership shall be allowed to submit a photograph of the existing dealership building, lot and sign but shall be required to submit a new photograph upon the installation of the new dealership sign as required by sections 301.550 to 301.580.

The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be conditioned upon the dealer complying with the provisions of the statutes applicable to new motor vehicle franchise dealers, used motor vehicle dealers, powersport dealers, wholesale motor vehicle dealers, trailer dealers, and boat dealers, and the bond shall be an indemnity for any loss sustained by reason of the acts of the person bonded when such acts constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the dealer's license. The bond shall be executed in the name of the state of Missouri for the benefit of all aggrieved parties or the irrevocable letter of credit shall name the state of Missouri as the beneficiary; except, that the aggregate liability of the surety or financial institution to the aggrieved parties shall, in no event, exceed the amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit. Additionally, every applicant as a new motor vehicle franchise dealer, a used motor vehicle dealer, a powersport dealer, a wholesale motor vehicle dealer, or boat dealer shall furnish with the application a copy of a current dealer garage policy bearing the policy number and name of the insurer and the insured. The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit furnished by an applicant shall be paid upon receipt by the department of a final judgment from a Missouri court of competent jurisdiction against the principal and in favor of an aggrieved party. The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit furnished by an applicant shall be paid at the order of the department and in the amount determined by the department to any buyer or interested lienholder up to the greater of the amount required for the release of the purchase money lien or the sales price paid by the buyer where a dealer has failed to fulfill the dealer's obligations under an agreement to assign and deliver title to the buyer within thirty days under a contract entered into pursuant to subsection 5 of section 301.210. The department shall direct release of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit proceeds upon presentation of a written agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 5 of section 301.210, copies of the associated sales and finance documents, and the affidavit or affidavits of the buyer or lienholder stating that the certificate of title with assignment thereof has not been passed to the buyer within thirty days of the date of the contract entered into under subsection 5 of section 301.210, that the dealer has not fulfilled the agreement under the contract to repurchase the vehicle, that the buyer or the lienholder has notified the dealer of the claim on the bond or letter of credit, and the amount claimed by the purchaser or lienholder. In addition, prior to directing release and payment of the proceeds of a bond or irrevocable letter of credit, the department shall ensure that there is satisfactory evidence to establish that the vehicle which is subject to the written agreement has been returned by the buyer to the dealer or that the buyer has represented to the department that the buyer will surrender possession of the vehicle to the dealer upon payment of the proceeds of the bond or letter of credit directed by the department. Excepting ordinary wear and tear or mechanical failures not caused by the buyer, the amount of proceeds to be paid to the buyer under the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to any damage, abuse, or destruction incurred by the vehicle while the vehicle was in the buyer's possession as agreed between the buyer and the dealer. The dealer may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to contest the claim on the bond or letter of credit, including the amount of the claim and the amount of any adjustment for any damage, abuse, or destruction, by filing a petition with the court within thirty days of the notification by the buyer or lienholder. If the dealer does not fulfill the agreement or file a petition to request judicial relief from the terms of the agreement or contest the amount of the claim, the bond or letter of credit shall be released by the department and directed paid in the amount or amounts presented by the lienholder or buyer;\n\n(4) Payment of all necessary license fees as established by the department. In establishing the amount of the annual license fees, the department shall, as near as possible, produce sufficient total income to offset operational expenses of the department relating to the administration of sections 301.550 to 301.580. All fees payable pursuant to the provisions of sections 301.550 to 301.580, other than those fees collected for the issuance of dealer plates or certificates of number collected pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, shall be collected by the department for deposit in the state treasury to the credit of the \"Motor Vehicle Commission Fund\", which is hereby created. The motor vehicle commission fund shall be administered by the Missouri department of revenue. The provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, money in such fund shall not be transferred and placed to the credit of the general revenue fund until the amount in the motor vehicle commission fund at the end of the biennium exceeds two times the amount of the appropriation from such fund for the preceding fiscal year or, if the department requires permit renewal less frequently than yearly, then three times the appropriation from such fund for the preceding fiscal year. The amount, if any, in the fund which shall lapse is that amount in the fund which exceeds the multiple of the appropriation from such fund for the preceding fiscal year.\n\n2. In the event a new vehicle manufacturer, boat manufacturer, motor vehicle dealer, wholesale motor vehicle dealer, boat dealer, powersport dealer, wholesale motor vehicle auction, trailer dealer, or a public motor vehicle auction submits an application for a license for a new business and the applicant has complied with all the provisions of this section, the department shall make a decision to grant or deny the license to the applicant within eight working hours after receipt of the dealer's application, notwithstanding any rule of the department.\n\n3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6 of this section, upon the initial issuance of a license by the department, the department shall assign a distinctive dealer license number or certificate of number to the applicant and the department shall issue one number plate or certificate bearing the distinctive dealer license number or certificate of number and two additional number plates or certificates of number within eight working hours after presentment of the application and payment by the applicant of a fee of fifty dollars for the first plate or certificate and ten dollars and fifty cents for each additional plate or certificate.

The issuance of such distinctive dealer license number or certificate of number shall be in lieu of registering each motor vehicle, trailer, vessel or vessel trailer dealt with by a boat dealer, boat manufacturer, manufacturer, public motor vehicle auction, wholesale motor vehicle dealer, wholesale motor vehicle auction or new or used motor vehicle dealer. The license plates described in this section shall be made with fully reflective material with a common color scheme and design, shall be clearly visible at night, and shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section 301.130.\n\n*4. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, the department shall assign the following distinctive dealer license numbers to:\n\n­­For purposes of this subsection, qualified transactions shall include the purchase of salvage titled vehicles by a licensed salvage dealer. A used motor vehicle dealer who also holds a salvage dealer's license shall be allowed one additional plate or certificate number per fifty-unit qualified transactions annually.

The provisions of this subsection shall become effective on the date the director of the department of revenue begins to reissue new license plates under section 301.130, or on December 1, 2008, whichever occurs first. If the director of revenue begins reissuing new license plates under the authority granted under section 301.130 prior to December 1, 2008, the director of the department of revenue shall notify the revisor of statutes of such fact.\n\n5. Upon the sale of a currently licensed motor vehicle dealership the department shall, upon request, authorize the new approved dealer applicant to retain the selling dealer's license number and shall cause the new dealer's records to indicate such transfer. If the new approved dealer applicant elects not to retain the selling dealer's license number, the department shall issue the new dealer applicant a new dealer's license number and an equal number of plates or certificates as the department had issued to the selling dealer.\n\n6. In the case of motor vehicle dealers, the department shall issue one number plate bearing the distinctive dealer license number and may issue one additional number plate to the applicant upon payment by the dealer of a fifty dollar fee for the number plate bearing the distinctive dealer license number and ten dollars and fifty cents for the additional number plate.

In the case of new motor vehicle manufacturers, powersport dealers, recreational motor vehicle dealers, and trailer dealers, the department shall issue one number plate bearing the distinctive dealer license number and may issue two additional number plates to the applicant upon payment by the manufacturer or dealer of a fifty dollar fee for the number plate bearing the distinctive dealer license number and ten dollars and fifty cents for each additional number plate. Boat dealers and boat manufacturers shall be entitled to one certificate of number bearing such number upon the payment of a fifty dollar fee. Additional number plates and as many additional certificates of number may be obtained upon payment of a fee of ten dollars and fifty cents for each additional plate or certificate. New motor vehicle manufacturers shall not be issued or possess more than three hundred forty-seven additional number plates or certificates of number annually. New and used motor vehicle dealers, powersport dealers, wholesale motor vehicle dealers, boat dealers, and trailer dealers are limited to one additional plate or certificate of number per ten-unit qualified transactions annually. New and used recreational motor vehicle dealers are limited to two additional plates or certificate of number per ten-unit qualified transactions annually for their first fifty transactions and one additional plate or certificate of number per ten-unit qualified transactions thereafter. An applicant seeking the issuance of an initial license shall indicate on his or her initial application the applicant's proposed annual number of sales in order for the director to issue the appropriate number of additional plates or certificates of number. A motor vehicle dealer, trailer dealer, boat dealer, powersport dealer, recreational motor vehicle dealer, motor vehicle manufacturer, boat manufacturer, or wholesale motor vehicle dealer obtaining a distinctive dealer license plate or certificate of number or additional license plate or additional certificate of number, throughout the calendar year, shall be required to pay a fee for such license plates or certificates of number computed on the basis of one-twelfth of the full fee prescribed for the original and duplicate number plates or certificates of number for such dealers' licenses, multiplied by the number of months remaining in the licensing period for which the dealer or manufacturers shall be required to be licensed. In the event of a renewing dealer, the fee due at the time of renewal shall not be prorated. Wholesale and public auctions shall be issued a certificate of dealer registration in lieu of a dealer number plate. In order for dealers to obtain number plates or certificates under this section, dealers shall submit to the department of revenue on August first of each year a statement certifying, under penalty of perjury, the dealer's number of sales during the reporting period of July first of the immediately preceding year to June thirtieth of the present year.\n\n7.

The plates issued pursuant to subsection 3 or 6 of this section may be displayed on any motor vehicle or trailer owned and held for resale by a motor vehicle dealer for use by a customer who is test driving the motor vehicle, for use by any customer while the customer's vehicle is being serviced or repaired by the motor vehicle dealer, for use and display purposes during, but not limited to, parades, private events, charitable events, or for use by an employee or officer, but shall not be displayed on any motor vehicle or trailer hired or loaned to others or upon any regularly used service or wrecker vehicle. Motor vehicle dealers may display their dealer plates on a tractor, truck or trailer to demonstrate a vehicle under a loaded condition. Trailer dealers may display their dealer license plates in like manner, except such plates may only be displayed on trailers owned and held for resale by the trailer dealer.\n\n8.

Except as provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for a motor vehicle dealer to sell or offer to sell any motor vehicle away from the dealer's registered place of business. It shall not be a violation of this section for a motor vehicle dealer to deliver a motor vehicle to a customer for a test drive away from the dealer's registered place of business; deliver documents to a customer to sign away from the dealer's registered place of business; deliver documents to, or obtain documents from, a customer away from the dealer's registered place of business; or deliver a motor vehicle to a customer away from the dealer's registered place of business.\n\n2. The sale of vehicles at off-site sales shall be limited to sales by a seller of vehicles used and titled solely in its ordinary course of business, and such sales shall be held in conjunction with a credit union and limited to members of the credit union, thus constituting a private sale to be advertised to members only.\n\n3.

A recreational vehicle dealer licensed in another state may participate in a vehicle show or exhibition in Missouri which has, when it opens to the public, at least fifty dealers displaying recreational vehicles if the show or exhibition is trade-oriented and is predominantly funded by recreational vehicle manufacturers. All of the participating dealers who are not licensed in Missouri shall be licensed as recreational vehicle dealers by the state of their residence.\n\n8. A recreational vehicle dealer licensed in another state who intends to participate in a vehicle show or exhibition in this state shall send written notification of such intended participation to the department of revenue at least thirty days prior to the vehicle show or exhibition. Upon receipt of such written notification, the department of revenue shall make a determination regarding compliance with the provisions of this section. If such recreational vehicle dealer would be unable to participate in the vehicle show or exhibition in this state pursuant to this section, the department of revenue shall notify the recreational vehicle dealer at least fifteen days prior to the vehicle show or exhibition of the inability to participate in the vehicle show or exhibition in this state.\n\n9.

In addition, in advertisements placed by individual dealers and not line-make marketing groups, the advertised price or credit terms shall include all charges which the buyer must pay to the dealer, except buyer-selected options and state and local taxes. If a processing fee or freight or destination charges are not included in the advertised price, the amount of any such processing fee and freight or destination charge must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed within the advertisement;\n\n(8) Advertisements of dealer rebates shall not be used, however, this shall not be deemed to prohibit the advertising of manufacturer rebates, so long as all material terms of such rebates are clearly and conspicuously disclosed;\n\n(9) \"Free\" or \"at no cost\" shall not be used if any purchase is required to qualify for the free item, merchandise, or service;\n\n(10) Bait advertising, in which an advertiser may have no intention to sell at the prices or terms advertised, shall not be used.

Subject to the provisions of section 301.620, a lien or encumbrance on a motor vehicle or trailer is perfected by the delivery to the director of revenue of a notice of a lien in a format as prescribed by the director of revenue. The notice of lien is perfected as of the time of its creation if the delivery of such notice to the director of revenue is completed within thirty days thereafter, otherwise as of the time of the delivery. A notice of lien shall contain the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle or trailer and the secured party, a description of the motor vehicle or trailer, including the vehicle identification number, and such other information as the department of revenue may prescribe.

By rules and regulations, the director of revenue shall establish a security procedure for the purpose of verifying that an electronic notice of lien or notice of satisfaction of a lien on a motor vehicle or trailer given as permitted in sections 301.600 to 301.640 is that of the lienholder, verifying that an electronic notice of confirmation of ownership and perfection of a lien given as required in section 301.610 is that of the director of revenue, and detecting error in the transmission or the content of any such notice.

An organization applying for specialty plates shall authorize the use of its official emblem to be affixed on multiyear personalized license plates within the plate area prescribed by the director of revenue and as provided in this section. Any contribution to the organization derived from the emblem-use contribution, except reasonable administrative costs, shall be used solely for the purposes of the organization. Any member of the organization or nonmember, if applicable, may annually apply for the use of the emblem, if applicable.\n\n10. The department shall begin production and distribution of each new specialty license plate within one year after approval of the specialty license plate by the joint committee on transportation oversight.\n\n11. The department shall issue a specialty license plate to the owner who meets the requirements for issuance of the specialty plate for any motor vehicle such owner owns, either solely or jointly, other than an apportioned motor vehicle or a commercial motor vehicle licensed in excess of twenty-four thousand pounds gross weight.\n\n12. Each new or renewed application for an approved specialty license plate shall be made to the department of revenue, accompanied by an additional fee of fifteen dollars and the appropriate emblem-use authorization statement.\n\n13. The appropriate registration fees, fifteen dollar specialty plate fee, processing fees and documents otherwise required for the issuance of registration of the motor vehicle as set forth by law must be submitted at the time the specialty plates are actually issued and renewed or as otherwise provided by law. However, no additional fee for the personalization of this plate shall be charged.\n\n14. Once a specialty plate design is approved, a request for such plate may be made any time during a registration period. If a request is made for a specialty license plate to replace a current valid license plate, all documentation, credits, and fees provided for in this chapter when replacing a current license plate shall apply.\n\n15. A vehicle owner who was previously issued a plate with an organization emblem authorized by this section, but who does not provide an emblem-use authorization statement at a subsequent time of registration if required, shall be issued a new plate which does not bear the organization's emblem, as otherwise provided by law.\n\n16. Specialty license plates shall bear a design approved by the organization submitting the original application for approval by the joint committee on transportation oversight. The design shall be within the plate area prescribed by the director of revenue, and the designated organization's name or slogan shall be in place of the words \"SHOW-ME STATE\". Such license plates shall be made with fully reflective material with a common color scheme, shall be clearly visible at night, shall have a reflective white background in the area of the plate configuration, and shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section 301.130 and as provided in this section. In addition to a design, the specialty license plates shall be in accordance with criteria and plate design set forth in this chapter.\n\n17. The department is authorized to discontinue the issuance and renewal of a specialty license plate if the organization has stopped providing services and emblem-use authorization statements are no longer being issued by the organization. Such organizations shall notify the department immediately to discontinue the issuance of a specialty plate.\n\n18. The organization that requested the specialty license plate shall not redesign the specialty personalized license plate unless such organization pays the director in advance all redesigned plate fees. All plate holders of such plates must pay the replacement fees prescribed in section 301.300 for the replacement of the existing specialty plate. All other applicable license plate fees in accordance with this chapter shall be required.\n\n(L. 2004 S.B. 1233, et al., A.L. 2012 S.B. 480 merged with S.B. 563, A.L. 2016 H.B. 2380)",
