Definitions — maximum speed limits — cities, towns, villages, certain counties, may set speed limit, how set — slower speeds set, when — violations, penalty. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Expressway\", a divided highway of at least ten miles in length with four or more lanes which is not part of the federal interstate system of highways which has crossovers or accesses from streets, roads or other highways at the same grade level as such divided highway;\n\n(2)\"Freeway\", a limited access divided highway of at least ten miles in length with four or more lanes which is not part of the federal interstate system of highways which does not have any crossovers or accesses from streets, roads or other highways at the same grade level as such divided highway within such ten miles of divided highway;\n\n(3)\"Rural interstate\", that part of the federal interstate highway system that is not located in an urban area;\n\n(4)\"Urbanized area\", an area of fifty thousand population at a density at or greater than one thousand persons per square mile.\n\n2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the uniform maximum speed limits are and no vehicle shall be operated in excess of the speed limits established pursuant to this section:\n\n(1) Upon the rural interstates and freeways of this state, seventy miles per hour;\n\n(2) Upon the rural expressways of this state, sixty-five miles per hour;\n\n(3) Upon the interstate highways, freeways or expressways within the urbanized areas of this state, sixty miles per hour;\n\n(4) All other roads and highways in this state not located in an urbanized area and not provided for in subdivisions (1) to (3) of this subsection, sixty miles per hour;\n\n(5) All other roads provided for in subdivision (4) of this subsection shall not include any state two-lane road which is identified by letter. Such lettered roads shall not exceed fifty-five miles per hour unless set at a higher speed as established by the department of transportation, except that no speed limit shall be set higher than sixty miles per hour;\n\n(6) For the purposes of enforcing the speed limit laws of this state, it is a rebuttable presumption that the posted speed limit is the legal speed limit.\n\n3. On any state road or highway where the speed limit is not set pursuant to a local ordinance, the highways and transportation commission may set a speed limit higher or lower than the uniform maximum speed limit provided in subsection 2 of this section, if a higher or lower speed limit is recommended by the department of transportation. The department of public safety, where it believes for safety reasons, or to expedite the flow of traffic a higher or lower speed limit is warranted, may request the department of transportation to raise or lower such speed limit, except that no speed limit shall be set higher than seventy miles per hour.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 304.120 or any other provision of law to the contrary, cities, towns and villages may regulate the speed of vehicles on state roads and highways within such cities', towns' or villages' corporate limits by ordinance with the approval of the state highways and transportation commission. Any reduction of speed in cities, towns or villages shall be designed to expedite the flow of traffic on such state roads and highways to the extent consistent with public safety. The commission may declare any ordinance void if it finds that such ordinance is:\n\n(1) Not primarily designed to expedite traffic flow; and\n\n(2) Primarily designed to produce revenue for the city, town or village which enacted such ordinance.\n\n­­If an ordinance is declared void, the city, town or village shall have any future proposed ordinance approved by the highways and transportation commission before such ordinance may take effect.\n\n5. The county commission of any county of the second, third or fourth classification may set the speed limit or the weight limit or both the speed limit and the weight limit on roads or bridges on any county, township or road district road in the county and, with the approval of the state highways and transportation commission, on any state road or highway not within the limits of any incorporated city, town or village, lower than the uniform maximum speed limit as provided in subsection 2 of this section where the condition of the road or the nature of the area requires a lower speed. The maximum speed limit set by the county commission of any county of the second, third, or fourth classification for any road under the commission's jurisdiction shall not exceed fifty-five miles per hour if such road is properly marked by signs indicating such speed limit. If the county commission does not mark the roads with signs indicating the speed limit, the speed limit shall be fifty miles per hour. The commission shall send copies of any order establishing a speed limit or weight limit on roads and bridges on a county, township or road district road in the county to the chief engineer of the state department of transportation, the superintendent of the state highway patrol and to any township or road district maintaining roads in the county. After the roads have been properly marked by signs indicating the speed limits and weight limits set by the county commission, the speed limits and weight limits shall be of the same effect as the speed limits provided for in subsection 1 of this section and shall be enforced by the state highway patrol and the county sheriff as if such speed limits and weight limits were established by state law.\n\n6. The county commission of any county of the second, third, or fourth classification may by ordinance set a countywide speed limit on roads within unincorporated areas of any county, township, or road district in the county and may establish reasonable speed regulations for motor vehicles within the limit of such county. No person who is not a resident of such county and who has not been within the limits thereof for a continuous period of more than forty-eight hours shall be convicted of a violation of such ordinances, unless it is shown by competent evidence that there was posted at the place where the boundary of such county road enters the county a sign displaying in black letters not less than four inches high and one inch wide on a white background the speed fixed by such county so that such signs may be clearly seen by operators and drivers from their vehicles upon entering such county. The commission shall send copies of any order establishing a countywide speed limit on a county, township, or road district road in the county to the chief engineer of the Missouri department of transportation, the superintendent of the state highway patrol, and to any township or road district maintaining roads in the county. After the boundaries of the county roads entering the county have been properly marked by signs indicating the speed limits set by the county commission, the speed limits shall be of the same effect as the speed limits provided for in subsection 1 of this section and shall be enforced by the state highway patrol and the county sheriff as if such speed limits were established by state law.\n\n7. All road signs indicating speed limits or weight limits shall be uniform in size, shape, lettering and coloring and shall conform to standards established by the department of transportation.\n\n8. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to alter any speed limit set below fifty-five miles per hour by any ordinance of any county, city, town or village of the state adopted before March 13, 1996.\n\n9. The speed limits established pursuant to this section shall not apply to the operation of any emergency vehicle as defined in section 304.022.\n\n10. A violation of the provisions of this section shall not be construed to relieve the parties in any civil action on any claim or counterclaim from the burden of proving negligence or contributory negligence as the proximate cause of any accident or as the defense to a negligence action.\n\n11. Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a class C misdemeanor, unless such person was exceeding the posted speed limit by twenty miles per hour or more then it is a class B misdemeanor.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8383, A.L. 1957 p. 631, A.L. 1965 pp. 95, 594, A.L. 1969 H.B. 46 & 483, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1297, A.L. 1979 S.B. 44, A.L. 1985 H.B. 288, et al. merged with S.B. 408, A.L. 1987 S.B. 83, A.L. 1991 H.B. 25, A.L. 1995 H.B. 717, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1047, A.L. 2004 H.B. 795, et al.)\n\n(1960) A railroad track itself is a warning of danger and a highway traveler must exercise the highest degree of care in crossing the track. A motorist approaching a railroad crossing with which he is familiar who fails to look or to see that which is plainly visible if he performs his duty to look, is contributorily negligent. Pipes v. Mo. Pacific Railroad Co. (Mo.), 338 S.W.2d 30.\n\n(1960) Where information used some of the language of the statute in charging careless and reckless driving and went on to particularized saying that the vehicle was operated at a high rate of speed, weaving back and forth across the road and running through city stop signs, while not recommended for future use, held sufficient as an information. State v. Tevis (A.), 340 S.W.2d 415.\n\n(1961) Operator of motor vehicle about to drive across railroad tracks on which a train is approaching is required to exercise the highest degree of care for his own safety. Reedy v. Missouri -Kansas-Texas Ry. Co. (Mo.), 347 S.W.2d 111.\n\n(1961) Every operator of a motor vehicle has a duty to exercise the highest degree of care and such care includes the warning of other motorists on the highway while the vehicle is stopped on the paved portion of the road after the vehicle had stalled and ceased to run. Phillips v. Stockman (A.), 351 S.W.2d 464.\n\n(1961) On trial for violating speed regulations under this section evidence as to prior conviction of offense committed subsequent to the offense for which the accused was on trial held admissible in evidence. State v. Hunt (A.), 352 S.W.2d 57.\n\n(1962) Wife, seated in right front seat of car her husband left parked with the motor running, who in moving over to make room for another occupant accidentally stepped on accelerator causing car to lunge forward and crash through store, injuring plaintiff, became operator of the car within meaning of statute. Hay v. Ham (A.), 364 S.W.2d 118.\n\n(1965) This section is designed to prevent danger and it is unnecessary for the state to show that any specific person was actually put in danger in order to sustain a conviction. State v. McNail (A.), 389 S.W.2d 214.\n\n(1965) Information failing to state that offense occurred on a highway did not charge a crime. State v. Bartlett (A.), 394 S.W.2d 434.\n\n(1966) Duty of a motorist to use the highest degree of care is not limited to the paved portion of a highway, but extends to the shoulder of the highway. Ely v. Parsons (A.), 399 S.W.2d 613.\n\n(1966) To fulfill his statutory duty to exercise the highest degree of care at all times and to keep a careful and vigilant lookout for other persons and vehicles on the highway, a motorist is required to look in such an observant manner as to enable him to see that which a person in the exercise of the highest degree of care would be expected to see under similar circumstances, and he must be held to have seen what looking would have revealed. Weathers v. Falstaff Brewing Corp. (A.), 403 S.W.2d 663.\n\n(1968) Failure to yield the right-of-way is specifically denounced as an offense, but an information charging careless and imprudent driving by failure to yield the right-of-way at a place where required by statute to do so, includes the offense as descriptive of what happened and in what manner defendant drove imprudently. State v. Richards (A.), 429 S.W.2d 351.\n\n(1971) Information failing to state that offense occurred on a highway did not charge a crime. State v. Rollins (A.), 469 S.W.2d 46.\n\n(1972) To constitute careless and imprudent driving there must be conduct which shows under all the existing circumstances and conditions that the property of another or the life or limb of any person is endangered; therefore, evidence that defendant spun his car around two or three times in intersection, making tires squeal and throwing rocks, was insufficient to support conviction of the offense. State v. Todd (A.), 477 S.W.2d 725.\n\n(1977) This section does not impose a duty to exercise the highest degree of care to save all persons from harm proximately resulting from operation of motor vehicles. Ford v. Monroe (A.), 559 S.W.2d 759.\n\n(1984) Offense of careless and imprudent driving is not the \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes as a manslaughter charge. State v. Noerper (Mo. App.E.D.), 674 S.W.2d 100.\n\n(1984) Director of revenue may not assess points for speeding violations on state limited access highways within city limits, if the city ordinance violates, duplicates or concurs with the state set limits. Knierim v. James (Mo. banc), 677 S.W.2d 322.\n\n(1990) Motorist stopped on roadway to repair an automobile is considered to be \"operating\" an automobile within the provision requiring the highest degree of care. Phillips v. United States, 743 F.Supp. 681 (E.D.Mo.).\n\n(1993) Where high speed chase by law enforcement officers resulted in one civilian death and substantial property damage and personal injury to others, statute that provides some regulations for operation of emergency vehicles does not create duty to particular individuals as distinguished from general public; therefore duty created is to public and not to individuals. Boyle v. City of Liberty, Mo., 833 F.Supp. 1436 (W.D. Mo.).",

Upon all public roads or highways of sufficient width a vehicle shall be driven upon the right half of the roadway, except as follows:\n\n(1) When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction pursuant to the rules governing such movement;\n\n(2) When placing a vehicle in position for and when such vehicle is lawfully making a left turn in compliance with the provisions of sections 304.014 to 304.025 or traffic regulations thereunder or of municipalities;\n\n(3) When the right half of a roadway is closed to traffic while under construction or repair;\n\n(4) Upon a roadway designated by local ordinance as a one-way street and marked or signed for one-way traffic.\n\n3. It is unlawful to drive any vehicle upon any highway or road which has been divided into two or more roadways by means of a physical barrier or by means of a dividing section or delineated by curbs, lines or other markings on the roadway, except to the right of such barrier or dividing section, or to make any left turn or semicircular or U-turn on any such divided highway, except at an intersection or interchange or at any signed location designated by the state highways and transportation commission or the department of transportation. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to emergency vehicles, law enforcement vehicles or to vehicles owned by the commission or the department.\n\n4. The authorities in charge of any highway or the state highway patrol may erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in a particular direction, regardless of the center line of the highway, and all members of the Missouri highway patrol and other peace officers may direct traffic in conformance with such signs. When authorized signs have been erected designating off-center traffic lanes, no person shall disobey the instructions given by such signs.\n\n5. Whenever any roadway has been divided into three or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, the following rules in addition to all others consistent herewith shall apply:\n\n(1) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety;\n\n(2) Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway ahead is clearly visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation for a left turn or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is sign-posted to give notice of such allocation;\n\n(3) Upon all highways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic thereon shall be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right-hand edge or curb, except as otherwise provided in sections 304.014 to 304.025;\n\n(4) Official signs may be erected by the highways and transportation commission or the highway patrol may place temporary signs directing slow-moving traffic to use a designated lane or allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same direction and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such sign;\n\n(5) Drivers of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right, and except when a roadway has been divided into traffic lanes, each driver shall give to the other at least one-half of the main traveled portion of the roadway whenever possible.\n\n6. All vehicles in motion upon a highway having two or more lanes of traffic proceeding in the same direction shall be driven in the right-hand lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle or when preparing to make a proper left turn or when otherwise directed by traffic markings, signs or signals.\n\n7. All trucks registered for a gross weight of more than forty-eight thousand pounds shall not be driven in the far left-hand lane upon all interstate highways, freeways, or expressways within urbanized areas of the state having three or more lanes of traffic proceeding in the same direction. This restriction shall not apply when:\n\n(1) It is necessary for the operator of the truck to follow traffic control devices that direct use of a lane other than the right lane; or\n\n(2) The right half of a roadway is closed to traffic while under construction or repair.\n\n8. As used in subsection 7 of this section,\"truck\"means any vehicle, machine, tractor, trailer, or semitrailer, or any combination thereof, propelled or drawn by mechanical power and designed for or used in the transportation of property upon the highways. The term \"truck\" also includes a commercial motor vehicle as defined in section 301.010.\n\n9. Violation of this section shall be deemed a class C misdemeanor unless such violation causes an immediate threat of an accident, in which case such violation shall be deemed a class B misdemeanor, or unless an accident results from such violation, in which case such violation shall be deemed a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(L. 1953 p. 587 § 304.020, A.L. 1971 H.B. 110, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1047, A.L. 2001 S.B. 244, A.L. 2008 S.B. 930 & 947, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1540)\n\n(1960) Under the 1953 statute a motorist is not required to operate his automobile \"as close to the right hand side of the highway as is practicable\".

Nelson, 277 F.2d 207.\n\n(1961) Where motor vehicle skidded on icy pavement and stopped blocking part of highway on grade below crest of hill, operator properly engaged in moving the vehicle rather than going to top of hill to warn other motorists since her car could be seen for a distance of 325 feet. Eastman v. Brackman (Mo.), 347 S.W.2d 126.\n\n(1965) Unexplained skidding of a vehicle into left half of roadway is not ipso facto negligence. It leaves open the question of negligence. Wray v. King (A.), 385 S.W.2d 831.\n\n(1965) This section does not require vehicle to make use of part of road which is in fact impassable and unavailable for travel, and motorist may be excused from statutory violation where he deviates from prescribed course of travel in order to avoid a dangerous obstruction. Tiner v. Hill (A.), 394 S.W.2d 425.\n\n(1967) Purpose of this section is to change common law rule that one had the right to use either side of highway if way was unobstructed. This section does not create a motorist's duty to a pedestrian to avoid driving to the right of the right half of the roadway. Skiles v. Schlake (Mo.), 421 S.W.2d 244.\n\n(1973) Backing road grader in southerly direction on northbound lane of highway held not to constitute driving on wrong side of road. Bounds v.

A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds twenty-four inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen feet, which limit of fourteen feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles.

The crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five feet six inches from the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices described in subsection 2 of this section. This subsection may be cited as \"Jessica's Law\" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri schoolchildren who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.\n\n4. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the state board of education, to communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district shall have the authority pursuant to this section to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four or more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution, and in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due caution.\n\n5. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at any location upon a highway consisting of four or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a speed limit greater than sixty miles per hour and at least three hundred feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.\n\n6. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, or which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway containing four or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.\n\n7. The driver of any school bus driving upon the highways of this state after loading or unloading school children, shall remain stopped if the bus is followed by three or more vehicles, until such vehicles have been permitted to pass the school bus, if the conditions prevailing make it safe to do so.\n\n8. If any vehicle is witnessed by a peace officer or the driver of a school bus to have violated the provisions of this section and the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person in whose name such vehicle is registered committed the violation. In the event that charges are filed against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one of the owners may be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one of the owners. If the vehicle which is involved in the violation is registered in the name of a rental or leasing company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the peace officer or prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time of the violation. No prosecuting authority may bring any legal proceedings against a rental or leasing company under this section unless prior written notice of the violation has been given to that rental or leasing company by registered mail at the address appearing on the registration and the rental or leasing company has failed to provide the rental or lease agreement copy within fifteen days of receipt of such notice.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the provisions in section 301.130, every school bus shall be required to have two license plates.\n\n(L. 1949 p. 329 § 1, A.L. 1958 2d Ex.

After ascertaining the name and address of the owner and lienholder, if any, the department shall, within fifteen working days, notify the towing company. Any towing company which comes into possession of abandoned property pursuant to section 304.155 or 304.157 and who claims a lien for recovering, towing or storing abandoned property shall give notice to the title owner and to all persons claiming a lien thereon, as disclosed by the records of the department of revenue or of a corresponding agency in any other state.

A towing company may only assess reasonable storage charges for abandoned property towed without the consent of the owner. Reasonable storage charges shall not exceed the charges for vehicles which have been towed with the consent of the owner on a negotiated basis. Storage charges may be assessed only for the time in which the towing company complies with the procedural requirements of sections 304.155 to 304.158.\n\n3. In the event that the records of the department of revenue fail to disclose the name of the owner or any lienholder of record, the department shall notify the towing company which shall attempt to locate documents or other evidence of ownership on or within the abandoned property itself. The towing company must certify that a physical search of the abandoned property disclosed that no ownership documents were found and a good faith effort has been made. For purposes of this section,\"good faith effort\"means that the following checks have been performed by the company to establish the prior state of registration and title:\n\n(1) Check of the abandoned property for any type of license plates, license plate record, temporary permit, inspection sticker, decal or other evidence which may indicate a state of possible registration and title;\n\n(2) Check the law enforcement report for a license plate number or registration number if the abandoned property was towed at the request of a law enforcement agency;\n\n(3) Check the tow ticket/report of the tow truck operator to see if a license plate was on the abandoned property at the beginning of the tow, if a private tow; and\n\n(4) If there is no address of the owner on the impound report, check the law enforcement report to see if an out-of-state address is indicated on the driver license information.\n\n4.

The petition shall name the towing company among the defendants. The petition may also name the agency ordering the tow or the owner, lessee or agent of the real property from which the abandoned property was removed. The director of revenue shall not be a party to such petition but a copy of the petition shall be served on the director of revenue who shall not issue title to such abandoned property pursuant to this section until the petition is finally decided.\n\n(2) Upon filing of a petition in the associate circuit court, the owner or lienholder may have the abandoned property released upon posting with the court a cash or surety bond or other adequate security equal to the amount of the charges for towing and storage to ensure the payment of such charges in the event he does not prevail. Upon the posting of the bond and the payment of the applicable fees, the court shall issue an order notifying the towing company of the posting of the bond and directing the towing company to release the abandoned property. At the time of such release, after reasonable inspection, the owner or lienholder shall give a receipt to the towing company reciting any claims for loss or damage to the abandoned property or the contents thereof.\n\n(3) Upon determining the respective rights of the parties, the final order of the court shall provide for immediate payment in full of recovery, towing, and storage fees by the abandoned property owner or lienholder or the owner, lessee, or agent thereof of the real property from which the abandoned property was removed.\n\n6.

Any municipality or county which has physical possession of the abandoned property and which sells abandoned property in accordance with a local ordinance may transfer ownership by means of a bill of sale signed by the municipal or county clerk or deputy and sealed with the official municipal or county seal. Such bill of sale shall contain the make and model of the abandoned property, the complete abandoned property identification number and the odometer reading of the abandoned property if available and shall be lawful proof of ownership for any dealer registered under the provisions of section 301.218, or section 301.560, or for any other person. Any dealer or other person purchasing such property from a municipality or county shall apply within thirty days of purchase for a certificate. Anyone convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty of an infraction.\n\n11.

If abandoned property is insured and the insurer of property regards the property as a total loss and the insurer satisfies a claim by the owner for the property, then the insurer or lienholder shall claim and remove the property from the storage facility or make arrangements to transfer the title, and such transfer of title subject to agreement shall be in complete satisfaction of all claims for towing and storage, to the towing company or storage facility. The owner of the abandoned vehicle, lienholder or insurer, to the extent the vehicle owner's insurance policy covers towing and storage charges, shall pay reasonable fees assessed by the towing company and storage facility. The property shall be claimed and removed or title transferred to the towing company or storage facility within thirty days of the date that the insurer paid a claim for the total loss of the property or is notified as to the location of the abandoned property, whichever is the later event.

Regulations as to weight — axle load, tandem axle defined — transport of specific items, total gross weight permitted — requirements during disasters — specific vehicles, maximum weight. —1. No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be moved or operated on any highway in this state having a greater weight than twenty thousand pounds on one axle, no combination of vehicles operated by transporters of general freight over regular routes as defined in section 390.020 shall be moved or operated on any highway of this state having a greater weight than the vehicle manufacturer's rating on a steering axle with the maximum weight not to exceed twelve thousand pounds on a steering axle, and no vehicle shall be moved or operated on any state highway of this state having a greater weight than thirty-four thousand pounds on any tandem axle; the term\"tandem axle\"shall mean a group of two or more axles, arranged one behind another, the distance between the extremes of which is more than forty inches and not more than ninety-six inches apart.\n\n2. An\"axle load\"is defined as the total load transmitted to the road by all wheels whose centers are included between two parallel transverse vertical planes forty inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.\n\n3. Subject to the limit upon the weight imposed upon a highway of this state through any one axle or on any tandem axle, the total gross weight with load imposed by any group of two or more consecutive axles of any vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed the maximum load in pounds as set forth in the following table:\n\n­­Notwithstanding the above table, two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand pounds each if the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six feet or more.\n\n4. Whenever the state highways and transportation commission finds that any state highway bridge in the state is in such a condition that use of such bridge by vehicles of the weights specified in subsection 3 of this section will endanger the bridge, or the users of the bridge, the commission may establish maximum weight limits and speed limits for vehicles using such bridge. The governing body of any city or county may grant authority by act or ordinance to the commission to enact the limitations established in this section on those roadways within the purview of such city or county. Notice of the weight limits and speed limits established by the commission shall be given by posting signs at a conspicuous place at each end of any such bridge.\n\n5. Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting lawful axle loads, tandem axle loads or gross loads in excess of those permitted under the provisions of P.L. 97-424 codified in Title 23 of the United States Code (23 U.S.C. Section 101, et al.), as amended.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the weight limitations contained in this section, any vehicle or combination of vehicles operating on highways other than the interstate highway system may exceed single axle, tandem axle and gross weight limitations in an amount not to exceed two thousand pounds. However, total gross weight shall not exceed eighty thousand pounds, except as provided in subsections 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 of this section.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the commission shall issue a single-use special permit, or upon request of the owner of the truck or equipment shall issue an annual permit, for the transporting of any crane or concrete pump truck or well-drillers' equipment. The commission shall set fees for the issuance of permits and parameters for the transport of cranes pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 301.133, cranes, concrete pump trucks, or well-drillers' equipment may be operated on state-maintained roads and highways at any time on any day.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the provision of this section to the contrary, the maximum gross vehicle limit and axle weight limit for any vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with an idle reduction technology may be increased by a quantity necessary to compensate for the additional weight of the idle reduction system as provided for in 23 U.S.C. Section 127, as amended. In no case shall the additional weight increase allowed by this subsection be greater than five hundred fifty pounds. Upon request by an appropriate law enforcement officer, the vehicle operator shall provide proof that the idle reduction technology is fully functional at all times and that the gross weight increase is not used for any purpose other than for the use of idle reduction technology.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other law to the contrary, the total gross weight of any vehicle or combination of vehicles hauling milk from a farm to a processing facility or livestock may be as much as, but shall not exceed, eighty-five thousand five hundred pounds while operating on highways other than the interstate highway system. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to vehicles operated and operating on the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.\n\n10. Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other law to the contrary, any vehicle or combination of vehicles hauling grain or grain coproducts during times of harvest may be as much as, but not exceeding, ten percent over the maximum weight limitation allowable under subsection 3 of this section while operating on highways other than the interstate highway system. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to vehicles operated and operating on the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.\n\n11. Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other law to the contrary, the commission shall issue emergency utility response permits for the transporting of utility wires or cables, poles, and equipment needed for repair work immediately following a disaster where utility service has been disrupted. Under exigent circumstances, verbal approval of such operation may be made either by the department of transportation motor carrier compliance supervisor or other designated motor carrier services representative. Utility vehicles and equipment used to assist utility companies granted special permits under this subsection may be operated and transported on state-maintained roads and highways at any time on any day. The commission shall promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2014, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, emergency vehicles designed to be used under emergency conditions to transport personnel and equipment and to support the suppression of fires and mitigate hazardous situations may have a maximum gross vehicle weight of eighty-six thousand pounds inclusive of twenty-four thousand pounds on a single steering axle; thirty-three thousand five hundred pounds on a single drive axle; sixty-two thousand pounds on a tandem axle; or fifty-two thousand pounds on a tandem rear-drive steer axle; except that, such emergency vehicles shall only operate on the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.\n\n13. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a vehicle operated by an engine fueled primarily by natural gas may operate upon the public highways of this state in excess of the vehicle weight limits set forth in this section by an amount that is equal to the difference between the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by that vehicle and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system. In no event shall the maximum gross vehicle weight of the vehicle operating with a natural gas engine exceed eighty-two thousand pounds.\n\n14. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, local log trucks and local log truck tractors, as defined in section 301.010, may be operated with a weight not exceeding twenty-two thousand four hundred pounds on one axle or a weight not exceeding forty-four thousand eight hundred pounds on any tandem axle, except the front steering axle shall not exceed fifteen thousand pounds or the gross vehicle weight rating set by the manufacturer, and may have a total weight of up to one hundred nine thousand six hundred pounds. Provided however, when operating on the national system of interstate and defense highways described in 23 U.S.C. Section 103, as amended, or outside the radius from the forested site specified in section 301.010 with an extended distance local log truck permit, the vehicle shall not exceed the weight limits otherwise specified in this section.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8406, A.L. 1943 p. 663, A. 1949 S.B. 1113, A.L. 1951 p. 695, A.L. 1957 p. 624, A.L. 1963 p. 417, A.L. 1965 p. 489, A.L. 1967 p. 412, A.L. 1983 H.B. 539, A.L. 1985 H.B. 157 merged with H.B. 330, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1948, A.L. 2001 S.B. 244, A.L. 2008 S.B. 930 & 947, A.L. 2012 S.B. 470 merged with S.B. 568 merged with S.B. 631, A.L. 2013 H.B. 103, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1190, A.L. 2015 S.B. 12, A.L. 2017 S.B. 8 merged with S.B. 222 merged with S.B. 225, A.L. 2018 S.B. 683 merged with S.B. 881, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1963, A.L. 2022 1st Ex.

It shall be the duty of the sheriff of each county or city to see that the provisions of sections 304.170 to 304.230 are enforced, and any peace officer or police officer of any county or city or any highway patrol officer shall have the power to arrest on sight or upon a warrant any person found violating or having violated the provisions of such sections. Beginning January 1, 2009, only law enforcement officers that have been approved by the Missouri state highway patrol under section 304.232, members of the Missouri state highway patrol, commercial vehicle enforcement officers, and commercial vehicle inspectors appointed under subsection 4 of this section shall have the authority to conduct random roadside examinations or inspections to determine compliance with sections 304.170 to 304.230, and only such officers shall have the authority, with or without probable cause to believe that the size or weight is in excess of that permitted by sections 304.170 to 304.230, to require the driver, operator, owner, lessee, or bailee, to stop, drive, or otherwise move to a location to determine compliance with sections 304.170 to 304.230. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a law enforcement officer not certified under section 304.232 may stop a vehicle that has a visible external safety defect relating to the enforcement of the provisions of sections 304.170 to 304.230 that could cause immediate harm to the traveling public. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a law enforcement officer not certified under section 304.232 from stopping and detaining a commercial motor vehicle when such officer has probable cause to believe that the commercial motor vehicle is being used to conduct illegal or criminal activities unrelated to violations of sections 304.170 to 304.230. In the course of a stop, the law enforcement officer shall identify to the driver the defect that caused the stop. If the vehicle passes a comprehensive roadside inspection, the law enforcement officer, state highway patrolman, or other authorized person shall issue such vehicle a commercial vehicle safety alliance inspection decal to be affixed to the vehicle in a manner prescribed by the commercial vehicle safety alliance. The superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol shall promulgate rules and regulations relating to the implementation of the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2008, shall be invalid and void.\n\n2. Any peace officer approved under section 304.232 or any highway patrol officer is hereby given the power to stop any such conveyance or vehicle as above described upon the public highway for the purpose of determining whether such vehicle is loaded in excess of the provisions of sections 304.170 to 304.230, and if he or she finds such vehicle loaded in violation of the provisions thereof he or she shall have a right at that time and place to cause the excess load to be removed from such vehicle; and provided further, that any regularly employed maintenance man of the department of transportation shall have the right and authority in any part of this state to stop any such conveyance or vehicle upon the public highway for the purpose of determining whether such vehicle is loaded in excess of the provisions of sections 304.170 to 304.230, and if he or she finds such vehicle loaded in violation of the provisions thereof, he or she shall have the right at that time and place to cause the excess load to be removed from such vehicle. When only an axle or a tandem axle group of a vehicle is overloaded, the operator shall be permitted to shift the load, if this will not overload some other axle or axles, without being charged with a violation; provided, however, the privilege of shifting the weight without being charged with a violation shall not extend to or include vehicles while traveling on the federal interstate system of highways. When only an axle or tandem axle group of the vehicle traveling on the federal interstate system of highways is overloaded and a court authorized to enforce the provisions of sections 304.170 to 304.230 finds that the overloading was due to the inadvertent shifting of the load changing axle weights in transit through no fault of the operator of the vehicle and that the load thereafter had been shifted so that no axle had been overloaded, then the court may find that no violation has been committed. The operator of any vehicle shall be permitted to back up and reweigh, or to turn around and weigh from the opposite direction. Any operator whose vehicle is weighed and found to be within five percent of any legal limit may request and receive a weight ticket, memorandum or statement showing the weight or weights on each axle or any combinations of axles. Once a vehicle is found to be within the limits of section 304.180 after having been weighed on any state scale and there is no evidence that any cargo or fuel has been added, no violation shall occur, but a presumption shall exist that cargo or fuel has been added if upon reweighing on another state scale the total gross weight exceeds the applicable limits of section 304.180 or 304.190. The highways and transportation commission of this state may deputize and appoint any number of their regularly employed maintenance men to enforce the provisions of such sections, and the maintenance men delegated and appointed in this section shall report to the proper officers any violations of sections 304.170 to 304.230 for prosecution by such proper officers.\n\n3. The superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol may assign qualified persons who are not highway patrol officers to supervise or operate permanent or portable weigh stations used in the enforcement of commercial vehicle laws. These persons shall be designated as commercial vehicle inspectors and have limited police powers:\n\n(1) To issue uniform traffic tickets at a permanent or portable weigh station for violations of rules and regulations of the division of motor carrier services of the highway and transportation commission and department of public safety, and laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicles and trailers and related to size, weight, fuel tax, registration, equipment, driver requirements, transportation of hazardous materials and operators' or chauffeurs' licenses, and the provisions of sections 303.024 and 303.025;\n\n(2) To require the operator of any commercial vehicle to stop and submit to a vehicle and driver inspection to determine compliance with commercial vehicle laws, rules, and regulations, the provisions of sections 303.024 and 303.025, and to submit to a cargo inspection when reasonable grounds exist to cause belief that a vehicle is transporting hazardous materials as defined by Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations;\n\n(3) To make arrests for violation of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. Commercial vehicle inspectors shall not have the authority to exercise the powers granted in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection until they have successfully completed training approved by the superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol; nor shall they have the right as peace officers to bear arms.\n\n4. The superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol may appoint qualified persons, who are not members of the highway patrol, designated as commercial vehicle enforcement officers, with the powers:\n\n(1) To issue uniform traffic tickets for violations of laws, rules and regulations pertaining to commercial vehicles, trailers, special mobile equipment and drivers of such vehicles, and the provisions of sections 303.024 and 303.025;\n\n(2) To require the operator of any commercial vehicle to stop and submit to a vehicle and driver inspection to determine compliance with commercial vehicle laws, rules, and regulations, compliance with the provisions of sections 303.024 and 303.025, and to submit to a cargo inspection when reasonable grounds exist to cause belief that a vehicle is transporting hazardous materials as defined by Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations;\n\n(3) To make arrests upon warrants and for violations of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. Commercial vehicle officers selected and designated as peace officers by the superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol are hereby declared to be peace officers of the state of Missouri, with full power and authority to make arrests solely for violations under the powers granted in subdivisions (1) to (3) of this subsection. Commercial vehicle enforcement officers shall not have the authority to exercise the powers granted in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection until they have successfully completed training approved by the superintendent of the Missouri state highway patrol and have completed the mandatory standards for the basic training and licensure of peace officers established by the peace officers standards and training commission under subsection 1 of section 590.030. Commercial vehicle officers who are employed and performing their duties on August 28, 2008, shall have until July 1, 2012, to comply with the mandatory standards regarding police officer basic training and licensure. Commercial vehicle enforcement officers shall have the right as peace officers to bear arms.\n\n5. Any additional employees needed for the implementation of this section shall be hired in conformity with the provisions of the federal fair employment and antidiscrimination acts.\n\n6. Any part of this section which shall be construed to be in conflict with the axle or tandem axle load limits permitted by the Federal-Aid Highway Act, Section 127 of Title 23 of the United States Code (Public Law 85-767, 85th Congress) shall be null, void and of no effect.\n\n7. The superintendent may also appoint members of the patrol who are certified under the commercial vehicle safety alliance with the power to conduct commercial motor vehicle and driver inspections and to require the operator of any commercial vehicle to stop and submit to said inspections to determine compliance with commercial vehicle laws, rules, and regulations, compliance with the provisions of sections 303.024 and 303.025, and to submit to a cargo inspection when reasonable grounds exist to cause belief that a vehicle is transporting hazardous materials as defined by Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8408, A.L. 1963 p. 422, A.L. 1965 p. 492, A.L. 1979 H.B. 454, A.L. 1985 H.B. 157 merged with H.B. 368, A.L. 1994 S.B. 475, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1802, A.L. 2008 S.B. 930 & 947)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 7790\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nDivision of motor carrier and railroad safety abolished, duties and functions transferred to highways and transportation commission and department of transportation, 226.008\n\n(1994) Search of commercial motor vehicle pursuant to section was objectively authorized and legally permitted as state had legitimate governmental interest in stopping, weighing and inspecting vehicles for safety of persons traveling on state's highways and did not violate Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibiting unreasonable search and seizures.
