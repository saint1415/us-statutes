Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain, a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.\n\n2. An agreement to terminate shall be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.\n\n3. In the case of a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement shall set forth the minimum terms of the sale.\n\n4. In the case of a condominium containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but may not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all the unit owners consent to the sale.\n\n5. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of this section. If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection 8 of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate which formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by sections 448.1-101 to 448.4-120 or the declaration.\n\n6. If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the common elements and, in a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the condominium vests upon termination in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection 8 of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate which formerly constituted his unit.\n\n7. Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded prior to termination, may enforce such liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association shall be treated as if they had perfected liens on the unit immediately prior to termination.\n\n8. The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections 3, 4, and 5 of this section are as follows:\n\n(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements, and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements;\n\n(2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.\n\n9. Except as provided in subsection 10 of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium.\n\n10. If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration, and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium.\n\n(L. 1983 H.B. 177)",

An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.\n\n7. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit owner, mortgagee, or beneficiary under a deed of trust. No insurer issuing the policy may cancel or refuse to renew it until thirty days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses.\n\n8.

The association shall be entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments. A judgment or decree in any action brought pursuant to this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney's fees for the prevailing party. Attorneys' fees and costs shall not be included in the association's lien under subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n8.

The demand to the tenant shall be in writing, with a copy to the record owner, sent via first class United States mail, postage prepaid, or hand delivery. A tenant is immune from any claim by the record owner related to the rent timely paid to the association after the association has made written demand. If the tenant fails to make payment to the association, the association may issue notice and evict under chapter 534.

Whether perfected before or after the creation of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the condominium, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of such payment, shall promptly deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.\n\n4. A judgment against the association shall be indexed in the name of the condominium and the association and, if so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.\n\n(L. 1983 H.B. 177)",

A declarant of a condominium containing conversion buildings, and any person in the business of selling real estate for his own account who intends to offer units in such a condominium, shall give each of the residential tenants and any residential subtenant in possession of a portion of a conversion building notice of the conversion no later than one hundred twenty days before the declarant will require the tenants and any subtenant in possession to vacate, and the declarant shall further provide those persons with the original sale certificate not less than sixty days before the termination of such one hundred twenty-day period nor less than sixty days before the declarant will require those persons to vacate, whichever is the later date. The notice shall set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand-delivered to each unit or mailed by prepaid United States mail to the tenant and subtenant at the address of each unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required by the declarant to vacate upon less than the later of one hundred twenty days' notice or upon notice less than sixty days after receipt of the original sale certificate, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct which disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period.

The notice required by subsection 1 of this section shall be accompanied by any form requesting age, income, and any other information of residential tenants which the local government entity may provide to declarant for the purpose of gathering data on the low or moderate income tenant affected by condominium conversions.\n\n3.

Any disabled tenant of a conversion building on the date said notice of conversion was given shall have the right to occupy his unit as provided in this section for a one-year period with the option to renew for no more than two successive periods. To exercise the right to occupy, the tenant shall notify the declarant in writing within thirty days of receipt of the notice of conversion. If a tenant dies after exercising a right under this section, the surviving spouse, if qualified as a low or moderate income elderly or disabled tenant at the time of the decedent spouse's death, shall succeed to that right under the same terms and with the obligations of the decedent tenant. All rights and obligations under this subdivision shall terminate upon the tenant's abandonment of the unit or by his death or the death of his successor, if any. All rights of such tenant may be waived in a written agreement with the declarant or successor unit owner, if the notice of conversion discloses fully and completely the rights and obligations provided elderly and disabled tenant under this subsection, including the applicability only to conversion buildings of six or more units, the limitation of number of units eligible in the building to be converted, the rent for which the tenant will be obligated, and the qualification requirements for Missouri housing development commission financing.\n\n(2) Any unit of a conversion building which is used for residential purposes and which is occupied by one or more low or moderate income elderly or disabled tenants at the time the notice of conversion is submitted pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, shall be retained by the declarant or successor unit owner as a rental unit for occupancy by such tenants under subdivision (1) of this subsection 3. Rent to be charged tenants under this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to the carrying costs, replacement reserve, real property taxes, return on equity not to exceed ten percent per annum, and the portion of common expenses and insurance allocable to the unit. This subsection shall only apply to condominiums consisting of six or more units used for residential purposes at any time during the twelve months immediately preceding submission of the notice of conversion. In such condominium, no more than ten percent of the total number of units, but not less than one unit in any condominium consisting of six to ten units, with fractions rounded to the nearest whole, shall be required to be retained as rental units under this subsection.\n\n(3) Any declarant retaining such rental unit pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection 3 shall be eligible to apply for financial assistance, including but not limited to, a permanent loan, for the acquisition, plans, rehabilitation, or other expenses related to the development of such unit, from the Missouri housing development commission; provided, that the declarant shall have no obligation and such low or moderate income elderly or disabled tenant shall have no rights under this subsection 3 if financial assistance, in an amount sufficient to limit the tenant's rental obligations to thirty percent of the tenant's annual gross income, under this subdivision (3) is unavailable. For the purposes of this subsection 3, the Missouri housing development commission may allocate ten percent of its unobligated fund balances to provide financial assistance to any declarant whose application contains qualifying tenants and who otherwise meets the review criteria of the Missouri housing development commission, subject to the provisions of chapter 215. For the purposes of this subdivision (3),\"fund balances\"shall mean those funds in the operating account of the Missouri housing development commission or available for transfer to the operating fund as certified by the certified public accountants of the Missouri housing development commission. In the event of an excess of qualifying tenants over the number of units for which financial assistance is available, the Missouri housing development commission shall consider the factors of age, income, length of occupancy in the unit and disability in determining preference for receipt of the financial assistance under this subdivision (3).\n\n4. For sixty days after delivery or mailing of the original sale certificate, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit; provided, that in the case of a low or moderate income tenant who is seeking to purchase the unit through a government assistance program, such period may be extended by mutual agreement of the tenant and declarant. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during that sixty-day period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant unless declarant first notifies and offers the tenant the same terms, after which the tenant has ten days to accept or reject such offer. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.\n\n5. If a declarant, in violation of subsection 4 of this section, conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection 4 of this section to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection 4 of this section, but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection 4 of this section.\n\n6. If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit shall be vacated, and otherwise complies with the provisions of sections 441.050 and 441.060, the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate specified by those sections.\n\n7. Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms.\n\n8. The declarant shall submit written notice of conversion to the department in charge of building codes or the equivalent in any incorporated city, town, or village in which any portion of any building to be converted into a condominium is located. Such notice shall be filed at the time the declarant gives notice of conversion to tenant under this section.\n\n(L. 1983 H.B. 177)",

Express warranties made by any seller to a purchaser of a unit, if relied upon by the purchaser, are created as follows:\n\n(1) Any affirmation of fact or promise which relates to the unit, its use, or rights appurtenant thereto, area improvements to the condominium which would directly benefit the unit, or the right to use or have the benefit of facilities not located in the condominium, creates an express warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will conform to the affirmation or promise;\n\n(2) Any model or description of the physical characteristics of the condominium, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the model or description;\n\n(3) Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the condominium, including plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances; and\n\n(4) A provision that a buyer may put a unit only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful.\n\n2.
