The decision shall be a public record.\n\n2. If the claim is allowed, the treasurer shall make payment forthwith. The claim shall be paid without deduction for costs of notices or sale or for service charges, and any such claim paid shall include interest, if the owner would have been entitled interest had the property not been presumed to be abandoned. Such interest shall equal the year-to-date annualized average rate of return on all funds invested by the state treasurer for each year of accrual and the previous year's annualized average rate of return for the current fiscal year, but shall not accrue more than seven years after such property has been determined to be abandoned and transferred to the custody of the state.\n\n3. The treasurer*, after paying a claim, is discharged and released to the same extent as if the treasurer dealt with a legal representative of the owner. The treasurer is not required to see to the application of the payment or to inquire into the truth of any statement made in the claim except to the extent that confirmatory information is provided to the treasurer. Any claimant, attorney in fact, attorney, or anyone representing a claimant to whom payment is made is accountable therefor to any other person having a superior right to the payment.\n\n(L. 1984 H.B. 1088 § 19 subsecs. 1, 2, A.L. 1989 H.B. 506, A.L. 1993 H.B. 566, A.L. 1994 S.B. 757, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1510)\n\n*Word \"treasure\" appears in original rolls.",

No agreement entered into after a report is filed is valid if any person undertakes thereby to locate or reveal the whereabouts of property included in that report for a fee or compensation, unless the agreement discloses the nature and value of the property, is in writing, duly signed and acknowledged by the property owner.\n\n2. Any agreement to pay compensation to recover or assist in the recovery of property reported or delivered to the treasurer under the provisions of sections 447.500 to 447.595 which is made within twelve months after the date of payment or delivery to the treasurer is unenforceable. Any agreement to pay compensation to recover or assist in the recovery of property reported or delivered to the treasurer which is made more than twelve months, but less than twenty-four months, after the date of payment or delivery to the treasurer shall be invalid if the compensation for recovery is greater than ten percent of the property at issue.

Any claim filed by a person acting in a representative capacity for the recovery of property reported or delivered to the treasurer under sections 447.500 to 447.595, for compensation, shall be invalid unless the person is registered with the treasurer in accordance with this section. Every person who registers with the treasurer in accordance with this section shall certify compliance and good standing with the tax, business registration and other regulatory requirements of the state of Missouri. To remain registered a person must annually recertify compliance with such requirements.\n\n4.

In such a case, the treasurer shall notify the person in writing of the grounds for the proposed suspension of registration and provide the person an opportunity to respond to the allegations in writing or, upon request, through a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 536. For good cause shown, the treasurer may refrain from acting on any claim filed by such a person pending determination of the appropriateness of suspending such a person's registration. Suspension of a person's registration by the treasurer shall not be a prerequisite nor a substitute for any other civil or criminal causes of action to which such person may otherwise be subject, but is in addition to such possible remedies. Any information obtained or compiled by the treasurer in determining whether to register or suspend such a person's registration may be disclosed to appropriate law enforcement agencies, in any investigation, action or proceeding, civil, criminal or mixed, brought by a governmental agency to enforce the laws of this state, and except for the treasurer's office work product, upon court order in any action or proceeding where such information is material to an issue in the action or proceeding.\n\n6. Any person whose registration has been suspended or which has lapsed pursuant to this section may thereafter seek to reregister in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n7. Subsection 1 of this section shall not apply to any agreement made by any person, including personal representatives, guardians, trustee, and others in a representative capacity, with another to discover property in which such person has an interest for a fixed fee or hourly or daily rate, not contingent upon the discovery of property or the value of property discovered; provided, however, that any agreement entered into under this subsection for the purpose of evading the provisions of subsection 1 of this section shall be invalid and unenforceable.\n\n8. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an owner from asserting, at any time, that any agreement to locate or reveal the whereabouts of properties is based on an excessive or unjust consideration.\n\n9.

The treasurer may prohibit the registration of any person convicted for violation of this section.\n\n10. The treasurer may review any claim and contact any person or other party making a claim to ensure compliance with sections 447.500 to 447.595. The treasurer may withhold payment of any claim until the treasurer is reasonably satisfied that the claim is legitimate, that the representative acting under an agreement under this section is in compliance with the provisions of this section, and that the person making the claim is aware of the nature and potential value of the person's claim.\n\n(L. 1986 H.B. 1547, A.L. 1994 S.B. 757, A.L. 2018 S.B. 644)",

For eligible projects, the director of the department of economic development, with notice to the directors of the departments of natural resources and revenue, and subject to the other provisions of sections 447.700 to 447.718, may not create a new enterprise zone but may decide that a prospective operator of a facility being remedied and renovated pursuant to sections 447.700 to 447.718 may receive the tax credits and exemptions pursuant to sections 135.100 to 135.150 and sections 135.200 to 135.257. The tax credits allowed pursuant to this subsection shall be used to offset the tax imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or the tax otherwise imposed by chapter 147, or the tax otherwise imposed by chapter 148. For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(1) For receipt of the ad valorem tax abatement pursuant to section 135.215, the eligible project must create at least ten new jobs or retain businesses which supply at least twenty-five existing jobs. The city, or county if the eligible project is not located in a city, must provide ad valorem tax abatement of at least fifty percent for a period not less than ten years and not more than twenty-five years;\n\n(2) For receipt of the income tax exemption pursuant to section 135.220 and tax credit for new or expanded business facilities pursuant to sections 135.100 to 135.150, and 135.225, the eligible project must create at least ten new jobs or retain businesses which supply at least twenty-five existing jobs, or combination thereof. For purposes of sections 447.700 to 447.718, the tax credits described in section 135.225 are modified as follows: the tax credit shall be four hundred dollars per employee per year, an additional four hundred dollars per year for each employee exceeding the minimum employment thresholds of ten and twenty-five jobs for new and existing businesses, respectively, an additional four hundred dollars per year for each person who is a person difficult to employ as defined by section 135.240, and investment tax credits at the same amounts and levels as provided in subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 135.225;\n\n(3) For eligibility to receive the income tax refund pursuant to section 135.245, the eligible project must create at least ten new jobs or retain businesses which supply at least twenty-five existing jobs, or combination thereof, and otherwise comply with the provisions of section 135.245 for application and use of the refund and the eligibility requirements of this section;\n\n(4) The eligible project operates in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including permitting and registration requirements, of this state as well as the federal and local requirements;\n\n(5) The eligible project operator shall file such reports as may be required by the director of economic development or the director's designee;\n\n(6) The taxpayer may claim the state tax credits authorized by this subsection and the state income exemption for a period not in excess of ten consecutive tax years. For the purpose of this section,\"taxpayer\"means an individual proprietorship, partnership or corporation described in section 143.441 or 143.471 who operates an eligible project. The director shall determine the number of years the taxpayer may claim the state tax credits and the state income exemption based on the projected net state economic benefits attributed to the eligible project;\n\n(7) For the purpose of meeting the new job requirement prescribed in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, it shall be required that at least ten new jobs be created and maintained during the taxpayer's tax period for which the credits are earned, in the case of an eligible project that does not replace a similar facility in Missouri.\"New job\"means a person who was not previously employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the time the person was employed by that taxpayer to work at, or in connection with, the eligible project on a full-time basis.\"Full-time basis\"means the employee works an average of at least thirty-five hours per week during the taxpayer's tax period for which the tax credits are earned. For the purposes of this section, \"related taxpayer\" has the same meaning as defined in subdivision (10)*of section 135.100;\n\n(8) For the purpose of meeting the existing job retention requirement, if the eligible project replaces a similar facility that closed elsewhere in Missouri prior to the end of the taxpayer's tax period in which the tax credits are earned, it shall be required that at least twenty-five existing jobs be retained at, and in connection with the eligible project, on a full-time basis during the taxpayer's tax period for which the credits are earned.\"Retained job\"means a person who was previously employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer, at a facility similar to the eligible project that closed elsewhere in Missouri prior to the end of the taxpayer's tax period in which the tax credits are earned, within the tax period immediately preceding the time the person was employed by the taxpayer to work at, or in connection with, the eligible project on a full-time basis.\"Full-time basis\"means the employee works an average of at least thirty-five hours per week during the taxpayer's tax period for which the tax credits are earned;\n\n(9) In the case where an eligible project replaces a similar facility that closed elsewhere in Missouri prior to the end of the taxpayer's tax period in which the tax credits are earned, the owner and operator of the eligible project shall provide the director with a written statement explaining the reason for discontinuing operations at the closed facility. The statement shall include a comparison of the activities performed at the closed facility prior to the date the facility ceased operating, to the activities performed at the eligible project, and a detailed account describing the need and rationale for relocating to the eligible project. If the director finds the relocation to the eligible project significantly impaired the economic stability of the area in which the closed facility was located, and that such move was detrimental to the overall economic development efforts of the state, the director may deny the taxpayer's request to claim tax benefits;\n\n(10) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for the purpose of this section, the number of new jobs created and maintained, the number of existing jobs retained, and the value of new qualified investment used at the eligible project during any tax year shall be determined by dividing by twelve, in the case of jobs, the sum of the number of individuals employed at the eligible project, or in the case of new qualified investment, the value of new qualified investment used at the eligible project, on the last business day of each full calendar month of the tax year. If the eligible project is in operation for less than the entire tax year, the number of new jobs created and maintained, the number of existing jobs retained, and the value of new qualified investment created at the eligible project during any tax year shall be determined by dividing the sum of the number of individuals employed at the eligible project, or in the case of new qualified investment, the value of new qualified investment used at the eligible project, on the last business day of each full calendar month during the portion of the tax year during which the eligible project was in operation, by the number of full calendar months during such period;\n\n(11) For the purpose of this section,\"new qualified investment\"means new business facility investment as defined and as determined in subdivision (8)*of section 135.100 which is used at and in connection with the eligible project. New qualified investment shall not include small tools, supplies and inventory.\"Small tools\"means tools that are portable and can be hand held.\n\n2. The determination of the director of economic development pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall not affect requirements for the prospective purchaser to obtain the approval of the granting of real property tax abatement by the municipal or county government where the eligible project is located.\n\n3. (1) The director of the department of economic development, with the approval of the director of the department of natural resources, may, in addition to the tax credits allowed in subsection 1 of this section, grant a remediation tax credit to the applicant for up to one hundred percent of the costs of materials, supplies, equipment, labor, professional engineering, consulting and architectural fees, permitting fees and expenses, demolition, asbestos abatement, and direct utility charges for performing the voluntary remediation activities for the preexisting hazardous substance contamination and releases, including, but not limited to, the costs of performing operation and maintenance of the remediation equipment at the property beyond the year in which the systems and equipment are built and installed at the eligible project and the costs of performing the voluntary remediation activities over a period not in excess of four tax years following the taxpayer's tax year in which the system and equipment were first put into use at the eligible project, provided the remediation activities are the subject of a plan submitted to, and approved by, the director of natural resources pursuant to sections 260.565 to 260.575. The tax credit may also include up to one hundred percent of the costs of demolition that are not directly part of the remediation activities, provided that the demolition is on the property where the voluntary remediation activities are occurring, the demolition is necessary to accomplish the planned use of the facility where the remediation activities are occurring, and the demolition is part of a redevelopment plan approved by the municipal or county government and the department of economic development. The demolition may occur on an adjacent property if the project is located in a municipality which has a population less than twenty thousand and the above conditions are otherwise met. The adjacent property shall independently qualify as abandoned or underutilized. The amount of the credit available for demolition not associated with remediation cannot exceed the total amount of credits approved for remediation including demolition required for remediation.\n\n(2) The amount of remediation tax credits issued shall be limited to the least amount necessary to cause the project to occur, as determined by the director of the department of economic development.\n\n(3) The director may, with the approval of the director of natural resources, extend the tax credits allowed for performing voluntary remediation maintenance activities, in increments of three-year periods, not to exceed five consecutive three-year periods. The tax credits allowed in this subsection shall be used to offset the tax imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or the tax otherwise imposed by chapter 147, or the tax otherwise imposed by chapter 148. The remediation tax credit may be taken in the same tax year in which the tax credits are received or may be taken over a period not to exceed twenty years.\n\n(4) The project facility shall be projected to create at least ten new jobs or at least twenty-five retained jobs, or a combination thereof, as determined by the department of economic development, to be eligible for tax credits pursuant to this section.\n\n(5) No more than seventy-five percent of earned remediation tax credits may be issued when the remediation costs were paid, and the remaining percentage may be issued when the department of natural resources issues a letter of completion letter or covenant not to sue following completion of the voluntary remediation activities. It shall not include any costs associated with ongoing operational environmental compliance of the facility or remediation costs arising out of spills, leaks, or other releases arising out of the ongoing business operations of the facility. In the event the department of natural resources issues a letter of completion for a portion of a property, an impacted media such as soil or groundwater, or for a site or a portion of a site improvement, a prorated amount of the remaining percentage may be released based on the percentage of the total site receiving a letter of completion.\n\n4. In the exercise of the sound discretion of the director of the department of economic development or the director's designee, the tax credits and exemptions described in this section may be terminated, suspended or revoked if the eligible project fails to continue to meet the conditions set forth in this section. In making such a determination, the director shall consider the severity of the condition violation, actions taken to correct the violation, the frequency of any condition violations and whether the actions exhibit a pattern of conduct by the eligible facility owner and operator. The director shall also consider changes in general economic conditions and the recommendation of the director of the department of natural resources, or his or her designee, concerning the severity, scope, nature, frequency and extent of any violations of the environmental compliance conditions. The taxpayer or person claiming the tax credits or exemptions may appeal the decision regarding termination, suspension or revocation of any tax credit or exemption in accordance with the procedures outlined in subsections 4 and 5 of section 135.250. The director of the department of economic development shall notify the directors of the departments of natural resources and revenue of the termination, suspension or revocation of any tax credits as determined in this section or pursuant to the provisions of section 447.716.\n\n5. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no taxpayer shall earn the tax credits, exemptions or refund otherwise allowed in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of subsection 1 of this section and the tax credits otherwise allowed in section 135.110, or the tax credits, exemptions and refund otherwise allowed in sections 135.215, 135.220, 135.225 and 135.245, respectively, for the same facility for the same tax period.\n\n6. The total amount of the tax credits allowed in subsection 1 of this section may not exceed the greater of:\n\n(1) That portion of the taxpayer's income attributed to the eligible project; or\n\n(2) One hundred percent of the total business' income tax if the eligible facility does not replace a similar facility that closed elsewhere in Missouri prior to the end of the taxpayer's tax period in which the tax credits are earned, and further provided the taxpayer does not operate any other facilities besides the eligible project in Missouri; fifty percent of the total business' income tax if the eligible facility replaces a similar facility that closed elsewhere in Missouri prior to the end of the taxpayer's tax period in which the credits are earned, and further provided the taxpayer does not operate any other facilities besides the eligible project in Missouri; or twenty-five percent of the total business income if the taxpayer operates, in addition to the eligible facility, any other facilities in Missouri. In no case shall a taxpayer operating more than one eligible project in Missouri be allowed to offset more than twenty-five percent of the taxpayer's business income in any tax period. That portion of the taxpayer's income attributed to the eligible project as referenced in subdivision (1) of this subsection, for which the credits allowed in sections 135.110 and 135.225 and subsection 3 of this section may apply, shall be determined in the same manner as prescribed in subdivision (5)*of section 135.100. That portion of the taxpayer's franchise tax attributed to the eligible project for which the remediation tax credit may offset, shall be determined in the same manner as prescribed in paragraph (a) of subdivision (5)*of section 135.100.\n\n7. Taxpayers claiming the state tax benefits allowed in subdivisions (2) and (3) of subsection 1 of this section shall be required to file all applicable tax credit applications, forms and schedules prescribed by the director during the taxpayer's tax period immediately after the tax period in which the eligible project was first put into use. Otherwise, the taxpayer's right to claim such state tax benefits shall be forfeited. Unused business facility and enterprise zone tax credits shall not be carried forward but shall be initially claimed for the tax period during which the eligible project was first capable of being used, and during any applicable subsequent tax periods.\n\n8. Taxpayers claiming the remediation tax credit allowed in subsection 3 of this section shall be required to file all applicable tax credit applications, forms and schedules prescribed by the director during the taxpayer's tax period immediately after the tax period in which the eligible project was first put into use, or during the taxpayer's tax period immediately after the tax period in which the voluntary remediation activities were performed.\n\n9. The recipient of remediation tax credits, for the purpose of this subsection referred to as assignor, may assign, sell or transfer, in whole or in part, the remediation tax credit allowed in subsection 3 of this section to any other person, for the purpose of this subsection referred to as assignee. To perfect the transfer, the assignor shall provide written notice to the director of the assignor's intent to transfer the tax credits to the assignee, the date the transfer is effective, the assignee's name, address and the assignee's tax period and the amount of tax credits to be transferred. The number of tax periods during which the assignee may subsequently claim the tax credits shall not exceed twenty tax periods, less the number of tax periods the assignor previously claimed the credits before the transfer occurred.\n\n10. In the case where an operator and assignor of an eligible project has been certified to claim state tax benefits allowed in subdivisions (2) and (3) of subsection 1 of this section, and sells or otherwise transfers title of the eligible project to another taxpayer or assignee who continues the same or substantially similar operations at the eligible project, the director shall allow the assignee to claim the credits for a period of time to be determined by the director; except that, the total number of tax periods the tax credits may be earned by the assignor and the assignee shall not exceed ten. To perfect the transfer, the assignor shall provide written notice to the director of the assignor's intent to transfer the tax credits to the assignee, the date the transfer is effective, the assignee's name, address, and the assignee's tax period, and the amount of tax credits to be transferred.\n\n11. For the purpose of the state tax benefits described in this section, in the case of a corporation described in section 143.471 or partnership, in computing Missouri's tax liability, such state benefits shall be allowed to the following:\n\n(1) The shareholders of the corporation described in section 143.471;\n\n(2) The partners of the partnership.\n\n­­The credit provided in this subsection shall be apportioned to the entities described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the taxpayer's tax period.\n\n12. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in any county of the first classification that has a charter form of government and that has a population of over nine hundred thousand inhabitants, all demolition costs incurred during the redevelopment of any former automobile manufacturing plant shall be allowable costs eligible for tax credits under sections 447.700 to 447.718 so long as the redevelopment of such former automobile manufacturing plant shall be projected to create at least two hundred fifty new jobs or at least three hundred retained jobs, or a combination thereof, as determined by the department of economic development. The amount of allowable costs eligible for tax credits shall be limited to the least amount necessary to cause the project to occur, as determined by the director of the department of economic development, provided that no tax credit shall be issued under this subsection until July 1, 2017. For purposes of this subsection,\"former automobile manufacturing plant\"means a redevelopment area that qualifies as an eligible project under section 447.700, that consists of at least one hundred acres, and that was used primarily for the manufacture of automobiles but, after 2007, ceased such manufacturing.\n\n(L. 1995 H.B. 414, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1237, A.L. 1998 S.B. 827, A.L. 2001 H.B. 133, A.L. 2008 H.B. 2058 merged with S.B. 718, A.L. 2009 H.B. 191, A.L. 2016 S.B. 861)\n\n*Statutory references changed in accordance with section 3.060 based on the renumbering of subdivisions in section 135.100 by H.B. 315, 2011.\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nTax Credit Accountability Act of 2004, additional requirements, 135.800 to 135.830",

No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of sections 447.700 to 447.718 shall become effective until it has been approved by the joint committee on administrative rules in accordance with the procedures provided in this section, and the delegation of the legislative authority to enact law by the adoption of such rules is dependent upon the power of the joint committee on administrative rules to review and suspend rules pending ratification by the senate and the house of representatives as provided in this section.\n\n3. Upon filing any proposed rule with the secretary of state, the department shall concurrently submit such proposed rule to the committee, which may hold hearings upon any proposed rule or portion thereof at any time.\n\n4. A final order of rulemaking shall not be filed with the secretary of state until thirty days after such final order of rulemaking has been received by the committee. The committee may hold one or more hearings upon such final order of rulemaking during the thirty-day period. If the committee does not disapprove such order of rulemaking within the thirty-day period, the department may file such order of rulemaking with the secretary of state and the order of rulemaking shall be deemed approved.\n\n5. The committee may, by majority vote of the members, suspend the order of rulemaking or portion thereof by action taken prior to the filing of the final order of rulemaking only for one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(1) An absence of statutory authority for the proposed rule;\n\n(2) An emergency relating to public health, safety or welfare;\n\n(3) The proposed rule is in conflict with state law;\n\n(4) A substantial change in circumstance since enactment of the law upon which the proposed rule is based.\n\n6. If the committee disapproves any rule or portion thereof, the department shall not file such disapproved portion of any rule with the secretary of state and the secretary of state shall not publish in the Missouri Register any final order of rulemaking containing the disapproved portion.\n\n7. If the committee disapproves any rule or portion thereof, the committee shall report its findings to the senate and the house of representatives. No rule or portion thereof disapproved by the committee shall take effect so long as the senate and the house of representatives ratify the act of the joint committee by resolution adopted in each house within thirty legislative days after such rule or portion thereof has been disapproved by the joint committee.\n\n8. Upon adoption of a rule as provided in this section, any such rule or portion thereof may be suspended or revoked by the general assembly either by bill or, pursuant to Section 8, Article IV of the Constitution of Missouri, by concurrent resolution upon recommendation of the joint committee on administrative rules. The committee shall be authorized to hold hearings and make recommendations pursuant to the provisions of section 536.037. The secretary of state shall publish in the Missouri Register, as soon as practicable, notice of the suspension or revocation.\n\n(L. 1995 H.B. 414)",
