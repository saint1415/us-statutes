In the event of such certification, the tenant may cause the work to be done as described herein if the landlord fails to correct the condition within fourteen days after the date of said certification or the date of the notice from the tenant, whichever is later, or as promptly as required in case of an emergency.

The plaintiff, or any interested party who submits a written request to the court to be notified of an application for a stay of execution, shall be provided reasonable notice of, and an opportunity to be heard at, all hearings relating to a stay of execution sought pursuant to this section.\n\n3. If the court stays execution of a removal or eviction order pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, then the court shall place the movant on probationary tenancy. The period of probationary tenancy shall last either six months or for the duration of the lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant, whichever is shorter. The court may impose or modify such terms and conditions of probationary tenancy as are necessary to further the purposes of sections 441.710 to 441.880 or to protect the safety, health or well-being of the surrounding community or the parties. If a defendant is determined by the court to be a drug user and drug dependent, the terms and conditions of probationary tenancy may include, but are not limited to, the periodic drug testing of the defendant, a program of reasonable community service and prompt entry into and participation in a court-approved drug treatment program.\n\n4. Following a motion by the plaintiff alleging defendant's noncompliance with the terms and conditions of probationary tenancy, and a five-day written notice served on the defendant specifying the time and place of the hearing and the particulars of the alleged noncompliance, the court may conduct a hearing on the motion. If the defendant is found by the court to have materially failed to comply with any terms or conditions of probationary tenancy, then the court shall immediately rescind the stay of execution. Any hearing held pursuant to this section shall be expedited and shall be held within five days of the court certification of service of the written notice on the defendant.\n\n5. Nothing in sections 441.710 to 441.880 shall impair the right of a party to seek the eviction or removal of a tenant or person for conduct occurring subsequent to the events giving rise to the initial cause of action, and sections 441.710 to 441.880 shall not impair the right of a landlord to refuse to extend or renew a lease or tenancy pursuant to existing law.\n\n6. Following a motion by the defendant alleging that the defendant has substantially complied with the terms and conditions of probation and that the defendant no longer poses a risk to the safety, health or well-being of the surrounding community or parties, and a five-day written notice served on the plaintiff specifying the time and place of the hearing and the particulars of the motion, the court may conduct a hearing on the motion. Upon finding sufficient evidence to support the motion, the court shall discharge the order of eviction or removal and shall dismiss the cause of action. The order of eviction or removal shall automatically be deemed discharged and the cause of action automatically deemed dismissed upon expiration of the term of probationary tenancy.\n\n(L. 1997 H.B. 361)",

      "text": "Title XXIX OWNERSHIP AND CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY\n\nChapter 441\n\n441.920. Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking — no discrimination against applicants, tenants, or lessees for residential properties. —1. For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Domestic violence\", as such term is defined in section 455.010;\n\n(2)\"Sexual assault\", as such term is defined in section 455.010;\n\n(3)\"Stalking\", as such term is defined in section 455.010.\n\n2. No applicant, tenant, or lessee shall be denied tenancy, be evicted from the premises, or found to be in violation of a lease agreement on the basis of or as a direct result of the fact that the applicant, tenant, or lessee is, has been, or is in imminent danger of becoming a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking if the applicant, tenant, or lessee otherwise qualifies for tenancy or occupancy in the premises. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply if:\n\n(1) The applicant, tenant, or lessee allowed the person named in any documentation listed in subsection 4 of this section into the premises; or\n\n(2) The landlord or property owner reasonably believes that a person named in any documentation listed in subsection 4 of this section poses a threat to the safety of the other occupants or the property.\n\n3. In any action brought by a landlord against a tenant under this chapter, chapter 534, or chapter 535, a tenant shall have an affirmative defense and not be liable for rent for the period after which the tenant vacates the premises owned by the landlord if, by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that the tenant was a victim or was in imminent danger of becoming a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking and the tenant notified the landlord and has provided any requested documentation under subsection 4 of this section.\n\n4. An applicant, tenant, or lessee shall qualify for the protections under this section if he or she provides a statement of such domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to his or her landlord or the property owner. If the landlord or property owner requests, the applicant, tenant, or lessee shall provide documentation of the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, which may be in any of the following forms:\n\n(1) A document signed by an employee of a victim service provider, or a health care professional or mental health professional from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or the effects of abuse stating that, under penalty of perjury, the individual believes in the occurrence of the incident of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for protection, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Such document shall be signed by the victim; or\n\n(2) A record of a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, including a police report, a court, or an administrative agency pertaining to the alleged incident of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n5. The submission of false information by an applicant, tenant, or lessee under this section may be a basis for a denial of tenancy, eviction, or a violation of a lease agreement.\n\n6. Any landlord or property owner may impose a reasonable termination fee on a tenant or lessee who desires to terminate a lease before the expiration date of such lease under the provisions of this section.\n\n7. The provisions of this section shall only apply to residential properties.\n\n(L. 2019 H.B. 243 & 544)",
