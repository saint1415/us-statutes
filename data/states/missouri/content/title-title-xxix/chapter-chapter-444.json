If the violation is not eliminated, the director shall provide to the operator by registered mail a notice describing the nature of the violation, corrective measures to be taken to abate the violation and the time period for abatement. Within fifteen days of receipt of this notice the operator may request an informal conference to contest the notice. The director may modify, vacate or enforce the notice and shall provide notice to the operator of his action within thirty days of the informal conference.

Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the director or any authorized representative determines that the condition, practice or violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by the director. Where the director, or any authorized representative, finds that the ordered cessation of mining and metallic minerals waste disposal activity, or any portion of such activity, will not completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the director or authorized agent shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator requiring him to take whatever steps deemed necessary to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 321 § 11, A.L. 1991 S.B. 45, A.L. 1993 S.B. 80, et al.)",

Administrative penalties, assessment, restriction — conference, conciliation and persuasion — rules — payment — appeal — collection, disposition. —1. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, upon a determination by the director that a provision of sections 444.350 to 444.380 or a standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, or a term or condition of any permit has been violated, the director may issue an order assessing an administrative penalty upon the violator under this section. An administrative penalty shall not be imposed until the director has sought to resolve the violations through conference, conciliation and persuasion and shall not be imposed for minor violations of sections 444.350 to 444.380 or minor violations of any standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to sections 444.350 to 444.380 or minor violations of any term or condition of a permit issued pursuant to sections 444.350 to 444.380. If the violation is resolved through conference, conciliation and persuasion, no administrative penalty shall be assessed unless the violation has caused, or has the potential to cause, a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. Any order assessing an administrative penalty shall state that an administrative penalty is being assessed under this section and that the person subject to the penalty may appeal as provided by this section. Any such order that fails to state the statute under which the penalty is being sought, the manner of collection or rights of appeal shall result in the state's waiving any right to collection of the penalty.\n\n2. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations for the assessment of administrative penalties. The amount of the administrative penalty assessed per day of violation for each violation under this section shall not exceed the amount of the civil penalty specified in section 444.375. Such rules shall reflect the criteria used for the administrative penalty matrix as provided for in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6928(a), Section 3008(a), and the harm or potential harm which the violation causes, or may cause the violator's previous compliance record, and any other factors which the department may reasonably deem relevant. An administrative penalty shall be paid within sixty days from the date of issuance of the order assessing the penalty. Any person subject to an administrative penalty may appeal any final order assessing an administrative penalty as provided in sections 536.100 to 536.140. Any appeal will stay the due date of such administrative penalty until the appeal is resolved. Any person who fails to pay an administrative penalty by the final due date shall be liable to the state for a surcharge of fifteen percent of the penalty plus ten percent per annum on any amounts owed. Any administrative penalty paid pursuant to this section shall be handled in accordance with Section 7 of Article IX of the State Constitution. An action may be brought in the appropriate circuit court to collect any unpaid administrative penalty, and for attorney's fees and costs incurred directly in the collection thereof.\n\n3. An administrative penalty shall not be increased in those instances where department action, or failure to act, has caused a continuation of the violation that was a basis for the penalty. Any administrative penalty must be assessed within two years following the department's initial discovery of such alleged violation, or from the date the department in the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered such alleged violation.\n\n4. The state may elect to assess an administrative penalty, or, in lieu thereof, to request that the attorney general or prosecutor file an appropriate legal action seeking a civil penalty in the appropriate circuit court.\n\n5. Any final order imposing an administrative penalty is subject to judicial review upon the filing of a petition pursuant to section 536.100 by any person subject to the administrative penalty.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 45, A.L. 1993 S.B. 80, et al.)",

Mining compact — purpose, definitions — commission, budget, powers and programs — construction. —The \"Interstate Mining Compact\"*is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nTHE INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT\n\nARTICLE I. Policies and Purposes\n\nThere is created the \"Interstate Mining Compact\".\n\na. The party States find that:\n\n1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every State are of basic significance.\n\n2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public.\n\n3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.\n\n4. Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources, but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from State to State for all mining operation similarly situated.\n\n5. The States are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.\n\nb. The purposes of this compact are to:\n\n1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining.\n\n2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining.\n\n3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party States which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.\n\n4. Assist the party States in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources.\n\n5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.\n\nARTICLE II. Definitions\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\na.\"Mining\"means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on site farming or construction.\n\nb.\"State\"means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Territory or Possession of the United States.\n\nARTICLE III. The Commission\n\na. There is created the \"Interstate Mining Commission\". The Commission consists of one voting member from each State. The Governor of each party state shall notify the Commission in writing of the member and any alternates. An alternate, may act on behalf of the member only in the member's absence. The method for selection and the expenses of each Commission member shall be the responsibility of the member's respective State.\n\nb. Each commission member is entitled to one vote. No action of the Commission is binding unless a majority of the total membership cast their votes in the affirmative.\n\nc. The commission shall elect annually from among its members a chairperson. The commission shall adopt and publish, in convenient form, bylaws, and policies which are not inconsistent with this compact, including procedures in regard to notice, conduct and recording of meetings; access by the public to records; provision of information to the public, conduct of adjudicatory hearings; and issuance of decisions.\n\nd. The commission shall meet at least once annually and shall also meet upon the call of the chairperson or a commission member.\n\ne. All meetings of the commission shall be open to the public with reasonable advance notice. The commission may, by majority vote, close a meeting to the public for the purpose of considering sensitive personnel or legal strategy matters, however, all commission actions and decisions shall be made in open meetings and appropriately recorded.\n\nf. The commission may establish advisory committees for the purpose of advising the commission on any matters pertaining to mining.\n\ng. The office of the commission shall be in a party state. The commission may appoint or contract for and compensate such limited staff necessary to carry out its duties and functions. The staff shall serve at the commission's pleasure with the exception that staff hired as the result of securing federal funds shall be hired and governed under applicable federal statutes and regulations. In selecting any staff, the commission shall assure that the staff has adequate experience and formal training to carry out the functions assigned to it by the commission.\n\nh. The commission shall:\n\n1. Receive and act on the petition of a non-party state to become an eligible state.\n\n2. Submit an annual report to, and otherwise communicate with, the governors and the appropriate officers of the legislative bodies of the commission.\n\n3. Hear, negotiate, and, as necessary, resolve by final decision disputes which may arise between the party states regarding this compact.\n\nARTICLE IV. Budget\n\n1. The Commission shall submit to each party State a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party State for presentation to the legislature thereof.\n\n2. Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party States. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party States as follows: one-half in equal shares, and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the Commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party States. Each of the Commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.\n\n3. The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.\n\n4. The Commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions and may utilize and dispose of any donations, grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services from any state or the United States (or any subdivision or agency thereof), or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation. The nature, amount and condition, if any, attendant upon any donation or grant accepted or received by the commission together with the identity of the donor, grantor or lender, shall be detailed in the annual report of the commission.\n\n5. The Commission is a legal entity separate and distinct from the party states and is liable for its actions as a separate and distinct legal entity. Liabilities of the commission are not liabilities of the party state. Members of the commission are not personally liable for actions taken by them in their official capacity.\n\na. Except as provided under paragraph four, nothing in this compact alters liability for any act, omission, course of conduct or liability resulting from any casual or other relationships.\n\nb. Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the commission may obtain judicial review of such decision in any court of jurisdiction by filing in such court a petition for review within sixty days after the commission's final decision.\n\nARTICLE V. Powers\n\na. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Interstate Mining Commission, such Commission shall have power to:\n\n1. Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operation, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change.\n\n2. Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining.\n\n3. Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact.\n\n4. Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact.\n\n5. Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interest in any subject coming within the purview of this compact.\n\n6. Consult, upon the request of a party State and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such State in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact.\n\n7. Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, techniques, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations.\n\n8. Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.\n\nARTICLE VI. State Programs\n\na. Each party State agrees that within a reasonable time, it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:\n\n1. The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations.\n\n2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water.\n\n3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.\n\n4. The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past and future.\n\nARTICLE VII. Entry Into Force and Withdrawal\n\na. This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any four or more States. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other State upon its enactment thereof.\n\nb. Any party State may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the withdrawing party State has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to all other party States. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party State prior to the time of such withdrawal.\n\nARTICLE VIII. Effect On Other Laws\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed to limit, repeal or supersede any other law of any party State.\n\nARTICLE IX. Severability and Construction\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 108)\n\n*This \"Interstate Mining Compact\" was created in April of 1971.

and provided, further, that in strip mining where the volume of overburden is large relative to the thickness of the coal deposit and where the operator demonstrates that due to volumetric expansion the amount of overburden and other spoil and waste materials removed in the course of the mining operation is more than sufficient to restore the approximate original contour, the operator shall after restoring the approximate contour, backfill, grade and compact, where advisable, the excess overburden and other spoil and waste materials to attain the lowest grade but not more than the angle of repose, and to cover all acid-forming and other toxic materials, in order to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with the surrounding region, and that such overburden and spoil shall be shaped and graded in such a way as to prevent slides, erosion, and water pollution and is revegetated in accordance with the requirements of sections 444.500 to 444.755;\n\n(4) Remove the topsoil from the land in a separate layer, replace it on the backfill area, or if not utilized immediately, segregate it in a separate pile from other spoil and when the topsoil is not replaced on a backfill area within a time short enough to avoid deterioration of the topsoil, maintain a successful cover by quick growing plants or other means thereafter so that the topsoil is preserved from wind and water erosion, remains free of any contamination by any other acid or toxic material, and is in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation when restored during reclamation, except if topsoil is of insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining vegetation, or if other strata can be shown to be more suitable for vegetation requirements, then the operator shall remove, segregate and preserve in a like manner such other strata which are best able to support vegetation;\n\n(5) Minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic balance at the mine site and in associated off-site areas and to the quality and quantity of water in surface and ground water systems both during and after strip mining operations and during reclamation by:\n\n(a) Avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such measures as, but not limited to:\n\na. Preventing or removing water from contact with toxin producing deposits;\n\nb. Treating drainage to reduce toxic content which adversely affects downstream water upon being released to watercourses; casing, sealing or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, and wells and keep acid or other toxic drainage from entering ground and surface waters;\n\n(b) Conducting strip mining operations so as to prevent, to the extent possible using the best technology available, additional contributions of suspended solids to stream flow, or runoff outside the permit area, but in no event shall contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable state or federal laws;\n\n(c) Constructing any siltation structures pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision prior to commencement of strip mining operations, such structures to be certified by a registered professional engineer to be constructed as designed and approved in the reclamation plan;\n\n(d) Cleaning out and removing temporary or large settling ponds or other siltation structures from drainways after disturbed areas are revegetated and stabilized, and depositing the silt and debris at a site and in a manner approved by the commission;\n\n(e) Restoring recharge capacity of the mined area to approximate premining conditions;\n\n(f) Avoiding channel deepening or enlargement in operations requiring the discharge of water from mines;\n\n(g) Such other actions as the commission may prescribe;\n\n(6) Design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, enlarge, modify and remove or abandon, in accordance with the standards and criteria developed by the United States Secretary of the Interior pursuant to section 515(f) of Public Law 95-87, all existing and new coal mine waste piles consisting of mined wastes, tailings, coal processing wastes, or other liquid and solid wastes, and used either temporarily or permanently as dams or embankments;\n\n(7) Ensure that explosives are used only in accordance with existing state and federal law and the regulations promulgated by the commission, which shall include provisions to:\n\n(a) Require adequate advance written notice by the operator to local governments and residents who might be affected by the use of such explosives by publication of the planned blasting schedule in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality and by mailing a copy of the proposed blasting schedule to every resident living within one-half mile of the proposed blasting site and by providing daily notice to residents or occupiers in such area prior to any blasting;\n\n(b) Require the operator to maintain for a period of at least three years and make available for public inspection upon request a log detailing the location of the blast, the pattern and depth of the drill holes, the amount of explosives used per hole, and the order and length of delay in the blast;\n\n(c) Limit the kind of explosives and detonating equipment, the size, the timing and frequency of blasts based upon the physical conditions at the site so as to prevent injury to persons, damage to public and private property outside the permit area, adverse impacts on any underground mine, and change in the course, channel or availability of ground or surface water outside the permit area;\n\n(d) Require that all blasting operations be conducted by trained and competent persons as certified by the commission;\n\n(e) Provide that upon the request of a resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted area the operator shall conduct a preblasting survey of such structures and submit the survey to the commission and a copy to the resident or owner making the request. The area of the survey shall be decided by the commission and shall include such provisions as the United States Secretary of Interior shall promulgate;\n\n(8) Establish on the regraded areas and all other lands affected, a diverse, effective and permanent vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the area of land to be affected and capable of self-regeneration and plant succession at least equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the area; except that introduced species may be used in the revegetation process where desirable and necessary to achieve the approved postmining land use plan; provided, however, that when the commission issues a written finding approving a long-term, intensive, agricultural postmining land use as part of the mining and reclamation plan, the commission may grant an exception to the requirement of permanent vegetative cover.\n\n2. With respect to steep-slope strip mining, commission regulations shall provide, in addition to those general reclamation standards required by subsection 1 of this section, the following:\n\n(1) Ensure that no debris, abandoned or disabled equipment, spoil material, or waste mineral matter be placed on the downslope below the bench or mining cut; provided, that spoil material in excess of that required for the reconstruction of the approximate original contour under the provisions of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section or subdivision (2) of this subsection below shall be permanently stored in accordance with the following standards:\n\n(a) Spoil is transported and placed in a controlled manner in position for concurrent compaction and in such a way to assure mass stability and to prevent mass movement;\n\n(b) The areas of disposal are within the bonded permit area and all organic matter shall be removed immediately prior to spoil placement;\n\n(c) Appropriate surface and internal drainage systems and diversion ditches are used so as to prevent spoil erosion and movement;\n\n(d) The disposal area does not contain springs, natural watercourses or wet weather seeps unless lateral drains are constructed from the wet areas to the main underdrains in such a manner that filtration of the water into the spoil pile will be prevented;\n\n(e) If placed on a slope, the spoil is placed upon the most moderate slope among those upon which, in the judgment of the commission, the spoil could be placed in compliance with all the requirements of sections 444.500 to 444.755, and shall be placed, where possible, upon or above a natural terrace, bench, or berm, if such placement provides additional stability and prevents mass movement;\n\n(f) Where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, a rock toe buttress, of sufficient size to prevent mass movement, is constructed;\n\n(g) The final configuration is compatible with the natural drainage patterns and surroundings and suitable for intended uses;\n\n(h) Design of the spoil disposal area is certified by a registered professional engineer in conformance with professional standards; and\n\n(i) All other provisions of sections 444.500 to 444.755 are met;\n\n(2) Complete backfilling with spoil materials shall be required to cover completely the highwall and return the site to the approximate original contour, which material will maintain stability following mining and reclamation;\n\n(3) The operator may not disturb land above the top of the highwall unless the commission finds that such disturbance will facilitate compliance with the reclamation standards of this section; provided, however, that the land disturbed above the highwall shall be limited to the amount necessary to facilitate the compliance;\n\n(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term\"steep slope\"is any slope greater than twenty degrees or such lesser slope as may be defined by the commission after consideration of soil, climate, and other characteristics of the state or a region of the state;\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to those situations in which an operator is mining on flat or gently rolling terrain, on which an occasional steep slope is encountered through which the mining operation is to proceed, leaving a plain or predominantly flat area.\n\n3. The commission may grant a variance from the requirement to restore to approximate original contour set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section where the owner of the surface knowingly requests in writing, as part of the permit application, that such a variance be granted so as to render the land, after reclamation, suitable for an industrial, commercial, residential, or public use, including recreational facilities, upon the following conditions:\n\n(1) After consultation with the appropriate land use planning agencies, if any, the potential use of the affected land is deemed to constitute an equal or better economic or public use;\n\n(2) The reclamation plan, included with the variance application, is designed and certified by a registered professional engineer in conformance with professional standards that the plan will assure the stability, drainage, and configuration necessary for the intended use of the site;\n\n(3) After approval by the director of staff of the clean water commission of the department of natural resources, the watershed of the affected land is deemed to be improved;\n\n(4) Only such amount of spoil is placed off the mine bench as is necessary to achieve the planned postmining land use, ensure stability of the spoil retained on the bench, meet all other requirements of sections 444.500 to 444.755, and all spoil placement off the mine bench must comply with paragraphs (a) through (i) of subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of this section;\n\n(5) Watershed control of the area is improved, and complete backfilling with spoil materials shall be required to cover completely the highwall, which material will maintain stability following mining and reclamation.\n\n4. The person seeking a variance under the provisions of subsection 3 of this section shall do so by filing a petition for variance with the director. The director shall investigate the petition and make a recommendation to the commission as to the disposition thereof. Upon receiving the recommendation of the director, if the recommendation is against the granting of a variance, a hearing shall be held, if requested by the petitioner within thirty days of the director's recommendation, as provided in section 444.690. If the recommendation of the director is for the granting of a variance, the commission may do so without hearing, except that upon the petition of any person who is or would be aggrieved by the granting of a variance, before or within thirty days after the commission's action, a hearing shall be held as provided in section 444.690. In any hearing under this section the burden of proof shall be on the person petitioning for a variance.\n\n5. Any variance granted pursuant to subsection 3 of this section shall run concurrently with the permit year. A variance may be extended from year to year by affirmative action of the commission; provided, however, that no variance may be extended unless the operator affirmatively demonstrates that the proposed development is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the reclamation plan.\n\n6. The variance shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as the commission deems appropriate to ensure compliance with the provisions of sections 444.500 to 444.755. Upon failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any variance as specified by the commission, the variance may be revoked or modified by the commission after a hearing held upon not less than thirty days' written notice to the operator, the owner of the surface, and any other person who has filed with the director a written request for such notification. The hearing shall be held in accordance with section 444.690.\n\n7. Nothing contained in this section shall apply to:\n\n(1) The extraction of coal by a landowner for his own noncommercial use from land owned or leased by him;\n\n(2) The extraction of coal as an incidental and noncommercial part of federal, state, or local government-financed highway or other construction;\n\n(3) The extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal does not exceed sixteen and two-thirds percent of the mineral tonnage removed for commercial use or sale; and\n\n(4) Any strip mining operation where the operator removes no more than two hundred fifty tons of coal from any one location within twelve consecutive months.\n\n(L. 1978 H.B. 934, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1836)",

      "text": "Title XXIX OWNERSHIP AND CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY\n\nChapter 444\n\n444.600. Permit — investigation, decision, hearing, court review — appeals. —1. All applications for a permit shall be filed with the director who shall promptly investigate the application and make a decision within thirty days after the application is received as to whether the permit should be issued or denied. If the director is not satisfied with the information supplied by the applicant, he or she shall recommend denial of the permit. The director shall promptly notify the applicant of this action and at the same time publish a notice of the decision in any newspaper with general circulation in the counties where the land is located, and shall send notice to those persons registered with the director pursuant to section 444.720. The director's decision shall be deemed to be the decision of the director of the department of natural resources and shall be subject to appeal to the administrative hearing commission as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013.\n\n2. Whenever a strip mine operator permit provided under section 444.540 is issued, denied, suspended, or revoked by the department of natural resources, any aggrieved person, by petition filed with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the decision, may appeal such decision as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013. For purposes of an appeal, the administrative hearing commission may consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether an interested party's health, safety, or livelihood will be unduly impaired by the issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation of the permit. The administrative hearing commission may also consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether the operator has demonstrated, during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the permit application, a pattern of noncompliance at other locations in Missouri that suggests a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In determining whether a reasonable likelihood of noncompliance will exist in the future, the administrative hearing commission may look to past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, but only to the extent they suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. Such past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, in and of themselves, are an insufficient basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In addition, such past acts shall not be used as a basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance unless the noncompliance has caused or has the potential to cause a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. If a hearing petitioner demonstrates or the administrative hearing commission finds either present acts of noncompliance or a reasonable likelihood that the permit seeker or the operations of associated persons or corporations in Missouri will be in noncompliance in the future, such a showing will satisfy the noncompliance requirement in this subsection. In addition, such basis must be developed by multiple noncompliances of any environmental law administered by the Missouri department of natural resources at any single facility in Missouri that resulted in harm to the environment or impaired the health, safety, or livelihood of persons outside the facility. For any permit seeker that has not been in business in Missouri for the past five years, the administrative hearing commission may review the record of noncompliance in any state where the applicant has conducted business during the past five years. Once the administrative hearing commission has reviewed the appeal, the administrative hearing commission shall issue a recommended decision to the commission on permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. The commission shall issue its own decision, based on the appeal, for permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. If the commission changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commission shall mail copies of its final decision to the parties to the appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the mine is located or is to be located shall have original jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available until and unless all administrative remedies are exhausted.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 1 § 13, A.L. 2015 H.B. 92)",

Every operator to whom a permit is issued pursuant to the provisions of sections 444.500 to 444.755 may engage in strip mining upon the lands described in the permit upon the performance of and subject to the following requirements with respect to such lands:\n\n(1) All ridges and peaks of overburden created by strip mining, except areas where lakes may be formed under subdivision (5) of subsection 1 of this section, or where washing, cleaning or retaining ponds and reservoirs may be formed under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section, shall be graded to a rolling topography traversable by farm machinery, but such slopes need not be reduced to less than the original grade of that area prior to mining, and the slope of the ridge of overburden resulting from a box cut need not be reduced to less than twenty-five degrees from horizontal whenever the same cannot be practically incorporated into the land reclaimed for wildlife purposes under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section. In strip mining all debris, trees, wood, logs, stones, rocks, coal, particles of coal, sandstone, or any other material or substance removed from the surface prior to mining or from the pit area during mining shall be finally disposed of to the satisfaction of the commission before the bond or any portion thereof be released.\n\n(2) In strip mining coal, the operator may set aside reasonable areas for the construction of ponds and reservoirs to be used during the mining operation for washing, cleaning, milling or otherwise preparing the product which need not be graded to a rolling topography. Such areas shall be constructed so that the dams, dikes and retaining structures shall be secure from washouts, erosion and structural failures and shall prevent the siltation of lands and waters below them, the pollution of the air by solid wastes, or the creation of a health or sanitation hazard or nuisance. Other than planned water impoundments, there shall be no depressions to accumulate water but lateral drainage ditches connecting to natural or constructed waterways shall be constructed whenever directed by the commission. As a means of controlling damaging runoff, the commission may require the operator to construct terraces or use such other measures and techniques as are necessary to control soil erosion and siltation on reclaimed land.\n\n(3) Up to and including twenty-five percent of the total acreage to be reclaimed each year need not be graded to a rolling topography except that all peaks and ridges shall be leveled off to a minimum width of thirty feet, if the land is reclaimed for wildlife purposes as required by the commission.\n\n(4) The commission shall not approve the application for a permit to conduct strip mining where such mining would endanger a residence, public building, school, church, cemetery, commercial or residential building, stream, lake, public road or other property. In the case of strip mining operations which remove and do not replace lateral support, unless mutually agreed upon by the operator and the adjacent property owner, the top of the consolidated material of the last open cut adjacent to the property line of other property not owned or leased by the operator shall, at the time mining is completed, not be closer to such other property line than a distance of twenty-five feet plus one and one-half times the depth of such cut as measured from original ground surface to the top of consolidated material. \"Consolidated material\" consists of materials of sufficient hardness or ability to resist weathering and to inhibit erosion or sloughing.\n\n(5) The operator may construct earth dams to form lakes in pits resulting from the final cut in a mining area; except that, the formation of the lakes shall not interfere with underground or other mining operations or damage adjoining property and shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this section.\n\n(6) The operator shall cover the exposed face of a mineral seam where acid forming materials are present, to a depth of not less than two feet with earth that will support plant life or with a permanent water impoundment, terraced or otherwise so constructed as to prevent a constant inflow of water from any stream and to prevent surface water from flowing into such impoundment, in such amounts as will cause runoff or spillage from said impoundment, in a volume which will cause kills of fish or animals downstream. Gob shall be covered to a depth of not less than two feet with earth or spoil material capable of supporting plant life.\n\n(7) The operator shall reclaim all affected lands except as otherwise provided in sections 444.500 to 444.755. The operator shall determine on company-owned land which parts of the affected land shall be reclaimed for forest, pasture, crop, horticultural, homesite, recreational, industrial or other use including food, shelter, and ground cover for wildlife, and shall show same by appropriate designation on the map filed pursuant to section 444.550. Where forest planting is shown on the map, the operator may elect whether the forest is to be hardwood or conifers, or both, and whether its future use is to be for lumber, pulpwood or some other purpose.\n\n(8) The operator, with the approval of the commission, shall sow, set out or plant upon the affected land described in the map, filed pursuant to section 444.550, seeds, plants, cuttings of trees, shrubs, grasses or legumes. The plantings or seedlings shall be appropriate to the type of reclamation designated by the operator on company-owned land and with the consent of the owner on leased land and shall be based upon the recommendations of technically trained foresters and agronomists.\n\n(9) Such other requirements as the commission may prescribe by rule or regulation to conform with the purposes and requirements of sections 444.500 to 444.755.\n\n2. An operator shall commence the reclamation of the area of land affected by its operation as soon as possible after the beginning of strip mining of that area in accordance with the plan of reclamation required by sections 444.500 to 444.755, the rules and regulations of the commission, the conditions of the permit, and shall complete grading within twelve months after the expiration date of the permit. The seeding and planting of supporting vegetation shall be completed within twenty-four months after the expiration date of the permit with survival of such supporting vegetation by the second growing season.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 1 § 14, A.L. 1976 S.B. 646, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1584)",

When more than one seam is to be mined, this information shall be included in the application, and the commission may defer reclamation until all seams have been mined, if such additional time does not defeat the purposes of sections 444.500 to 444.755 and there is no danger from acid mine drainage. Grading of a spoil ridge that will have an adjacent spoil ridge placed against it shall be completed one hundred eighty days after the placing of such adjacent spoil ridge. When heavy rains or other conditions make grading impracticable, the one hundred eighty day period shall be extended by the length of time such grading is impracticable.\n\n(2) With the approval of the commission, the operator may substitute for all or any part of the affected land to be reclaimed, an equal number of acres of land previously mined and not reclaimed. If any area is so substituted the operator shall submit a map of the substituted area, and this map shall conform to all requirements with respect to other maps required by section 444.550. The operator shall be relieved of all obligations under sections 444.500 to 444.755 with respect to the land for which substitution has been permitted.

Permit — application, contents, fees — amendment, how made — successor operator, duties of — fees expire, when. —1. Any operator desiring to engage in surface mining shall make written application to the director for a permit.\n\n2. Application for permit shall be made on a form prescribed by the commission and shall include:\n\n(1) The name of all persons with any interest in the land to be mined;\n\n(2) The source of the applicant's legal right to mine the land affected by the permit;\n\n(3) The permanent and temporary post office address of the applicant;\n\n(4) Whether the applicant or any person associated with the applicant holds or has held any other permits pursuant to sections 444.500 to 444.790, and an identification of such permits;\n\n(5) The written consent of the applicant and any other persons necessary to grant access to the commission or the director to the area of land affected under application from the date of application until the expiration of any permit granted under the application and thereafter for such time as is necessary to assure compliance with all provisions of sections 444.500 to 444.790 or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to them. Permit applications submitted by operators who mine an annual tonnage of less than ten thousand tons shall be required to include written consent from the operator to grant access to the commission or the director to the area of land affected;\n\n(6) A description of the tract or tracts of land and the estimated number of acres thereof to be affected by the surface mining of the applicant for the next succeeding twelve months; and\n\n(7) Such other information that the commission may require as such information applies to land reclamation.\n\n3. The application for a permit shall be accompanied by a map in a scale and form specified by the commission by regulation.\n\n4. The application shall be accompanied by a bond, security or certificate meeting the requirements of section 444.778, a geologic resources fee authorized under section 256.700, and a permit fee approved by the commission not to exceed one thousand dollars. The commission may also require a fee for each site listed on a permit not to exceed four hundred dollars for each site. If mining operations are not conducted at a site for six months or more during any year, the fee for such site for that year shall be reduced by fifty percent. The commission may also require a fee for each acre bonded by the operator pursuant to section 444.778 not to exceed twenty dollars per acre. If such fee is assessed, the per-acre fee on all acres bonded by a single operator that exceed a total of two hundred acres shall be reduced by fifty percent. In no case shall the total fee for any permit be more than three thousand dollars. Permit and renewal fees shall be established by rule, except for the initial fees as set forth in this subsection, and shall be set at levels that recover the cost of administering and enforcing sections 444.760 to 444.790, making allowances for grants and other sources of funds. The director shall submit a report to the commission and the public each year that describes the number of employees and the activities performed the previous calendar year to administer sections 444.760 to 444.790. For any operator of a gravel mining operation where the annual tonnage of gravel mined by such operator is less than five thousand tons, the total cost of submitting an application shall be three hundred dollars. The issued permit shall be valid from the date of its issuance until the date specified in the mine plan unless sooner revoked or suspended as provided in sections 444.760 to 444.790. Beginning August 28, 2007, the fees shall be set at a permit fee of eight hundred dollars, a site fee of four hundred dollars, and an acre fee of ten dollars, with a maximum fee of three thousand dollars. Fees may be raised as allowed in this subsection after a regulation change that demonstrates the need for increased fees.\n\n5. An operator desiring to have his or her permit amended to cover additional land may file an amended application with the commission. Upon receipt of the amended application, and such additional fee and bond as may be required pursuant to the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790, the director shall, if the applicant complies with all applicable regulatory requirements, issue an amendment to the original permit covering the additional land described in the amended application.\n\n6. An operation may withdraw any land covered by a permit, excepting affected land, by notifying the commission thereof, in which case the penalty of the bond or security filed by the operator pursuant to the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790 shall be reduced proportionately.\n\n7. Where mining or reclamation operations on acreage for which a permit has been issued have not been completed, the permit shall be renewed. The operator shall submit a permit renewal form furnished by the director for an additional permit year and pay a fee equal to an application fee calculated pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, but in no case shall the renewal fee for any operator be more than three thousand dollars. For any operator involved in any gravel mining operation where the annual tonnage of gravel mined by such operator is less than five thousand tons, the permit as to such acreage shall be renewed by applying on a permit renewal form furnished by the director for an additional permit year and payment of a fee of three hundred dollars. Upon receipt of the completed permit renewal form and fee from the operator, the director shall approve the renewal. With approval of the director and operator, the permit renewal may be extended for a portion of an additional year with a corresponding prorating of the renewal fee.\n\n8. Where one operator succeeds another at any uncompleted operation, either by sale, assignment, lease or otherwise, the commission may release the first operator from all liability pursuant to sections 444.760 to 444.790 as to that particular operation if both operators have been issued a permit and have otherwise complied with the requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790 and the successor operator assumes as part of his or her obligation pursuant to sections 444.760 to 444.790 all liability for the reclamation of the area of land affected by the former operator.\n\n9. The application for a permit shall be accompanied by a plan of reclamation that meets the requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790 and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and shall contain a verified statement by the operator setting forth the proposed method of operation, reclamation, and a conservation plan for the affected area including approximate dates and time of completion, and stating that the operation will meet the requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790, and any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to them.\n\n10. At the time that a permit application is deemed complete by the director, the operator shall publish a notice of intent to operate a surface mine in any newspaper qualified pursuant to section 493.050 to publish legal notices in any county where the land is located. If the director does not respond to a permit application within forty-five calendar days, the application shall be deemed to be complete. Notice in the newspaper shall be posted once a week for four consecutive weeks beginning no more than ten days after the application is deemed complete. The operator shall also send notice of intent to operate a surface mine by certified mail to the governing body of the counties or cities in which the proposed area is located, and to the last known addresses of all record landowners whose property is:\n\n(1) Within two thousand six hundred forty feet, or one-half mile from the border of the proposed mine plan area; and\n\n(2) Adjacent to the proposed mine plan area, land upon which the mine plan area is located, or adjacent land having a legal relationship with either the applicant or the owner of the land upon which the mine plan area is located.\n\n­­The notices shall include the name and address of the operator, a legal description consisting of county, section, township and range, the number of acres involved, a statement that the operator plans to mine a specified mineral during a specified time, and the address of the commission. The notices shall also contain a statement that any person with a direct, personal interest in one or more of the factors the director may consider in issuing a permit may request a public meeting or file written comments to the director no later than fifteen days following the final public notice publication date. If any person requests a public meeting, the applicant shall cooperate with the director in making all necessary arrangements for the public meeting to be held in a reasonably convenient location and at a reasonable time for interested participants, and the applicant shall bear the expenses.\n\n11. The director may approve a permit application or permit amendment whose operation or reclamation plan deviates from the requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790 if it can be demonstrated by the operator that the conditions present at the surface mining location warrant an exception. The criteria accepted for consideration when evaluating the merits of an exception or variance to the requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790 shall be established by regulations.\n\n*12.

Director to investigate applications — decision to issue or deny — denial of permit, appeal, procedure — commission to issue decision. —1. All applications for a permit shall be filed with the director, who shall promptly investigate the application and make a decision within six weeks after completion of the process provided in subsection 10 of section 444.772 to issue or deny the permit. If the director determines that the application has not fully complied with the provisions of section 444.772 or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to that section, the director may seek additional information from the applicant before making a decision to issue or deny the permit. The director shall consider any public comments when making the decision to issue or deny the permit. In issuing a permit, the director may impose reasonable conditions consistent with the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790. The director's decision shall be deemed to be the decision of the director of the department of natural resources and shall be subject to appeal to the administrative hearing commission as provided by sections 640.013 and 621.250.\n\n2. Whenever a surface mining operation permit provided under section 444.772 is issued, denied, suspended, or revoked by the department of natural resources, any aggrieved person, by petition filed with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the decision, may appeal such decision as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013. For purposes of an appeal, the administrative hearing commission may consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether an interested party's health, safety or livelihood will be unduly impaired by the issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation of the permit. The administrative hearing commission may also consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether the operator has demonstrated, during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the permit application, a pattern of noncompliance at other locations in Missouri that suggests a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In determining whether a reasonable likelihood of noncompliance will exist in the future, the administrative hearing commission may look to past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, but only to the extent they suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. Such past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, in and of themselves, are an insufficient basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In addition, such past acts shall not be used as a basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance unless the noncompliance has caused or has the potential to cause, a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. If a hearing petitioner demonstrates or the administrative hearing commission finds either present acts of noncompliance or a reasonable likelihood that the permit seeker or the operations of associated persons or corporations in Missouri will be in noncompliance in the future, such a showing will satisfy the noncompliance requirement in this subsection. In addition, such basis must be developed by multiple noncompliances of any environmental law administered by the Missouri department of natural resources at any single facility in Missouri that resulted in harm to the environment or impaired the health, safety or livelihood of persons outside the facility. For any permit seeker that has not been in business in Missouri for the past five years, the administrative hearing commission may review the record of noncompliance in any state where the applicant has conducted business during the past five years. The administrative hearing commission shall issue a recommended decision to the commission on permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. The commission shall issue its own decision, based on the appeal, for permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. If the commission changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commission shall mail copies of its final decision to the parties to the appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the mine is located or is to be located shall have original jurisdiction.

Every operator to whom a permit is issued pursuant to the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790 may engage in surface mining upon the lands described in the permit upon the performance of and subject to the following requirements with respect to such lands:\n\n(1) All ridges and peaks of overburden created by surface mining, except areas meeting the qualifications of subdivision (4) of this subsection, or where washing, cleaning or retaining ponds and reservoirs may be formed under subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be graded to a rolling topography traversable by farm machinery, but such slopes need not be reduced to less than the original grade of that area prior to mining, and the slope of the ridge of overburden resulting from a box cut need not be reduced to less than twenty-five degrees from horizontal whenever the same cannot be practically incorporated into the land reclaimed for wildlife purposes pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection. In surface mining the operator shall remove all debris and materials not allowed by the reclamation plan before the bond or any portion thereof may be released;\n\n(2) As a means of controlling damaging erosion, the director may require the operator to construct terraces or use such other measures and techniques as are necessary to control soil erosion and siltation on reclaimed land. Such erosion control measures and techniques may also be required on overburden stockpiles if the erosion is causing environmental damage outside the permit area. In determining the grading requirements to restore barite pit areas, the sidewalls of the excavation shall be graded to a point where it blends with the surrounding countryside, but in no case should the contour be such that erosion and siltation be increased;\n\n(3) In the surface mining of tar sands, the operator shall recover and collect all spent sands and other refuse yielded from the processing of tar sands, whether such spent sands and refuse are produced at the surface mine or elsewhere, in the manner prescribed by the commission as conditions of the permit, and shall finally dispose of such spent sands and refuse in the manner prescribed by the commission as conditions of the permit and in accordance with the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790;\n\n(4) Up to and including twenty-five percent of the total acreage to be reclaimed each year need not be graded to a rolling topography if the land is reclaimed for wildlife purposes as required by the commission, except that all peaks and ridges shall be leveled off to a minimum width of thirty feet or one-half the diameter of the base of the pile at the original ground surface whichever is less;\n\n(5) Surface mining operations that remove and do not replace the lateral support shall not, unless mutually agreed upon by the operator and the adjacent property owner, remove the lateral support in the vicinity of any established right-of-way line of any public road, street or highway closer than a distance equal to twenty-five feet plus one and one-half times the depth of the unconsolidated material from such right-of-way line to the beginning of the excavation; except that, unless granted a variance by the commission, the minimum distance is fifty feet. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to all existing surface mining operations beginning August 28, 1990, except as provided in subsection 3 of section 444.770;\n\n(6) If surface mining is or has been conducted up to the minimum distance as defined in subdivision (5) of this subsection along an established right-of-way line of any public road, street or highway, a barrier or berm of adequate height shall be placed or constructed along the perimeter of the excavation. Adequate height shall mean a height of no less than three feet. Such barriers or berms shall not be required if barriers, berms or guardrails already exist on the adjoining right-of-way. Barriers or berms of adequate height may also be required by the commission when surface mining is or has been conducted up to the minimum distance as defined in subdivision (5) of this subsection along other property lines, but only as necessary to mitigate serious and obvious threats to public safety;\n\n(7) The operator may construct earth dams to form lakes in pits resulting from the final cut in a mining area; except that, the formation of the lakes shall not interfere with underground or other mining operations or damage adjoining property and shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (8) of this subsection;\n\n(8) The operator shall cover the exposed face of a mineral seam where acid-forming materials are present to a depth of not less than two feet with earth that will support plant life or with a permanent water impoundment, terraced or otherwise so constructed as to prevent a constant inflow of water from any stream and to prevent surface water from flowing into such impoundment in such amounts as will cause runoff or spillage from said impoundment in a volume which will cause kills of fish or animals downstream. The operator shall cover an exposed deposit of tar sands, including an exposed face thereof, to a depth of not less than two feet with earth that will support plant life, and in addition may cover such deposit or face with a permanent water impoundment as provided above; however, no water impoundment shall be so constructed as to allow a permanent layer of oil or other hydrocarbon to collect on the surface of such impoundment in an amount which will adversely affect fish, wildfowl and other wildlife in or upon such impoundment;\n\n(9) The operator shall reclaim all affected lands except as otherwise provided in sections 444.760 to 444.790. The operator shall determine on company-owned land, and with the landowners on leased land for leases that are entered into after August 28, 1990, which parts of the affected land shall be reclaimed for forest, pasture, crop, horticultural, homesite, recreational, industrial or other use including food, shelter, and ground cover for wildlife;\n\n(10) The operator, with the approval of the commission, shall sow, set out or plant upon the affected land, seeds, plants, cuttings of trees, shrubs, grasses or legumes. The plantings or seedings shall be appropriate to the type of reclamation designated by the operator on company-owned land and with the owner on leased land for leases entered into after August 28, 1990, and shall be based upon sound agronomic and forestry principles;\n\n(11) Surface mining operations conducted in the flood plains of streams and rivers, and subject to periodic flooding, may be exempt from the grading requirements contained in this section if it can be demonstrated to the commission that such operations will be unsafe to pursue or ineffective in achieving reclamation required in this section because of the periodic flooding;\n\n(12) Such other requirements as the commission may prescribe by rule or regulation to conform with the purposes and requirements of sections 444.760 to 444.790.\n\n2. An operator shall commence the reclamation of the area of land affected by its operation as soon as possible after the completion of surface mining of viable mineral reserves in any portion of the permit area in accordance with the plan of reclamation required by subsection 9 of section 444.772, the rules and regulations of the commission, and the conditions of the permit. Grading shall be completed within twelve months after mining of viable mineral reserves is complete in that portion of the permit area based on the operator's prior mining practices at that site. Mining shall not be deemed complete if the operator can provide credible evidence to the director that viable mineral reserves are present. The seeding and planting of supporting vegetation, as provided in the reclamation plan, shall be completed within twenty-four months after with mining has been completed survival of such supporting vegetation by the second growing season.\n\n3. With the approval of the director, the operator may substitute for all or any part of the affected land to be reclaimed an equal number of acres of land previously mined and not reclaimed. If any area is so substituted the operator shall submit a map and reclamation plan of the substituted area, and this map and reclamation plan shall conform to all requirements with respect to other maps and reclamation plan required by section 444.772. The operator shall be relieved of all obligations pursuant to sections 444.760 to 444.790 with respect to the land for which substitution has been permitted. On leased land, the landowner shall grant written approval to the operator for substitutions made pursuant to this subsection.\n\n4. The operator shall file a report with the commission within sixty days after the date of expiration of a permit stating the exact number of acres of land affected by the operation, the extent of the reclamation already accomplished, and such other information as may be required by the commission.\n\n5. The operator shall ensure that all affected land where vegetation is to be reestablished is covered with enough topsoil or other approved material in order to provide a proper rooting medium. No topsoil or other approved material is required to be placed on areas described in subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section or on any areas to be reclaimed for industrial uses as specified in the reclamation plan.\n\n6. The commission may grant such additional time for meeting with the completion dates required by sections 444.760 to 444.790 as are necessary due to an act of God, war, strike, riot, catastrophe, or other good cause shown.\n\n(L. 1971 H.B. 519 § 7, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1584, A.L. 2001 H.B. 453, A.L. 2009 H.B. 246)",

The bond shall be signed by the operator as principal, and by a good and sufficient corporate surety, licensed to do business in this state, as surety. The operator shall file with the commission a bond payable to the state of Missouri with surety in the penal sum of eight thousand dollars for each permit up to eight acres and five hundred dollars for each acre thereafter that is to be mined. In addition, for each acre or portion thereof where topsoil has been removed from the site, an additional bond of four thousand five hundred dollars per acre shall be posted with the commission for each acre or portion thereof which will be revegetated, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in sections 444.760 to 444.790 and of the rules and regulations of the commission. In lieu of a surety bond, the operator may furnish a bond secured by a personal certificate of deposit or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to that of the required surety bond on conditions as prescribed by the commission. For any operator involved in any gravel mining operation where the annual tonnage of gravel mined by such operator is less than five thousand tons, such operator shall deposit a bond with the commission in the penal sum of five hundred dollars for each acre or portion thereof of land proposed thereafter by the operator to be subjected to surface mining for the mining permit year.\n\n2. The bond shall remain in effect until the mined acreages have been reclaimed, approved and released by the commission.

The commission shall have the power to reclaim, in keeping with the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790, any affected land with respect to which a bond has been forfeited. The commission and any other agency and any contractor under a contract with the commission shall have reasonable right of access to the land affected to carry out such reclamation. The operator shall also have the right of access to the land affected to carry out such reclamation and shall notify the landowner on lease holdings that such right exists.\n\n7. Whenever an operator shall have completed all requirements pursuant to the provisions of sections 444.760 to 444.790 as to any affected land, he or she shall notify the commission thereof. If the commission determines that the operator has completed the requirements, the commission shall release the operator from further obligations regarding the affected land and the penalty of the bond shall be reduced proportionately.\n\n(L. 1971 H.B. 519 § 9, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1584, A.L. 1993 H.B. 312 & 257, A.L. 2001 H.B. 453)",

An administrative penalty shall be paid within sixty days from the date of issuance of the order assessing the penalty. Any person subject to an administrative penalty may appeal to the commission. Any appeal will stay the due date of such administrative penalty until the appeal is resolved. Any person who fails to pay an administrative penalty by the final due date shall be liable to the state for a surcharge of fifteen percent of the penalty plus ten percent per annum on any amounts owed.

This law, sections 444.800 to 444.940, may be known and cited as the \"Surface Coal Mining Law\".\n\n2. The general assembly finds and declares that:\n\n(1) Extraction of coal from the earth can be accomplished by various methods of mining, including surface mining;\n\n(2) Coal mining operations presently contribute significantly to the state's energy requirements;\n\n(3) Many surface mining operations result in disturbances of surface areas that burden and adversely affect the public welfare by destroying or diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational, agricultural, and forestry purposes, by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property by degrading the quality of life in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources;\n\n(4) The expansion of coal mining to meet energy needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public; and\n\n(5) Surface mining and reclamation technology are now developed so that effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal mining operations is an appropriate and necessary means to minimize so far as practicable the adverse social, economic, and environmental effects of such mining operations.\n\n3. Therefore, it is the purpose of this law to:\n\n(1) Provide such regulation and control of surface coal mining as to minimize or prevent its injurious effects on the people and resources of the state;\n\n(2) Assure that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances thereto are fully protected from such operations;\n\n(3) Assure that surface coal mining operations are not conducted where reclamation is not feasible;\n\n(4) Assure that surface coal mining operations are so conducted as to protect the environment;\n\n(5) Assure that adequate procedures are undertaken to reclaim surface areas as contemporaneously as possible with the surface coal mining operations;\n\n(6) Assure that the coal supply essential to the state's energy requirements, and to its economic and social well-being is provided and strike a balance between protection of the environment and agricultural productivity and the need for coal as an essential source of energy;\n\n(7) Promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation prior to August 3, 1977, and which continue, in their unreclaimed condition, to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public;\n\n(8) Assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans, or programs.\n\n4. To that end, the commission is directed to rigidly enforce this law and to adopt whatever rules and regulations necessary to accomplish these purposes, but such rules and regulations shall be no more stringent than the comparable federal regulations promulgated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement under P.L. 95-87, the Federal Surface Coal Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, unless it can be affirmatively shown that such more stringent rule or regulation is essential to the proper administration and enforcement of this law.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 459, A.L. 1987 H.B. 669, A.L. 1995 S.B. 3)",

Any permittee who violates any permit condition or any provision of the reclamation plan or who violates any provision of this law or rules and regulations may be assessed an administrative penalty by the commission, except that if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order under section 444.885 the penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed five thousand dollars for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessments. In determining the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to the permittee's history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.\n\n2. An administrative penalty shall be assessed by the commission only after the person charged has been given an opportunity for a public hearing. When such a public hearing has been held, the commission shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall issue a written decision as to the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the commission shall consolidate such hearings with other proceedings under section 444.885. Any hearing under this section shall be of record and shall be a contested case. The chairman may designate one commission member as hearing officer, or may appoint a member in good standing of the Missouri bar as hearing officer to hold the hearing and make recommendations to the commission, but the commission shall make the final decision therein and any member participating in the decision shall review the record before making decision. Where the person charged with such a violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, an administrative penalty shall be assessed and ordered paid only after the commission has determined that a violation did occur and the amount of the penalty which is warranted.\n\n3. When the director believes that a violation has occurred he may, or if a cessation order has resulted he shall, file with the commission and serve the operator by registered mail a notice charging a violation has occurred and setting forth the proposed amount of said penalty. The operator, if he wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, may within thirty days of receipt of the notice request a hearing before the commission. The operator shall, with such request, file with the commission a penalty bond in the amount of the proposed penalty, in a form prescribed by the commission, with security attached in the form of a certificate of deposit, conditioned upon forfeiture upon a final nonappealable decision. If through administrative or judicial review, it is determined that no violation occurred, or that the amount of the penalty should be reduced, the commission shall within thirty days of such determination release said bond and remit the appropriate amount to the person, with interest at the rate of six percent, or at the prevailing United States Department of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater. Failure to file the bond with the request for hearing shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.\n\n4. Administrative penalties, plus interest at the rate of six percent, or at the prevailing United States Department of the Treasury rate, whichever is greater, plus attorney's fees, may be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general at the request of the commission in the county where the violation occurred or in Cole County.\n\n5. Any person who willfully and knowingly violates a condition of a permit or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under section 444.885 or section 444.900, or any order incorporated in a final decision issued by the commission, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under subsection 2 of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\n\n6. Whenever a corporate permittee violates a condition of a permit or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under section 444.885, or any order incorporated in a final decision issued by the commission, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under subsection 2 of this section, any director, officer, or agent of such corporation who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or refusal shall be subject to the same administrative penalties, fines and imprisonment that may be imposed upon a person under subsections 1 and 5 of this section.\n\n7. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\n\n8. Any operator who fails to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued under subsection 1 of section 444.885 within the period permitted for its correction (which period shall not end until the entry of a final order by the commission, in the case of any review proceedings under section 444.895 initiated by the operator wherein the commission orders, after an expedited hearing, the suspension of the abatement requirements of the citation after determining that the operator will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of those requirements, or until the entry of an order of the court, in the case of any review proceedings under section 444.900 initiated by the operator wherein the court orders the suspension of the abatement requirements of the citation) shall be assessed an administrative penalty by the commission of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars, nor more than five thousand dollars for each day during which such failure or*violation continues.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 459, A.L. 1991 S.B. 45, A.L. 1993 H.B. 312 & 257)\n\n*Word \"of\" appears in original rolls.",

The permittee may file a request with the commission for the release of all or part of a performance bond or deposit. Within thirty days after any application for bond release has been filed, the operator shall submit a copy of an advertisement placed at least once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the surface coal mining operation. Such advertisement shall be considered part of any bond release application and shall contain a notification of the precise location of the land affected, the number of acres, the permit and the date approved, the amount of the bond filed and the portion sought to be released, and the type and appropriate dates of reclamation work performed, and a description of the results achieved as they relate to the operator's approved reclamation plan. In addition, as part of any bond release application, the applicant shall submit copies of letters which he has sent to adjoining property owners, local governmental bodies, planning agencies, sewage and water treatment authorities, and water companies in the locality in which the surface coal mining and reclamation activities took place, notifying them of his intention to seek release from the bond. At the time of final or phase III bond release submittal, the operator shall include evidence that an affidavit has been recorded with the recorder of deeds in the county where the mined land is located, generally describing the parcel or parcels of land where operations such as underground mining, auger mining, covering of slurry ponds, or other underground activities occurred which could impact or limit future use of that land. This requirement shall be applicable to mined land where phase I reclamation was completed on or after September 1, 1992.\n\n2. Upon receipt of the notification and request, the commission shall cause to be conducted within thirty days an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work involved. Such evaluation shall consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty to complete any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water is occurring, the probability of continuance or future occurrence of such pollution, and the estimated cost of abating such pollution. The commission shall notify the permittee in writing of its decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond or deposit within sixty days from the filing of the request, if no public hearing is held pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, and if there has been a public hearing held pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, within thirty days thereafter.\n\n3. The commission may release in whole or in part said bond or deposit if satisfied the reclamation covered by the bond or deposit or portion thereof has been accomplished according to the following schedule:\n\n(1) When the operator completes the backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of a bonded area in accordance with his approved reclamation plan, the release of not more than sixty percentum of the bond or deposit for the applicable permit area;\n\n(2) After revegetation has been established on the regraded mined lands in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the release of a portion of the bond or deposit may be approved. When determining the amount of bond to be released after successful revegetation has been established, the commission shall retain that amount of bond for the revegetated area which would be sufficient for a third party to cover the cost of reestablishing revegetation for the period specified for operator responsibility in section 444.855 for reestablishing revegetation. No part of the bond or deposit shall be released under this subdivision so long as the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of the requirements set by subdivision (10) of subsection 2 of section 444.855 or until soil productivity for prime farm lands has returned to equivalent levels of yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from the soil survey performed pursuant to subdivision (16) of subsection 2 of section 444.820. Where a silt dam is to be retained as a permanent impoundment pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection 2 of section 444.855, the portion of bond may be released under this subdivision so long as provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner have been made with the commission;\n\n(3) When the operator has completed successfully all surface coal mining and reclamation activities, the release of the remaining portion of the bond, but not before the expiration of the period specified for operator responsibility in section 444.855; provided, however, that no bond shall be fully released until all reclamation requirements are fully met.\n\n4. If the commission disapproves the application for release of the bond or portion thereof, the commission shall notify the permittee, in writing, stating the reasons for disapproval and recommending corrective actions necessary to secure said release and allowing opportunity for a public hearing unless a hearing has been held.\n\n5. When any application for total or partial bond release is filed, the commission shall notify the county and/or municipality in which a surface coal mining operation is located by certified mail within thirty days from the date the application is filed.\n\n6. Any person with a valid legal interest which might be adversely affected by release of the bond or the responsible officer or head of any federal, state, or local governmental agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental, social, or economic impact involved in the operation, or is authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards with respect to such operations shall have the right to file written objections to the proposed release from bond within sixty days after the application was filed. If written objections are filed, and a hearing requested, the commission shall inform all the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, and the date, time, and location of such public hearing shall be advertised by the commission in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality for two consecutive weeks, and the commission shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the surface coal mining operation proposed for bond release or in Cole County, at the option of the objector, within ninety days after the application has been filed.\n\n7. For the purpose of such hearing the commission shall have the authority and is hereby empowered to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses or written or printed materials, compel the attendance of witnesses, or production of the materials, and take evidence including, but not limited to, inspections of the land affected and other surface coal mining operations carried on by the applicant in the general vicinity. A verbatim record of each public hearing shall be made, and a transcript made available on the motion of any party or by order of the commission.

Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the commission or the director or any authorized representative determines that the condition, practice or violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by the commission or the director pursuant to subsection 4 of this section. Where the commission or the director or any authorized representative finds that the ordered cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or any portion thereof, will not completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the commission or director or authorized agent shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator requiring him to take whatever steps deemed necessary to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.\n\n2.

Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the commission or the director determines that the violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by the commission or the director pursuant to subsection 4 of this section. In the order of cessation the commission or director shall determine the steps necessary to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible, and shall include the necessary measures in the order.\n\n3. When the commission or the director determines that a pattern of violations of any requirements of this law, regulations, or any permit conditions exist or have existed, and if the commission or the director also finds that such violations are caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with any requirements of this law, regulations, or any permit conditions, or that such violations are willfully caused by the permittee, the commission or the director shall forthwith issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked and shall provide opportunity for a public hearing. If a hearing is requested the commission shall inform all interested parties of the time and place of the hearing. Upon the permittee's failure to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the commission shall forthwith suspend or revoke the permit.\n\n4. Notices and orders issued pursuant to this section shall set forth with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation and the remedial action required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which the notice or order applies.

After a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected has filed a petition and before the hearing, any person may intervene by filing allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within sixty days after such hearing, the commission shall issue and furnish to the petitioner, and any other party to the hearing, a written decision regarding the petition, and the reasons therefor. In the event that all the petitioners stipulate agreement prior to the requested hearing, and withdraw their request, such hearing need not be held.\n\n3.

Upon receipt of such application, the commission shall cause such investigation to be made as it deems appropriate and shall set the matter for public hearing no later than thirty days from the date of application to enable the applicant or such person to present information relating to the issuance and continuance of such notice or order or the modification, vacation, or termination thereof. The filing of an application for review shall not operate as a stay of any order or notice.\n\n(2) The permittee and other interested persons shall be given written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least five days prior thereto.

Where the application for review concerns an order for cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations issued pursuant to the provisions of section 444.885, the commission shall issue the written decision within thirty days of the application for review unless temporary relief has been granted by the commission pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.\n\n3. Pending completion of the investigation and hearing required by this section, the applicant may file with the commission a written request that the commission grant temporary relief from any notice or order issued under section 444.885 together with a detailed statement giving reasons for granting such relief. The commission shall issue an order or decision granting or denying such relief expeditiously; provided, that where the applicant requests relief from an order for cessation of coal mining and reclamation operations issued pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 of section 444.885, the order or decision on such a request shall be issued within five days of its receipt. The commission may grant such relief, under such conditions as it may prescribe, if:\n\n(1) A hearing has been held in the locality of the permit area on the request for temporary relief in which all parties were given an opportunity to be heard;\n\n(2) The applicant shows that there is substantial likelihood that the findings of the commission will be favorable to him; and\n\n(3) Such relief will not adversely affect the health or safety of the public or cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.\n\n4. Following the issuance of an order to show cause as to why a permit should not be suspended or revoked pursuant to section 444.885, the commission shall hold a public hearing after giving written notice of the time, place, and date thereof. Any such hearing shall be of record. Within sixty days following the public hearing, the commission shall issue and furnish to the permittee and all other parties to the hearing a written decision, and the reasons therefor, concerning suspension or revocation of the permit. If the commission revokes the permit, the permittee shall immediately cease surface coal mining operations on the permit area and shall complete reclamation within a period specified by the commission, or the commission shall declare as forfeited the performance bonds for the operation.\n\n5.

An applicant shall, consistent with the timing provided for in subsection 1 of section 444.830, file a phase I reclamation bond pursuant to this section. The phase I reclamation bond shall be a minimum of two thousand five hundred dollars per permitted acre for every acre permitted and bonded on August 28, 1993, unless the phase I reclamation bond has been released pursuant to section 444.875, except that it shall be a minimum of ten thousand dollars per acre for the coal preparation area. The phase I reclamation bond for areas other than coal preparation areas may be adjusted annually by the commission based upon calculations conducted by the director, but shall not be increased by more than two hundred fifty dollars per year per acre or a maximum of five thousand dollars per acre. The phase I bond for coal preparation areas may also be adjusted annually by the commission based upon calculations conducted by the director, but shall not be increased by more than five hundred dollars per year per acre or a maximum of fifteen thousand dollars per acre. The changes shall be proposed by the commission through the normal rulemaking process. The calculations of the minimum phase I reclamation bond amount required shall depend upon the reclamation requirements of the approved permits, and shall reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to such factors as site topography, geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential. In no case shall the phase I reclamation bond be less than ten thousand dollars per permit, except that for those operators with less than one thousand bonded acres, the minimum bond shall be the equivalent of twenty acres of phase I reclamation bond for each acre of open pit, as determined by the approved mining plan. For the purposes of this section, the open pit shall be the area between the crest of the highwall to the toe of the spoil.\n\n2. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of this chapter shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of section 536.024.\n\n3. The phase I reclamation bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state, except that the operator may elect to deposit cash, irrevocable letters of credit, negotiable bonds of the United States government or of the state of Missouri, or negotiable certificates of deposit of any bank organized or transacting business in the United States. The cash deposit or market value of such securities shall be equal to or greater than the amount of the bond required for the bonded area.\n\n4. The commission may accept the phase I reclamation bond of the applicant himself without the separate surety provided for in subsection 3*of this section when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commission the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process and a history of financial solvency and continuous operation sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond such amount or, in lieu of the establishment of a bonding program, as set forth in this section, the commission may adopt an alternative system that will achieve the objectives and purposes of the bonding program pursuant to this section, and which is consistent with or pursuant to the purposes of P.L. 95-87, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.\n\n5. Liability under the phase I reclamation bond will continue until the commission determines that phase I reclamation has been completed, whereupon the commission may release no less than eighty percent of the phase I reclamation bond.

Any portion of the fund not immediately needed to pay for reclamation work shall be deposited by the state treasurer in interest-bearing accounts in the same manner as other state funds are so deposited, and the interest earned thereon shall be credited to the fund.\n\n3. The fund shall be allowed to accumulate until it reaches the greater of seven million dollars or two thousand five hundred dollars times the number of acres within the state that have been mined but which have not been released by the commission as having been reclaimed.

For permittees who file phase I reclamation bonds, the assessment shall be paid monthly by each permittee based on coal sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of. The assessment shall be paid at the rate of forty-five cents per ton for the first fifty thousand tons sold, shipped or otherwise disposed of in a calendar year, and thirty cents per ton for the next fifty thousand tons sold, shipped or otherwise disposed of in such calendar year. Thereafter, during any calendar year, no further assessment shall be due for that permittee.\n\n3. Whenever the total balance in the fund exceeds seven million dollars as of the close of the state's fiscal year, no assessments shall be required during the state's next fiscal year except that each new permittee filing a phase I reclamation bond pursuant to section 444.950 shall pay assessments pursuant to section 444.960 and this section until the permittee's payments equal those made by an existing permittee of comparable size. Whenever the fund balance is less than seven million dollars at the close of the state's fiscal year, all permittees who have elected to file phase I reclamation bonds pursuant to section 444.950 shall pay assessments to the fund as provided for in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. After the date when enough moneys have accumulated in the forty percent pool to complete reclamation on sites revoked prior to September 1, 1988, whenever the fund balance falls below seven million dollars, the tonnage assessments provided for in subsection 2 of this section shall resume at the rate of twenty-five cents per ton for the first fifty thousand tons and fifteen cents per ton for the second fifty thousand tons of coal sold, shipped or otherwise disposed of in a calendar year by a permittee.

      "text": "Title XXIX OWNERSHIP AND CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY\n\nChapter 444\n\n444.980. Appeal of permit decision, procedure. —Whenever a surface coal mining operation permit provided under section 444.815 or a coal exploration operation permit provided under section 444.845 is issued, denied, suspended, or revoked by the department of natural resources, any aggrieved person, by petition filed with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the decision, may appeal such decision as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013. For purposes of an appeal, the administrative hearing commission may consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether an interested party's health, safety, or livelihood will be unduly impaired by the issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation of the permit. The administrative hearing commission may also consider, based on competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether the operator has demonstrated, during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the permit application, a pattern of noncompliance at other locations in Missouri that suggests a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In determining whether a reasonable likelihood of noncompliance will exist in the future, the administrative hearing commission may look to past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, but only to the extent they suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. Such past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, in and of themselves, are an insufficient basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In addition, such past acts shall not be used as a basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance unless the noncompliance has caused or has the potential to cause a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. If a hearing petitioner demonstrates or the administrative hearing commission finds either present acts of noncompliance or a reasonable likelihood that the permit seeker or the operations of associated persons or corporations in Missouri will be in noncompliance in the future, such a showing will satisfy the noncompliance requirement in this section*. In addition, such basis must be developed by multiple noncompliances of any environmental law administered by the Missouri department of natural resources at any single facility in Missouri that resulted in harm to the environment or impaired the health, safety, or livelihood of persons outside the facility. For any permit seeker that has not been in business in Missouri for the past five years, the administrative hearing commission may review the record of noncompliance in any state where the applicant has conducted business during the past five years. Once the administrative hearing commission has reviewed the appeal, the administrative hearing commission shall issue a recommended decision to the commission on permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. The commission shall issue its own decision, based on the appeal, for permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. If the commission changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commission shall mail copies of its final decision to the parties to the appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the mine is located or is to be located shall have original jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available until and unless all administrative remedies are exhausted.\n\n(L. 2015 H.B. 92)\n\n*Word \"subsection\" appears in original rolls.",
