If a majority of the votes cast by the qualified voters voting are opposed to the proposal, then the governing body of the fire protection district shall not impose the sales tax authorized in this section unless and until the governing body of the fire protection district resubmits a proposal to authorize the governing body of the fire protection district to impose the sales tax authorized by this section and such proposal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting thereon.\n\n3. All revenue received by a fire protection district from the tax authorized pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited in a special trust fund and shall be used solely for the operation of the fire protection district.\n\n4. All sales taxes collected by the director of revenue pursuant to this section on behalf of any fire protection district, less one percent for cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund after payment of premiums for surety bonds as provided in section 32.087, shall be deposited in the fire protection sales tax trust fund established pursuant to section 321.242. The moneys in the fire protection sales tax trust fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the trust and which was collected in each fire protection district imposing a sales tax pursuant to this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of the fire protection district and the public. Not later than the tenth day of each month, the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the trust fund during the preceding month to the fire protection district which levied the tax. Such funds shall be deposited with the treasurer of each such fire protection district, and all expenditures of funds arising from the fire protection sales tax trust fund shall be for the operation of the fire protection district and for no other purpose.\n\n5. The director of revenue may make refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to any fire protection district for erroneous payments and overpayments made and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such fire protection districts. If any fire protection district abolishes the tax, the fire protection district shall notify the director of revenue of the action at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the repeal and the director of revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such fire protection district, the director of revenue shall remit the balance in the account to the fire protection district and close the account of that fire protection district. The director of revenue shall notify each fire protection district of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the fire protection district. In the event a tax within a fire protection district is approved under this section, and such fire protection district is dissolved, the tax shall lapse on the date that the fire protection district is dissolved and the proceeds from the last collection of such tax shall be distributed to the governing bodies of the counties formerly containing the fire protection district and the proceeds of the tax shall be used for fire protection services within such counties.\n\n6. Except as modified in this section, all provisions of sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed pursuant to this section.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 21, A.L. 2017 S.B. 112, A.L. 2023 S.B. 186)",

The boundaries may be changed as follows:\n\n(1) Twenty-five percent of the number of voters who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the area to be annexed may file with the board a petition in writing praying that such real property be included within the district; provided that in the case of a municipality having less than twenty percent of its total population in one fire protection district, the entire remaining portion may be included in another district so that none of the city is outside of a fire protection district at the time. The petition shall describe the property to be included in the district and shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the inclusion in the district of the property described in the petition; and such petition shall be in substantially the form set forth in section 321.495 dealing with referendums and verified in like manner; provided, however, that in the event that there are more than twenty-five property owners or taxpaying electors signing the petition, it shall be deemed sufficient description of their property in the petition as required in this section to list the addresses of such property; or\n\n(2) All of the owners of any territory or tract of land near or adjacent to a fire protection district who own all of the real estate in such territory or tract of land may file a petition with the board praying that such real property be included in the district. The petition shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the inclusion in the district of the property described in the petition;\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in any fire protection district which is partly or wholly located in a noncharter county of the first classification with a population of less than one hundred thousand which adjoins any county of the first classification with a charter form of government with a population of nine hundred thousand or more inhabitants, if such fire protection district serves any portion of a city which is located in both such counties, the boundaries of the district may be expanded so as to include the entire city within the fire protection district, but the boundaries of the district shall not be expanded beyond the city limits of such city, as the boundaries of such city existed on January 1, 1993. Such change in the boundaries of the district shall be accomplished only if twenty-five percent of the number of voters who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the area to be annexed file with the board a petition in writing praying that such real property be included within the district. The petition shall describe the property to be included in the district and shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the inclusion in the district of the property described in the petition; and such petition shall be in substantially the form set forth in section 321.495 dealing with referendums and verified in like manner.\n\n3. The secretary of the board shall cause notice of the filing of any petition filed pursuant to this section to be given and published in the county in which the property is located, which notice shall recite the filing of such petition, the number of petitioners, a general description of the boundaries of the area proposed to be included and the prayer of the petitioners; giving notice to all persons interested to appear at the office of the board at the time named in the notice and show cause in writing, if any they have, why the petition should not be granted. The board shall at the time and place mentioned, or at such time or times to which the hearing may be adjourned, proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto presented in writing by any person showing cause why the petition should not be granted.

If the petition is granted, the board shall make an order to that effect and file the same with the circuit clerk; and upon the order of the court having jurisdiction over the district, the property shall be included in the district. If the petition contains the signatures of all the owners of the property pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section, the property shall be included in the district upon the order of the court. If the petition contains the signatures of twenty-five percent of the number of voters who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the area to be annexed pursuant to subdivision (1) or subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the property shall be included in the district subject to the election provided in section 321.301. The circuit court having jurisdiction over the district shall proceed to make any such order including such additional property within the district as is provided in the order of the board, unless the court shall find that such order of the board was not authorized by law or that such order of the board was not supported by competent and substantial evidence.\n\n5. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board made pursuant to the provisions of this section may appeal that decision to the circuit court of the county in which the property is located within thirty days of the decision by the board.\n\n6.

The provisions of this section shall not apply in any county of the first class having a charter form of government and having a population of over nine hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\n4. The provisions of this section shall not apply where the annexing city or town operates a city fire department and was on January 1, 2005, a city of the fourth classification with more than eight thousand nine hundred but fewer than nine thousand inhabitants and entirely surrounded by a single fire district. In such cases, the provision of fire and emergency medical services following annexation shall be governed by subsections 2 and 3 of section 72.418.\n\n5. The provisions of this section shall not apply where the annexing city or town operates a city fire department, is any city of the third classification with more than six thousand but fewer than seven thousand inhabitants and located in any county with a charter form of government and with more than two hundred thousand but fewer than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants, and is entirely surrounded by a single fire protection district.

III, Sec. 23, of the Missouri Constitution (see 2016 annotation below), rendering the repeal and reenactment of this section ineffective.\n\n(2016) Combination of six listed criteria in description contained in subsection 4 of section targets a specific political subdivision and thus constitutes a special law in violation of article III, section 40; no substantial justification for its enactment was provided.
