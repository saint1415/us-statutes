A license shall not be granted if the applicant has not established the applicant's good repute and moral character or if the applicant has pled guilty to, or has been convicted of, a felony. No licensee shall employ or contract with any person who has pled guilty to, or has been convicted of, a felony to perform any duties directly connected with the licensee's privileges under a license granted pursuant to this section, except that employees performing nongaming related occupations as determined by the commission shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection.\n\n9. Except as provided in section 313.817, a licensee shall not lend to any person money or any other thing of value for the purpose of permitting that person to wager on any gambling game authorized by law. This does not prohibit credit card or debit card transactions or cashing of checks. Any check cashed, other than a credit instrument, shall be deposited within twenty-four hours. Except for any credit instrument, the commission may require licensees to verify a sufficient account balance exists before cashing any check. Any licensee who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to an administrative penalty of five thousand dollars for each violation. Such administrative penalties shall be assessed and collected by the commission.\n\n10. (1) Gambling excursions including the operation of gambling games on an excursion gambling boat which is not continuously docked shall be allowed only on the Mississippi River and the Missouri River. No license to conduct gambling games on an excursion gambling boat in a city or county shall be issued unless and until the qualified voters of the city or county approve such activities pursuant to this subsection. The question shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the city or county at a general, primary or special election upon the motion of the governing body of the city or county or upon the petition of fifteen percent of the qualified voters of the city or county determined on the basis of the number of votes cast for governor in the city or county at the last election held prior to the filing of the petition.\n\n(2) The question shall be submitted in substantially the following form:\n\n(3) If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the commission may license excursion gambling boats in that city or county and such boats may operate on the Mississippi River and the Missouri River. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the question, then the commission shall not license such excursion gambling boats in such city or county unless and until the question is again submitted to and approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the city or county at a later election. Excursion gambling boats may only dock in a city or unincorporated area of a county which approves licensing of such excursion gambling boats pursuant to this subsection, but gambling operations may be conducted at any point on the Mississippi River or the Missouri River during an excursion. Those cities and counties which have approved by election pursuant to this subsection, except those cities or counties which have subsequently rejected by election, the licensing of any type of excursion gambling boats in the city or county prior to April 6, 1994, are exempt from any local election requirement of this section as such previous election shall have the same effect as if held after May 20, 1994.\n\n11. If a docking fee is charged by a city or a county, a licensee operating an excursion gambling boat shall pay the docking fee prior to the start of the excursion season.\n\n12. Any licensee shall not be delinquent in the payment of property taxes or other taxes or fees or in the payment of any other contractual obligation or debt due or owed to the state or a political subdivision of the state.\n\n13. An excursion gambling boat licensed by the state shall meet all of the requirements of chapter 306 and is subject to an inspection of its sanitary facilities to protect the environment and water quality by the commission or its designee before a license to operate an excursion gambling boat is issued by the commission. Licensed excursion gambling boats shall also be subject to such inspections during the period of the license as may be deemed necessary by the commission. The cost of such inspections shall be paid by the licensee.\n\n14. A holder of any license shall be subject to imposition of penalties, suspension or revocation of such license, or if the person is an applicant for licensure, the denial of the application, for any act or failure to act by such person or such person's agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the state of Missouri, or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Missouri gaming industry or the state of Missouri unless the licensee proves by clear and convincing evidence that it is not guilty of such action. The commission shall take appropriate action against any licensee who violates the law or the rules and regulations of the commission. Without limiting other provisions of this subsection, the following acts or omissions may be grounds for such discipline:\n\n(1) Failing to comply with or make provision for compliance with sections 313.800 to 313.850, the rules and regulations of the commission or any federal, state or local law or regulation;\n\n(2) Failing to comply with any rule, order or ruling of the commission or its agents pertaining to gaming;\n\n(3) Receiving goods or services from a person or business entity who does not hold a supplier's license but who is required to hold such license by the provisions of sections 313.800 to 313.850 or the rules and regulations of the commission;\n\n(4) Being suspended or ruled ineligible or having a license revoked or suspended in any state of gaming jurisdiction;\n\n(5) Associating with, either socially or in business affairs, or employing persons of notorious or unsavory reputation or who have extensive police records, or who have failed to cooperate with any officially constituted investigatory or administrative body and would adversely affect public confidence and trust in gaming;\n\n(6) Employing in any gambling games' operation or any excursion gambling boat operation, any person known to have been found guilty of cheating or using any improper device in connection with any gambling game;\n\n(7) Use of fraud, deception, misrepresentation or bribery in securing any permit or license issued pursuant to sections 313.800 to 313.850;\n\n(8) Obtaining or attempting to obtain any fee, charge, or other compensation by fraud, deception, or misrepresentation;\n\n(9) Incompetence, misconduct, gross negligence, fraud, misrepresentation or dishonesty in the performance of the functions or duties regulated by sections 313.800 to 313.850.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 149 § 6 Adopted by Referendum, Proposition A, November 3, 1992, A.L. 1993 S.B. 10 & 11 § 6, A.L. 1994 S.B. 740, A.L. 2000 S.B. 902, A.L. 2014 S.B. 741, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26)\n\n(1995) Section does not expressly or implicitly prohibit a second local option election on riverboat gambling after a prior affirmative election, therefore, section does not preclude a subsequent local option election after a prior affirmative election.

Except as permitted in this section, the licensee licensed to operate gambling games shall permit no form of wagering on gambling games.\n\n2. The licensee may receive wagers only from a person present on a licensed excursion gambling boat.\n\n3. Wagering shall not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. The licensee shall exchange the money or credit instrument of each wagerer for electronic or physical tokens, chips, or other forms of credit to be wagered on the gambling games. The licensee shall exchange the tokens, chips, or other forms of wagering credit for money at the request of the wagerer.\n\n4.

A licensee may accept credit instruments from a qualified person in exchange for currency, chips, tokens, or electronic tokens that can be wagered on gambling games at the licensee's excursion gambling boat. For the purposes of this subsection,\"qualified person\"means a person who has completed a credit application provided by the licensee and who is determined by the licensee, after performing a credit check and applying usual standards to establish creditworthiness, to qualify for a line of credit and in an amount to be determined by the licensee under the restrictions in subsection 9 of this section based on such person's demand deposit account or accounts, including any checking account and savings account. Once the licensee makes the determination that a person is a qualified person, additional credit checks are not required. Approval to accept a credit instrument from a qualified person shall be made by the holder of an occupational license. If a new credit instrument is issued to consolidate or replace an existing credit instrument or instruments, the new credit instrument shall use the oldest date of the credit instrument or instruments being replaced. A lost or destroyed credit instrument shall remain valid and enforceable if the party seeking enforcement can prove its existence and terms. Any person who violates this subsection is subject only to the penalties provided in section 313.812. The commission shall have no authority to determine the validity or enforceability of a credit instrument or the enforceability of the debt that the credit instrument represents. Failure to comply with any regulation promulgated by the commission shall not impact the validity or enforceability of the credit instrument or the debt that the credit instrument represents.\n\n9. In addition to the other creditor protections contained in this section, a licensee shall not lend anything of value or extend credit to any person for the purpose of permitting that person to wager on any gambling game except through the use of a credit instrument.
