Denial of license for criminal conviction, prohibited when, effect. —No board or other agency created pursuant to laws of the state of Missouri, or by any city, county or other political subdivision of the state, for the purpose of licensing applicants for occupations and professions may deny a license to an applicant primarily upon the basis that a felony or misdemeanor conviction of the applicant precludes the applicant from demonstrating good moral character, where the conviction resulted in the applicant's incarceration and the applicant has been released by pardon, parole or otherwise from such incarceration, or resulted in the applicant being placed on probation and there is no evidence the applicant has violated the conditions of his probation. The board or other agency may consider the conviction as some evidence of an absence of good moral character, but shall also consider the nature of the crime committed in relation to the license which the applicant seeks, the date of the conviction, the conduct of the applicant since the date of the conviction and other evidence as to the applicant's character.\n\n(L. 1981 S.B. 125 § 1)",
