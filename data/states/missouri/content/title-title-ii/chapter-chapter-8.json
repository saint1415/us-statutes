The fund shall consist of moneys paid to the authority and not pledged to the payment of bonds or otherwise obligated or any other moneys deposited to the fund by the authority. Such moneys shall include but are not limited to payments received from the master settlement agreement which are not pledged to the payment of bonds or which are subsequently released from a pledge to the payment of any bonds; payments which, in accordance with any sales agreement with the state, are to be paid to the state and not pledged to the bonds, including that portion of the proceeds of any bonds designated for purchase of a portion of the state's share, which are designated for deposit in the fund, together with all interest, dividends, and rents on the bonds; and all securities or investment income and other assets acquired by and through the use of the moneys belonging to the fund and any other moneys deposited in the fund. Moneys in the fund are to be used solely and only as provided in this section, and shall not be used for any other purpose. Such moneys shall not be available for the payment of any claim against the authority or any debt or obligation of the authority.\n\n2. There shall be established within the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund a \"qualified tax-exempt expenditure account\" and a \"taxable expenditure account\". The net proceeds of all tax-exempt bonds shall be deposited in the qualified tax-exempt expenditure account. The net proceeds of all taxable bonds shall be deposited in the taxable expenditure account. Moneys deposited in the qualified tax-exempt expenditure account shall be used to pay or reimburse the state for expenditures which are permissible under federal tax law governing tax-exempt bonds. Upon such reimbursement or use such moneys shall be transferred by the authority to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general revenue fund and applied as provided in subsection 4 of this section or to such other fund as may be provided by law. Moneys deposited in the taxable expenditure account shall, upon direction of the authority, be transferred to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general revenue fund or to such other fund as may be provided by law.\n\n3. For the purpose of maximizing the amount of tax-exempt bonds to be issued, the governor or an authorized designee may evidence in writing the state's intent to finance any state expenditure from the proceeds of bonds either by directly funding such expenditure or through reimbursement of amounts originally funded from another source. An allocation of proceeds of bonds to finance any expenditure originally funded from another source may be evidenced by a written statement signed by the governor or an authorized designee. Upon such allocation, the amount allocated shall be deposited to the general revenue fund of the state and thereafter may be appropriated for any purpose. The treasurer of the authority shall act as custodian and trustee of the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund and shall administer the fund as directed by the authority. The treasurer of the authority shall do all of the following: hold, invest and disburse funds; sell any securities or other property held by the fund and reinvest the proceeds as directed by the authority, when deemed advisable by the authority for the protection of the fund or the preservation of the value of the investment; subscribe, at the direction of the authority, for the purchase of securities for future delivery in anticipation of future income; and pay for securities, as directed by the authority, upon the receipt of the purchasing entity's paid statement or paid confirmation of purchase. Any sale of securities or other property held by the fund under this subsection shall only be made with the advice of the board in the manner and to the extent provided in sections 8.500 to 8.565 with regard to the purchase of investments.\n\n4. All moneys paid to or deposited in the fund are available to the authority to be used in accordance with sections 8.500 to 8.565, including but not limited to all of the following:\n\n(1) For payment of amounts due to the state pursuant to the terms of the sales agreements entered into between the state and the authority;\n\n(2) For purposes of paying or reimbursing the state for expenditures which are permissible under federal tax law governing tax-exempt bonds; provided, such moneys are transferred at the time of such payment or reimbursement to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general revenue fund and used by the state treasurer solely to pay the costs of implementing the program plan;\n\n(3) For transfer to the state general revenue fund for the payment of the costs of implementing the program plan;\n\n(4) To make interim transfers to the state as provided in subsection 5 of this section; and\n\n(5) For payment of any other costs other than the payment of bonds approved by the authority to implement sections 8.500 to 8.565.\n\n5. Prior to disbursement of the moneys in the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund in accordance with subsection 4 of this section, the authority shall have the power to transfer moneys in the fund to the state general revenue fund for the purposes of funding the program plan on an interim basis, provided the state agrees to reimburse the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund before the date such moneys are expected to be expended by the authority.\n\n6. No more than one hundred seventy-five million dollars of the net proceeds of bonds authorized by sections 8.500 to 8.565 may be applied to the payment of the costs of the program plan during any fiscal year; provided, amounts not so applied during a prior fiscal year may be carried over and applied to costs of implementing the program plan during the next successive fiscal year.\n\n(L. 2002 S.B. 1191)\n\nEffective 6-07-02\n\n*Section terminates upon satisfaction of all outstanding notes and obligations.

Proceeds of bonds to be deposited in the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund, use of moneys — issuance of bonds, requirements. —1. The net proceeds from bonds issued by the authority shall be deposited in the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund and applied to the governmental purposes provided in section 8.550 hereof. The net proceeds from such bonds may be used to implement sections 8.500 to 8.565 and carry out the program plan. In connection with the issuance of bonds and subject to the terms of the sales agreement, the authority shall determine the terms and other details of the financing and the method of implementation of sections 8.500 to 8.565. Bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a pledge of the authority's interest in any sales agreement and any other sources available to the authority with the exception of moneys in the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund. The authority shall also have the power to issue refunding bonds, including advance refunding bonds, for the purpose of refunding previously issued bonds, and shall have the power to issue any other types of bonds, debt obligations, and financing arrangements necessary to fulfill the purposes of sections 8.500 to 8.565, including but not limited to the issuance of debt obligations with a maturity of not more than one year from the date of issue for the purpose of preserving any expenditure of moneys from the state general revenue fund for reimbursement from the proceeds of any bonds to be issued pursuant to sections 8.500 to 8.565. The state may transfer to the authority funds designated in the state's budget for such expenditure for the purpose of securing such debt obligations. Such debt obligations may also be secured by a covenant of the authority to issue bonds under sections 8.500 to 8.565. The purpose for the issuance of such debt obligations and the transfer of such moneys shall be to maximize the utilization of tax-exempt bonds by the authority.\n\n2. The authority may issue its bonds in principal amounts which, in the opinion of the authority, are necessary to provide sufficient funds for achievement of its purposes, the payment of interest on its bonds, the establishment of reserves to secure the bonds, the costs of issuance of its bonds, and all other expenditures of the authority incident to and necessary to carry out its purposes or powers. The bonds are investment securities and negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for the purposes of the uniform commercial code.\n\n3. Bonds issued by the authority are special obligations of the authority payable solely and only out of the moneys, assets, or revenues pledged by the authority and are not a general obligation or indebtedness of the authority or an obligation or indebtedness of the state or any political subdivision of the state. The authority shall not pledge the credit or taxing power of the state or any political subdivision of the state, or create a debt or obligation of the state, or make its debts payable out of any moneys except those of the authority specifically pledged to such purpose, and shall exclude from any such pledge those moneys deposited in the tobacco securitization settlement trust fund.\n\n4. Bonds issued by the authority shall state on their face that they are special obligations payable both as to principal and interest solely out of the assets of the authority pledged for their purpose and do not constitute an indebtedness of the state or any political subdivision of the state; are secured solely by and payable solely from assets of the authority pledged for such purpose; constitute neither a general, legal, or moral obligation of the state or any of its political subdivisions; and that the state has no obligation or intention to satisfy any deficiency or default of any payment of the bonds.\n\n5. Any amount pledged by the authority to be received under the master settlement agreement shall be valid and binding at the time the pledge is made. Amounts so pledged and then or thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind against the authority, whether such parties have notice of the lien. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the resolution of the authority or any other instrument by which a pledge is created need not be recorded or filed to perfect such pledge.\n\n6. The bonds shall comply with all of the following:\n\n(1) The bonds shall be in a form, issued in denominations, executed in a manner, and payable over terms, not to exceed forty-five years, and with rights of redemption, as the board prescribes in the resolution authorizing their issuance;\n\n(2) The bonds shall be fully negotiable instruments under the laws of the state. The sale of bonds issued pursuant to this section may be completed on a negotiated or competitive basis, but in no event shall such bonds be sold for less than ninety-five percent of the par value thereof, plus accrued interest;\n\n(3) The aggregate costs of issuance of any bonds or other obligations issued by the authority (excluding insurance or other credit enhancement) shall not exceed one and one-half percent of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds, if the aggregate principal amount is equal to or greater than three hundred million dollars, or two percent of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds, if the aggregate principal amount is less than three hundred million dollars. The authority shall not procure insurance or other credit enhancement for the bonds unless the underwriter or the authority's financial advisor certifies that the present value of the premium paid for such insurance or credit enhancement is less than the present value of the interest expected to be saved as a result of the insurance or credit enhancement; and\n\n(4) The bonds shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and covenants providing for the payment of the principal, redemption premiums, if any, interest which may be fixed or variable during any period the bonds are outstanding, and other terms, conditions, covenants, and protective provisions safeguarding payment, not inconsistent with sections 8.500 to 8.565 and as determined by resolution of the board authorizing their issuance.\n\n7. All banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment companies, insurance companies and associations, and all executors, administrators, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries legally may invest any sinking funds, moneys or other funds belonging to them or within their control in any bonds issued pursuant to sections 8.500 to 8.565. Interest on the authority's bonds shall be exempt from Missouri taxation in the state of Missouri for all purposes except the state estate tax.\n\n8. Following the approval of the board of public buildings, bonds may be issued by the authority pursuant to the provisions of sections 8.500 to 8.565 pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the board and no other proceedings shall be required therefor. However, a resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds may delegate to an officer of the authority the power to negotiate and fix the details of an issue of bonds by an appropriate certificate of the authorized officer.\n\n9. The state reserves the right at any time to alter, amend, repeal, or otherwise change the structure, organization, programs, or activities of the authority, including the power to terminate the authority, except that a law shall not be enacted that impairs any obligation made pursuant to a sales agreement or any contract entered into by the authority with or on behalf of the holders of the bonds.\n\n(L. 2002 S.B. 1191)\n\nEffective 6-07-02\n\n*Section terminates upon satisfaction of all outstanding notes and obligations.

Unless contrary to any federal funding requirements or unless funds from a state grant are not timely received by the contracting public municipality but notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all public works contracts made and awarded by the appropriate officer, board or agency of the state or of a political subdivision of the state or of any district therein, including any municipality, county and any board referred to as the public owner, for construction, reconstruction or alteration of any public works project, shall provide for prompt payment by the public owner to the contractor, and any professional engineer, architect, landscape architect, or land surveyor, as well as prompt payment by the contractor to the subcontractor and material supplier in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) A public owner shall make progress payments to the contractor and any professional engineer, architect, landscape architect, or land surveyor on at least a monthly basis as the work progresses, or, on a lump sum basis according to the terms of the lump sum contract. Except in the case of lump sum contracts, payments shall be based upon estimates prepared at least monthly of work performed and material delivered, as determined by the project architect or engineer. Retainage withheld on any construction contract or subcontract for public works projects shall not exceed five percent of the value of the contract or subcontract. If the contractor is not required to obtain a bond under section 107.170 because the cost of the public works contract is not estimated to exceed fifty thousand dollars, the public owner may withhold retainage on the public works project in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the value of the contract or subcontract. The public owner shall pay the contractor the amount due, less a retainage, within thirty days following the latter of the following:\n\n(a) The date of delivery of materials or construction services purchased;\n\n(b) The date, as designated by the public owner, upon which the invoice is duly delivered to the person or place designated by the public owner; or\n\n(c) In those instances in which the contractor approves the public owner's estimate, the date upon which such notice of approval is duly delivered to the person or place designated by the public owner;\n\n(2) Payments shall be considered received within the context of this section when they are duly posted with the United States Postal Service or other agreed upon delivery service or when they are hand-delivered to an authorized person or place as agreed to by the contracting parties;\n\n(3) If, in the discretion of the owner and the project architect or engineer and the contractor, it is determined that a subcontractor's performance has been completed and the subcontractor can be released prior to substantial completion of the public works contract without risk to the public owner, the contractor shall request such adjustment in retainage, if any, from the public owner as necessary to enable the contractor to pay the subcontractor in full. The public owner may reduce or eliminate retainage on any contract payment if, in the public owner's opinion, the work is proceeding satisfactorily. If retainage is released and there are any remaining minor items to be completed, an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the value of each item as determined by the public owner's duly authorized representatives shall be withheld until such item or items are completed;\n\n(4) The public owner shall pay at least ninety-eight percent of the retainage, less any offsets or deductions authorized in the contract or otherwise authorized by law, to the contractor. The contractor shall pay the subcontractor or supplier after substantial completion of the contract work and acceptance by the public owner's authorized contract representative, or as may otherwise be provided by the contract specifications for state highway, road or bridge projects administered by the state highways and transportation commission. Such payment shall be made within thirty days after acceptance, and the invoice and all other appropriate documentation and certifications in complete and acceptable form are provided, as may be required by the contract documents. If the public owner or the owner's representative determines the work is not substantially completed and accepted, then the owner or the owner's representative shall provide a written explanation of why the work is not considered substantially completed and accepted within fourteen calendar days to the contractor, who shall then provide such notice to the subcontractor or suppliers responsible for such work. If such written explanation is not given by the public body, the public body shall pay at least ninety-eight percent of the retainage within thirty calendar days. If at that time there are any remaining minor items to be completed, an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the value of each item as determined by the public owner's representative shall be withheld until such items are completed;\n\n(5) All estimates or invoices for supplies and services purchased, approved and processed, or final payments, shall be paid promptly and shall be subject to late payment charges provided in this section. Except as provided in subsection 4 of this section, if the contractor has not been paid within thirty days as set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of this section, the contracting agency shall pay the contractor, in addition to the payment due him, interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month calculated from the expiration of the thirty-day period until fully paid;\n\n(6) When a contractor receives any payment, the contractor shall pay each subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the work completed by each subcontractor and material supplier his application less any retention not to exceed five percent. If the contractor receives less than the full payment due under the public construction contract, the contractor shall be obligated to disburse on a pro rata basis those funds received, with the contractor, subcontractors and material suppliers each receiving a prorated portion based on the amount of payment. When, however, the public owner does not release the full payment due under the contract because there are specific areas of work or materials he is rejecting or because he has otherwise determined such areas are not suitable for payment then those specific subcontractors or suppliers involved shall not be paid for that portion of the work rejected or deemed not suitable for payment; provided the public owner or the owner's representative gives a written explanation to the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier involved as to why the work or supplies were rejected or deemed not suitable for payment, and all other subcontractors and suppliers shall be paid in full;\n\n(7) If the contractor, without reasonable cause, fails to make any payment to his subcontractors and material suppliers within fifteen days after receipt of payment under the public construction contract, the contractor shall pay to his subcontractors and material suppliers, in addition to the payment due them, interest in the amount of one and one-half percent per month, calculated from the expiration of the fifteen-day period until fully paid. This subdivision shall also apply to any payments made by subcontractors and material suppliers to their subcontractors and material suppliers and to all payments made to lower tier subcontractors and material suppliers throughout the contracting chain;\n\n(8) The public owner shall make final payment of all moneys owed to the contractor, including any retainage withheld under subdivision (4) of this subsection, less any offsets or deductions authorized in the contract or otherwise authorized by law, within thirty days of the due date. Final payment shall be considered due upon the earliest of the following events:\n\n(a) Completion of the project and filing with the owner of all required documentation and certifications, in complete and acceptable form, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract;\n\n(b) The project is certified by the architect or engineer authorized to make such certification on behalf of the owner as having been completed, including the filing of all documentation and certifications required by the contract, in complete and acceptable form; or\n\n(c) The project is certified by the contracting authority as having been completed, including the filing of all documentation and certifications required by the contract, in complete and acceptable form.\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall prevent the contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application or certification to the public owner or contractor, from withholding such applications or certifications to the owner or contractor for payment to the subcontractor or material supplier. Amounts intended to be withheld shall not be included in such applications or certifications to the public owner or contractor. Reasons for withholding such applications or certifications shall include, but not be limited to, the following: unsatisfactory job progress; defective construction work or material not remedied; disputed work; failure to comply with other material provisions of the contract; third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed; failure of the subcontractor to make timely payments for labor, equipment and materials; damage to a contractor or another subcontractor or material supplier; reasonable evidence that the contract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract sum or a reasonable amount for retention, not to exceed the initial percentage retained by the owner.\n\n3. Should the contractor determine, after application or certification has been made and after payment has been received from the public owner, or after payment has been received by a contractor based upon the public owner's estimate of materials in place and work performed as provided by contract, that all or a portion of the moneys needs to be withheld from a specific subcontractor or material supplier for any of the reasons enumerated in this section, and such moneys are withheld from such subcontractor or material supplier, then such undistributed amounts shall be specifically identified in writing and deducted from the next application or certification made to the public owner or from the next estimate by the public owner of payment due the contractor, until a resolution of the matter has been achieved. Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the terms of the contract documents. Upon such resolution the amounts withheld by the contractor from the subcontractor or material supplier shall be included in the next application or certification made to the public owner or the next estimate by the public owner and shall be paid promptly in accordance with the provisions of this section. This subsection shall also apply to applications or certifications made by subcontractors or material suppliers to the contractor and throughout the various tiers of the contracting chain.\n\n4. The contracts which provide for payments to the contractor based upon the public owner's estimate of materials in place and work performed rather than applications or certifications submitted by the contractor, the public owner shall pay the contractor within thirty days following the date upon which the estimate is required by contract to be completed by the public owner, the amount due less a retainage not to exceed five percent. All such estimates by the public owner shall be paid promptly and shall be subject to late payment charges as provided in this subsection. After the thirtieth day following the date upon which the estimate is required by contract to be completed by the public owner, the contracting agency shall pay the contractor, in addition to the payment due him, interest at a rate of one and one-half percent per month calculated from the expiration of the thirty-day period until fully paid.\n\n5. The public owner shall pay or cause to be paid to any professional engineer, architect, landscape architect, or land surveyor the amount due within thirty days following the receipt of an invoice prepared and submitted in accordance with the contract terms. In addition to the payment due, the contracting agency shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month calculated from the expiration of the thirty-day period until fully paid.\n\n6. Nothing in this section shall prevent the owner from withholding payment or final payment from the contractor, or a subcontractor or material supplier. Reasons for withholding payment or final payment shall include, but not be limited to, the following: liquidated damages; unsatisfactory job progress; defective construction work or material not remedied; disputed work; failure to comply with any material provision of the contract; third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed; failure to make timely payments for labor, equipment or materials; damage to a contractor, subcontractor or material supplier; reasonable evidence that a subcontractor or material supplier cannot be fully compensated under its contract with the contractor for the unpaid balance of the contract sum; or citation by the enforcing authority for acts of the contractor or subcontractor which do not comply with any material provision of the contract and which result in a violation of any federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance applicable to that project causing additional costs or damages to the owner.\n\n7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require direct payment by a public owner to a subcontractor or supplier, except in the case of the default, as determined by a court, of the contractor on the contract with the public owner where no performance or payment bond is required or where the surety fails to execute its duties, as determined by a court.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section to the contrary, no late payment interest shall be due and owing for payments which are withheld in good faith for reasonable cause pursuant to subsections 2, 5, and 6 of this section. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that a payment which was withheld pursuant to subsections 2, 5, and 6 of this section was not withheld in good faith for reasonable cause, the court may impose interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month calculated from the date of the invoice and may, in its discretion, award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. In any civil action or part of a civil action brought pursuant to this section, if a court determines after a hearing for such purpose that the cause was initiated, or a defense was asserted, or a motion was filed, or any proceeding therein was done frivolously and in bad faith, the court shall require the party who initiated such cause, asserted such defense, filed such motion, or caused such proceeding to be had to pay the other party named in such action the amount of the costs attributable thereto and reasonable expenses incurred by such party, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n(L. 2022 S.B. 758)\n\nTransferred 2022; formerly § 34.057.",
