The determination as to whether or not there is such need for an authority to function may be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by fifty taxpayers of the city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.\n\n2. The governing body shall determine that there is need for a housing authority in the city or county, as the case may be, if it shall find that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such city or county or that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such city or county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.\n\n3. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution or other declaration by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolutions or other declaration shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the city or county, as the case may be. A copy of such resolution or other declaration duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 7856)\n\n(1989) Public housing authorities are statutory municipal corporations and exercise only governmental functions which are subject to governmental immunity.

A redevelopment or urban renewal plan shall be sufficiently complete to indicate its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, improved traffic, public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements and the proposed land uses and building requirements in the land clearance or urban renewal project area, and shall include without being limited to:\n\n(a) The boundaries of the land clearance or urban renewal project area, with a map showing the existing uses and condition of the real property therein;\n\n(b) A land use plan showing proposed uses of the area;\n\n(c) Information showing the standards of population densities, land coverage and building intensities in the area after redevelopment or urban renewal;\n\n(d) A statement of the proposed changes, if any, in zoning ordinances or maps, street layouts, street levels or grades, building codes and ordinances;\n\n(e) A statement as to the kind and number of additional public facilities or utilities which will be required in the area after redevelopment or urban renewal; and\n\n(f) A schedule indicating the estimated length of time needed for completion of each phase of the plan.\n\n(5) Prior to recommending a redevelopment or urban renewal plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall submit the plan to the planning agency, if any, of the community in which the land clearance or urban renewal project area is located for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the community as a whole. The planning agency shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed redevelopment or urban renewal plan to the authority within thirty days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning agency, or, if no recommendations are received within the thirty days, then without the recommendations, an authority may recommend the redevelopment or urban renewal plan to the governing body of the community for approval.\n\n(6) Prior to recommending a redevelopment or urban renewal plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall consider whether the proposed land uses and building requirements in the land clearance or urban renewal project area are designed with the general purpose of accomplishing, in conformance with the general plan, a coordinated, adjusted and harmonious development of the community and its environs which, in accordance with present and future needs, will promote health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development; including, among other things, adequate provision for traffic, vehicular parking, the promotion of safety from fire, panic and other dangers, adequate provision for light and air, the promotion of the healthful and convenient distribution of population, the provision of adequate transportation, water, sewerage, and other public utilities, schools, parks, recreational and community facilities and other public requirements, the promotion of sound design and arrangement, the wise and efficient expenditure of public funds, the prevention of the recurrence of insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations, or insanitary areas, or conditions of blight or deterioration, and the provision of adequate, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations.\n\n(7) The recommendation of a redevelopment or urban renewal plan by an authority to the governing body shall be accompanied by the recommendations, if any, of the planning commission concerning the redevelopment or urban renewal plan; a statement of the proposed method and estimated cost of the acquisition and preparation for redevelopment or urban renewal of the land clearance or urban renewal project area and the estimated proceeds or revenues from its disposal to redevelopers; a statement of the proposed method of financing the project; a statement of a feasible method proposed for the relocation of families to be displaced from the land clearance or urban renewal project area; and a schedule indicating the estimated length of time needed for completion of each phase of the plan.\n\n(8) The governing body of the community shall hold a public hearing on any redevelopment or urban renewal plan or substantial modification thereof recommended by the authority, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the community once each week for two consecutive weeks, the last publication to be at least ten days prior to the date set for hearing. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also generally identify the area to be covered by the plan. All interested parties shall be afforded at the public hearing a reasonable opportunity to express their views respecting the proposed redevelopment or urban renewal plan.\n\n(9) Following the hearing, the governing body may approve a redevelopment or urban renewal plan if it finds that the plan is feasible and in conformity with the general plan for the development of the community as a whole. A redevelopment or urban renewal plan which has not been approved by the governing body when recommended by the authority may be recommended again to it with any modifications deemed advisable.\n\n(10) A redevelopment or urban renewal plan may be modified at any time by the authority, provided that, if modified after the lease or sale of real property in the land clearance or urban renewal project area, the modification must be consented to by the redeveloper of the real property or his successor, or their successors in interest affected by the proposed modification. Where the proposed modification will substantially change the redevelopment or urban renewal plan as previously approved by the governing body, the modification must similarly be approved by the governing body.\n\n2. As an alternative to the procedures prescribed in subdivisions (2) and (5) of subsection 1, an authority may find an area to be a blighted, insanitary or undeveloped area in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation, and simultaneously prepare a plan, or adopt a plan presented to the authority, and the authority may simultaneously recommend its finding of a blighted, insanitary or undeveloped area and the approval of a plan to the governing body of the community, and the governing body may make its finding that the area is blighted, insanitary or undeveloped and approve the plan simultaneously. Simultaneously with such recommendation of a finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and recommendation of a plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall submit the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped area and the plan to the planning agency, if any, of the community in which the project area is located for review and recommendation as to the conformity of the plan to the general plan for the development of the community as a whole. The planning agency shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and the plan to the authority and the local governing body within thirty days after receipt of the findings and the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning agency, or, if no recommendations are received within the thirty days, then without the recommendations, the governing body may simultaneously approve the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped area and approve the plan in the manner prescribed in subdivisions (8) and (9) of subsection 1.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 300 § 6, A.L. 1955 p. 279, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1411 & 1587)\n\n(1961) Where property acquired by and clearance for redevelopment authority of city was conveyed to university controlled by religious denomination pursuant to a plan adopted by the city in slum clearance project, and where the only bid received was from the university, there was no subsidy of religion from public funds in the absence of showing of fraud or arbitrary action.

Such real property shall be sold, leased or transferred at its fair value for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan notwithstanding such value may be less than the cost of acquiring and preparing such property for redevelopment. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, an authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses and purposes required by such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the redeveloper of such property; the objectives of the redevelopment plan for the prevention of the recurrence of blighted, or insanitary areas; and such other matters as the authority shall specify as being appropriate.

Such notice shall identify the area, and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the office of the authority. The authority shall consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial and legal ability of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate with any redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease of any real property in the land clearance project area. The authority may accept such redevelopment contract proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this law, provided that the authority has, not less than thirty days prior thereto, notified the governing body in writing of its intention to accept such redevelopment contract proposal. Thereafter, the authority may execute such redevelopment contract in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section and deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such redevelopment contract.

The commission shall vote and make recommendations to the governing body of the city, town, or village requesting the public hearing on all proposed redevelopment plans, redevelopment projects, and designations of redevelopment areas, and amendments thereto within thirty days following the completion of the public hearing. A recommendation of approval shall only be deemed to occur if a majority of the commissioners voting on such plan, project, designation, or amendment thereto vote for approval. A tied vote shall be considered a recommendation in opposition. If the commission fails to vote within thirty days following the completion of the public hearing referred to in section 99.825 concerning the proposed redevelopment plan, redevelopment project, or designation of redevelopment area, or amendments thereto, such plan, project, designation, or amendment thereto shall be deemed rejected by the commission.\n\n5.

Obligations secured by the special allocation fund set forth in sections 99.845 and 99.850 for the redevelopment area or redevelopment project may be issued by the municipality pursuant to section 99.820 or by the tax increment financing commission to provide for redevelopment costs. Such obligations, when so issued, shall be retired in the manner provided in the ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of such obligations by the receipts of payments in lieu of taxes as specified in section 99.855 and, subject to annual appropriation, other tax revenue as specified in section 99.845. A municipality may, in the ordinance or resolution, pledge all or any part of the funds in and to be deposited in the special allocation fund created pursuant to sections 99.845 and 99.850 to the payment of the redevelopment costs and obligations. Any pledge of funds in the special allocation fund may provide for distribution to the taxing districts of moneys not required for payment of redevelopment costs or obligations and such excess funds shall be deemed to be surplus funds, except that any moneys allocated to the special allocation fund as provided in subsection 4 of section 99.845, and which are not required for payment of redevelopment costs and obligations, shall not be distributed to the taxing districts but shall be returned to the department of economic development for credit to the general revenue fund. In the event a municipality only pledges a portion of the funds in the special allocation fund for the payment of redevelopment costs or obligations, any such funds remaining in the special allocation fund after complying with the requirements of the pledge, including the retention of funds for the payment of future redevelopment costs, if so required, shall also be deemed surplus funds.

Obligations issued pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865 may be sold at public or private sale at such price as shall be determined by the issuing body and shall state that obligations issued pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865 are special obligations payable solely from the special allocation fund or other funds specifically pledged. No referendum approval of the electors shall be required as a condition to the issuance of obligations pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865.\n\n4.

A municipality, either at the time a redevelopment project is approved or, in the event a municipality has undertaken acts establishing a redevelopment plan and redevelopment project and has designated a redevelopment area after the passage and approval of sections 99.800 to 99.865 but prior to August 13, 1982, which acts are in conformance with the procedures of sections 99.800 to 99.865, may adopt tax increment allocation financing by passing an ordinance providing that after the total equalized assessed valuation of the taxable real property in a redevelopment project exceeds the certified total initial equalized assessed valuation of the taxable real property in the redevelopment project, the ad valorem taxes, and payments in lieu of taxes, if any, arising from the levies upon taxable real property in such redevelopment project by taxing districts and tax rates determined in the manner provided in subsection 2 of section 99.855 each year after the effective date of the ordinance until redevelopment costs have been paid shall be divided as follows:\n\n(1) That portion of taxes, penalties and interest levied upon each taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property which is attributable to the initial equalized assessed value of each such taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the area selected for the redevelopment project shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid by the county collector to the respective affected taxing districts in the manner required by law in the absence of the adoption of tax increment allocation financing;\n\n(2) (a) Payments in lieu of taxes attributable to the increase in the current equalized assessed valuation of each taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the area selected for the redevelopment project and any applicable penalty and interest over and above the initial equalized assessed value of each such unit of property in the area selected for the redevelopment project shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid to the municipal treasurer who shall deposit such payment in lieu of taxes into a special fund called the \"Special Allocation Fund\" of the municipality for the purpose of paying redevelopment costs and obligations incurred in the payment thereof. Beginning August 28, 2014, if the voters in a taxing district vote to approve an increase in such taxing district's levy rate for ad valorem tax on real property, any additional revenues generated within an existing redevelopment project area that are directly attributable to the newly voter-approved incremental increase in such taxing district's levy rate shall not be considered payments in lieu of taxes subject to deposit into a special allocation fund without the consent of such taxing district. Revenues will be considered directly attributable to the newly voter-approved incremental increase to the extent that they are generated from the difference between the taxing district's actual levy rate currently imposed and the maximum voter-approved levy rate at the time that the redevelopment project was adopted. Payments in lieu of taxes which are due and owing shall constitute a lien against the real estate of the redevelopment project from which they are derived and shall be collected in the same manner as the real property tax, including the assessment of penalties and interest where applicable. The municipality may, in the ordinance, pledge the funds in the special allocation fund for the payment of such costs and obligations and provide for the collection of payments in lieu of taxes, the lien of which may be foreclosed in the same manner as a special assessment lien as provided in section 88.861. No part of the current equalized assessed valuation of each lot, block, tract, or parcel of property in the area selected for the redevelopment project attributable to any increase above the total initial equalized assessed value of such properties shall be used in calculating the general state school aid formula provided for in section 163.031 until such time as all redevelopment costs have been paid as provided for in this section and section 99.850.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, for purposes of determining the limitation on indebtedness of local government pursuant to Article VI, Section 26(b) of the Missouri Constitution, the current equalized assessed value of the property in an area selected for redevelopment attributable to the increase above the total initial equalized assessed valuation shall be included in the value of taxable tangible property as shown on the last completed assessment for state or county purposes.\n\n(c) The county assessor shall include the current assessed value of all property within the taxing district in the aggregate valuation of assessed property entered upon the assessor's book and verified pursuant to section 137.245, and such value shall be utilized for the purpose of the debt limitation on local government pursuant to Article VI, Section 26(b) of the Missouri Constitution;\n\n(3) For purposes of this section,\"levies upon taxable real property in such redevelopment project by taxing districts\"shall not include the blind pension fund tax levied under the authority of Article III, Section 38(b) of the Missouri Constitution, or the merchants' and manufacturers' inventory replacement tax levied under the authority of subsection 2 of Section 6 of Article X of the Missouri Constitution, except in redevelopment project areas in which tax increment financing has been adopted by ordinance pursuant to a plan approved by vote of the governing body of the municipality taken after August 13, 1982, and before January 1, 1998.\n\n2. In addition to the payments in lieu of taxes described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section, for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or redevelopment projects approved by ordinance after July 12, 1990, and prior to August 31, 1991, fifty percent of the total additional revenue from taxes, penalties and interest imposed by the municipality, or other taxing districts, which are generated by economic activities within the area of the redevelopment project over the amount of such taxes generated by economic activities within the area of the redevelopment project in the calendar year prior to the adoption of the redevelopment project by ordinance, while tax increment financing remains in effect, but excluding taxes imposed on sales or charges for sleeping rooms paid by transient guests of hotels and motels, taxes levied pursuant to section 70.500, licenses, fees or special assessments other than payments in lieu of taxes and any penalty and interest thereon, or, effective January 1, 1998, taxes levied pursuant to section 94.660, for the purpose of public transportation, shall be allocated to, and paid by the local political subdivision collecting officer to the treasurer or other designated financial officer of the municipality, who shall deposit such funds in a separate segregated account within the special allocation fund. Any provision of an agreement, contract or covenant entered into prior to July 12, 1990, between a municipality and any other political subdivision which provides for an appropriation of other municipal revenues to the special allocation fund shall be and remain enforceable.\n\n3. In addition to the payments in lieu of taxes described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section, for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or redevelopment projects approved by ordinance after August 31, 1991, fifty percent of the total additional revenue from taxes, penalties and interest which are imposed by the municipality or other taxing districts, and which are generated by economic activities within the area of the redevelopment project over the amount of such taxes generated by economic activities within the area of the redevelopment project in the calendar year prior to the adoption of the redevelopment project by ordinance, while tax increment financing remains in effect, but excluding personal property taxes, taxes imposed on sales or charges for sleeping rooms paid by transient guests of hotels and motels, taxes levied pursuant to section 70.500, taxes levied for the purpose of public transportation pursuant to section 94.660, taxes imposed on sales pursuant to subsection 2 of section 67.1712 for the purpose of operating and maintaining a metropolitan park and recreation district, licenses, fees or special assessments other than payments in lieu of taxes and penalties and interest thereon, any sales tax imposed by a county with a charter form of government and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer than seven hundred thousand inhabitants, for the purpose of sports stadium improvement or levied by such county under section 238.410 for the purpose of the county transit authority operating transportation facilities, or for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or redevelopment projects approved by ordinance after August 28, 2013, taxes imposed on sales under and pursuant to section 67.700 or 650.399 for the purpose of emergency communication systems, shall be allocated to, and paid by the local political subdivision collecting officer to the treasurer or other designated financial officer of the municipality, who shall deposit such funds in a separate segregated account within the special allocation fund. Beginning August 28, 2014, if the voters in a taxing district vote to approve an increase in such taxing district's sales tax or use tax, other than the renewal of an expiring sales or use tax, any additional revenues generated within an existing redevelopment project area that are directly attributable to the newly voter-approved incremental increase in such taxing district's levy rate shall not be considered economic activity taxes subject to deposit into a special allocation fund without the consent of such taxing district.\n\n4. Beginning January 1, 1998, for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or redevelopment projects approved by ordinance and which have complied with subsections 4 to 12 of this section, in addition to the payments in lieu of taxes and economic activity taxes described in subsections 1, 2 and 3 of this section, up to fifty percent of the new state revenues, as defined in subsection 8 of this section, estimated for the businesses within the project area and identified by the municipality in the application required by subsection 10 of this section, over and above the amount of such taxes reported by businesses within the project area as identified by the municipality in their application prior to the approval of the redevelopment project by ordinance, while tax increment financing remains in effect, may be available for appropriation by the general assembly as provided in subsection 10 of this section to the department of economic development supplemental tax increment financing fund, from the general revenue fund, for distribution to the treasurer or other designated financial officer of the municipality with approved plans or projects.\n\n5. The treasurer or other designated financial officer of the municipality with approved plans or projects shall deposit such funds in a separate segregated account within the special allocation fund established pursuant to section 99.805.\n\n6. No transfer from the general revenue fund to the Missouri supplemental tax increment financing fund shall be made unless an appropriation is made from the general revenue fund for that purpose. No municipality shall commit any state revenues prior to an appropriation being made for that project. For all redevelopment plans or projects adopted or approved after December 23, 1997, appropriations from the new state revenues shall not be distributed from the Missouri supplemental tax increment financing fund into the special allocation fund unless the municipality's redevelopment plan ensures that one hundred percent of payments in lieu of taxes and fifty percent of economic activity taxes generated by the project shall be used for eligible redevelopment project costs while tax increment financing remains in effect. This account shall be separate from the account into which payments in lieu of taxes are deposited, and separate from the account into which economic activity taxes are deposited.\n\n7. In order for the redevelopment plan or project to be eligible to receive the revenue described in subsection 4 of this section, the municipality shall comply with the requirements of subsection 10 of this section prior to the time the project or plan is adopted or approved by ordinance. The director of the department of economic development and the commissioner of the office of administration may waive the requirement that the municipality's application be submitted prior to the redevelopment plan's or project's adoption or the redevelopment plan's or project's approval by ordinance.\n\n8. For purposes of this section,\"new state revenues\"means:\n\n(1) The incremental increase in the general revenue portion of state sales tax revenues received pursuant to section 144.020, excluding sales taxes that are constitutionally dedicated, taxes deposited to the school district trust fund in accordance with section 144.701, sales and use taxes on motor vehicles, trailers, boats and outboard motors and future sales taxes earmarked by law. In no event shall the incremental increase include any amounts attributable to retail sales unless the municipality or authority has proven to the Missouri development finance board and the department of economic development and such entities have made a finding that the sales tax increment attributable to retail sales is from new sources which did not exist in the state during the baseline year. The incremental increase in the general revenue portion of state sales tax revenues for an existing or relocated facility shall be the amount that current state sales tax revenue exceeds the state sales tax revenue in the base year as stated in the redevelopment plan as provided in subsection 10 of this section; or\n\n(2) The state income tax withheld on behalf of new employees by the employer pursuant to section 143.221 at the business located within the project as identified by the municipality.

No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of sections 99.800 to 99.865 shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of chapter 536. All rulemaking authority delegated prior to June 27, 1997, is of no force and effect and repealed; however, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to repeal or affect the validity of any rule filed or adopted prior to June 27, 1997, if such rule complied with the provisions of chapter 536. The provisions of this section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 including the ability to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule or portion of a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the purported grant of rulemaking authority and any rule so proposed and contained in the order of rulemaking shall be invalid and void.\n\n6. The department of economic development shall provide information and technical assistance, as requested by any municipality, on the requirements of sections 99.800 to 99.865. Such information and technical assistance shall be provided in the form of a manual, written in an easy-to-follow manner, and through consultations with departmental staff.\n\n7. The department of revenue shall provide notice of any failure to comply with the reporting requirements provided in subsection 1 of this section to the applicable municipality, specifying any required corrections, by certified mail addressed to the municipality's chief elected officer. If such municipality does not satisfy the reporting requirements for which it previously did not comply, as specified in the notice from the department of revenue, within sixty days of the receipt of the notice, the municipality shall be prohibited from adopting any new tax increment finance plan for a period of five years from the date of the department of revenue's notice. All reports filed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section or in response to a notice from the department of revenue pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed accepted by the department of revenue unless the department of revenue provides the applicable municipality with a written objection thereto, specifying any required corrections, by certified mail addressed to the chief elected officer of the municipality within sixty days of the municipality's submission of such report.\n\n8. Based upon the information provided in the reports required under the provisions of this section, the state auditor shall make available for public inspection on the auditor's website a searchable electronic database of such municipal tax increment finance reports. All information contained within such database shall be maintained for a period of no less than ten years from initial posting.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1411 & 1587 § 11, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1564, A.L. 1991 H.B. 502, A.L. 1997 2d Ex.

The department of revenue will verify the information provided by the municipalities within forty-five days of receiving a request for such verification from a municipality;\n\n(4) An estimate of the state sales tax increment and state income tax increment within the development project area after redevelopment;\n\n(5) An affidavit that is signed by the developer or developers attesting that the provision of subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of section 99.1027 has been met and specifying that the development area would not be reasonably anticipated to be developed without the appropriation of the other net new revenues;\n\n(6) The amounts and types of other net new revenues sought by the applicant to be disbursed from state supplemental rural development fund over the term of the development plan;\n\n(7) The methodologies and underlying assumptions used in determining the estimate of the state sales tax increment and the state income tax increment;\n\n(8) Any other information reasonably requested by the Missouri agricultural and small business development authority.\n\n2. The Missouri agricultural and small business development authority shall make all reasonable efforts to process applications within sixty days of receipt of the application.\n\n3. The Missouri agricultural and small business development authority shall make a determination regarding the application for a disbursement from the state supplemental rural development fund and shall forward such determination to the director of the department of economic development. In no event shall the amount of disbursements from the state supplemental rural development fund approved for a project, in addition to any other state economic development funding or other state incentives, exceed the projected state benefit of the development project, as determined by the department of economic development through a cost-benefit analysis. Any political subdivision located either wholly or partially within the development area shall be permitted to submit information to the department of economic development for consideration in its cost-benefit analysis.

Such amounts shall be recovered from other net new revenues into the state supplemental rural development fund created pursuant to section 99.1048.\n\n8. A development project approved for state supplemental rural development financing may not thereafter elect to receive tax increment financing pursuant to the real property tax increment allocation redevelopment act, sections 99.800 to 99.865, and continue to receive state supplemental rural development financing pursuant to sections 99.1000 to 99.1060.\n\n9. The Missouri agricultural and small business development authority shall promulgate rules and regulations and publish forms to implement the provisions of this section and section 99.1048.\n\n10. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section and section 99.1048 shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028.
