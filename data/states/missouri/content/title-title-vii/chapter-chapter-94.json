The moneys in the special municipal sales tax trust fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the trust fund which was collected in each municipality imposing the sales tax established in sections 94.850 to 94.857, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of the municipality and the public.\n\n2. The special municipal sales tax trust fund shall be distributed in conjunction with the county sales tax levied under sections 66.600 to 66.630 and may be combined by the director of revenue in a single payment. The director of revenue shall distribute to the municipality levying the tax a portion of the taxes based on the location in which the sales were deemed consummated under subsection 12 of section 32.087 in accordance with the formula described in this subsection. Except for distributions relating to recently annexed areas described in subsection 4 of this section, after deducting the distribution to the municipality, the director of revenue shall distribute the remaining funds in the special municipal sales tax fund to the cities, towns and villages and the county in group B as defined in section 66.620 as follows: To the county, ten percent multiplied by the percentage of the population of unincorporated county which has been annexed or incorporated since April 1, 1993, multiplied by the total sales tax revenues, and a percentage of the remaining distributable revenue equal to the percentage ratio that the population of the unincorporated areas of the county bears to the total population of group B; and to each city, town or village in group B located wholly within the taxing county, a percentage of the remaining distributable revenue equal to the percentage ratio that the population of such city, town or village bears to the total population of group B; and to each city, town or village located partly within the taxing county, a percentage of the remaining distributable revenue equal to the percentage ratio that the population of that part of the city, town or village located within the taxing county bears to the total population of group B.\n\n3. For purposes of administering the distribution formula of subsection 2 of this section, the revenues arising each year from sales occurring within the municipality shall be shared as follows: The municipality shall receive that portion of the revenues arising from sales occurring within the municipality that remains after deducting therefrom an amount equal to the cumulative sales tax revenues arising from sales within the municipality multiplied by the sum of ten percent multiplied by the percentage of the population of unincorporated county which has been annexed or incorporated after April 1, 1993, and the greater of 12.5 percent or the percentage equal to the product of 11.627 multiplied by the logarithm (to base 10) of the product of 0.15 multiplied by the total of the cumulative per capita sales taxes arising from sales within the municipality pursuant to sections 94.850 to 94.857 less one-eighth, in the case of a one-eighth of one percent sales tax, or one quarter, in the case of a one-fourth of one percent sales tax, of the per capita countywide average of all sales tax distributions during the prior calendar year under section 66.620, which average is reduced by the percentage which is equal to ten percent multiplied by the percentage of the population of unincorporated county which has been annexed or incorporated after April 1, 1993.\n\n4. Sales taxes arising from sales within recently annexed areas pursuant to sections 94.850 to 94.857 shall be divided half to the municipality and half to the county until the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the annexation, and shall thereafter be distributed as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of this section. A\"recently annexed area\"is any area which was annexed or incorporated from or in the unincorporated area of the county less than five years prior to the effective date of the sales tax under sections 94.850 to 94.857.\n\n5. Not later than the tenth day of each month, the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the special municipal sales tax trust fund during the preceding month as provided in this section.\n\n6. The director of revenue may authorize the state treasurer to make refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to any municipality for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such municipalities. If any city, town or village abolishes the tax, the municipality shall notify the director of revenue of the action at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the repeal and the director of revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such municipality, the director of revenue shall remit the balance in the account to the municipality and close the account. The director of revenue shall notify each county of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the municipality.\n\n(L. 1993 H.B. 618 § 4)",
