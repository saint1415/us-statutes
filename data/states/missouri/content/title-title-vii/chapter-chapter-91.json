As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Municipally owned or operated electric power system\", a system for the distribution of electrical power and energy to the inhabitants of a municipality which is owned and operated by the municipality itself, whether operated under authority pursuant to this chapter or under a charter form of government;\n\n(2)\"Permanent service\", electrical service provided through facilities which have been permanently installed on a structure and which are designed to provide electric service for the structure's anticipated needs for the indefinite future, as contrasted with facilities installed temporarily to provide electrical service during construction. Service provided temporarily shall be at the risk of the electrical supplier and shall not be determinative of the rights of the provider or recipient of permanent service;\n\n(3)\"Structure\"or\"structures\", an agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial or other building or a mechanical installation, machinery or apparatus at which retail electric energy is being delivered through a metering device which is located on or adjacent to the structure and connected to the lines of an electrical corporation, rural electric cooperative, municipally owned or operated electric power system, or joint municipal utility commission. Such terms shall include any contiguous or adjacent additions to or expansions of a particular structure. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer any right on an electric supplier to serve new structures on a particular tract of land because it was serving an existing structure on that tract.\n\n2. Once a municipally owned or operated electrical system, or its predecessor in interest, lawfully commences supplying retail electric energy to a structure through permanent service facilities, it shall have the right to continue serving such structure, and other suppliers of electrical energy shall not have the right to provide service to the structure except as might be otherwise permitted in the context of municipal annexation, pursuant to section 386.800 or pursuant to a territorial agreement approved under section 394.312. The public service commission, upon application made by a customer, may order a change of suppliers on the basis that it is in the public interest for a reason other than a rate differential, and the commission is hereby given jurisdiction over municipally owned or operated electric systems to accomplish the purpose of this section. The commission's jurisdiction under this section is limited to public interest determinations and excludes questions as to the lawfulness of the provision of service, such questions being reserved to courts of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be construed as otherwise conferring upon the commission jurisdiction over the service, rates, financing, accounting or management of any such municipally owned or operated electrical system, and nothing in this section, section 393.106, and section 394.315 shall affect the rights, privileges or duties of any municipality to form or operate municipally owned or operated electrical systems. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make lawful any provision of service which was unlawful prior to July 11, 1991. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make unlawful the continued lawful provision of service to any structure which may have had a different supplier in the past, if such a change in supplier was lawful at the time it occurred.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections*393.106,*394.080, and*394.315 to the contrary, in the event that a retail electric supplier is providing service to a structure located within a city, town, or village that has ceased to be a rural area, and such structure is demolished and replaced by a new structure, such retail electric service supplier may provide permanent service to the new structure upon the request of the owner of the new structure.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 221, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271 merged with H.B. 734 merged with S.B. 44)\n\n*Word \"section\" appears here in original rolls of H.B. 271 and H.B. 734, 2021.\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nElectric vehicle charging station considered an addition or expansion of existing structure, when, 386.805",

Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, any aluminum smelting facility shall have the right to purchase and contract to purchase electric power and energy and delivery services from any provider, wherever found or located, at whatever rates or charges as contracted for, and such periods or times as is needed or necessary or convenient for the operation of such aluminum smelting facility and for no other purpose, notwithstanding any past circumstances of supply. Any aluminum smelting facility purchasing or contracting to purchase electric power and energy pursuant to this section shall not resell such electric power and energy to any party except the original providers of such electric power and energy.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 91.025, section 393.106, and section 394.315 to the contrary, any provider of such electric power and energy and delivery services, whether or not otherwise under Missouri regulatory jurisdiction, shall have the right to transact for and sell electric power and energy and delivery services to an aluminum smelting facility. Any transactions or contracts pursuant to this section for electric power and energy and delivery services shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission with regard to the determination of rates.\n\n4.

No local electric service utility provider of electric power and energy or delivery services shall have any obligation to supply or deliver backup, peaking or emergency power to an aluminum smelting facility exercising its rights under this section, nor liability for inability or failure to provide such power, except as may be established by written contract.\n\n6. Once an aluminum smelting facility has purchased electric power pursuant to its rights pursuant to this section, no past supplier of energy and related services shall have any obligation to provide electric power and energy and delivery services to such aluminum smelting facility except as may be established by written contract.\n\n7. The provisions of this section recognize highly unique circumstances of aluminum smelting facilities and are not to be interpreted as condoning or conceding the suitability of retail electric restructuring for any customer or class of customers in the state of Missouri.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 208 merged with S.B. 555)\n\nEffective 5-22-03 (S.B. 555) 7-09-03 (H.B. 208)",
