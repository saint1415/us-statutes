Upon making the determinations specified in subsection 1 of this section, the board may declare that each owner of an issue of revenue bonds or notes shall be entitled, in lieu of any other deduction with respect to such bonds or notes, to a tax credit against any tax otherwise due by such owner pursuant to the provisions of chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.261, chapter 147, or chapter 148, in the amount of one hundred percent of the unpaid principal of and unpaid interest on such bonds or notes held by such owner in the taxable year of such owner following the calendar year of the default of the loan by the borrower with respect to the project. The occurrence of a default shall be governed by documents authorizing the issuance of the bonds. The tax credit allowed pursuant to this section shall be available to the original owners of the bonds or notes or any subsequent owner or owners thereof. Once an owner is entitled to a claim, any such tax credits shall be transferable as provided in subsection 7 of section 100.286. Notwithstanding any provision of Missouri law to the contrary, any portion of the tax credit to which any owner of a revenue bond or note is entitled pursuant to this section which exceeds the total income tax liability of such owner of a revenue bond or note shall be carried forward and allowed as a credit against any future taxes imposed on such owner within the next ten years pursuant to the provisions of chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.261, chapter 147, or chapter 148. The eligibility of the owner of any revenue bond or note issued pursuant to the provisions of sections 100.250 to 100.297 for the tax credit provided by this section shall be expressly stated on the face of each such bond or note. The tax credit allowed pursuant to this section shall also be available to any financial institution or guarantor which executes any credit facility as security for bonds issued pursuant to this section to the same extent as if such financial institution or guarantor was an owner of the bonds or notes, provided however, in such case the tax credits provided by this section shall be available immediately following any default of the loan by the borrower with respect to the project. In addition to reimbursing the financial institution or guarantor for claims relating to unpaid principal and interest, such claim may include payment of any unpaid fees imposed by such financial institution or guarantor for use of the credit facility.\n\n3. The aggregate principal amount of revenue bonds or notes outstanding at any time with respect to which the tax credit provided in this section shall be available shall not exceed fifty million dollars.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 416, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1248 & 1048, A.L. 1997 2d Ex.

Preparation and approval of plans shall be carried out within the following regulations:\n\n(1) An authority shall not acquire real property for a project unless the governing body of the city has approved the plan, as prescribed in subdivision (9) of this section.\n\n(2) An authority shall not prepare a plan for a project area unless the governing body of the city has declared, by resolution or ordinance, the area to be blighted, insanitary or undeveloped industrial area in need of industrial development.\n\n(3) An authority shall not recommend a plan to the governing body of the city until a general plan for the development of the city has been prepared.\n\n(4) The authority itself may prepare or cause to be prepared a plan or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to an authority. A plan shall be sufficiently complete to indicate its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, improved traffic, foster employment, public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements and the proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area, and shall include without being limited to:\n\n(a) The boundaries of the project area, with a map showing the existing uses and condition of the real property therein;\n\n(b) A land use plan showing proposed uses of the area;\n\n(c) Information showing the standards of population densities, unemployment within area and adjacent areas, land coverage and building intensities in the area after completion of the plan;\n\n(d) A statement of the proposed changes, if any, in zoning ordinances or maps, street layouts, street levels or grades, building codes and ordinances;\n\n(e) A statement as to the kind and number of additional public facilities or utilities which will be required in the area after completion of the plan;\n\n(f) A schedule indicating the estimated length of time needed for completion of each phase of the plan.\n\n(5) Prior to recommending a plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall submit the plan to the planning agency, if any, of the community in which the project area is located for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the city as a whole. The planning agency shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed plan to the authority within thirty days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning agency, or, if no recommendations are received within the thirty days, then without the recommendations, an authority may recommend the plan to the governing body of the city for approval.\n\n(6) Prior to recommending a plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall consider whether the proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area are designed with the general purpose of accomplishing, in conformance with the general plan, a coordinated, adjusted and harmonious development of the city and its environs which, in accordance with present and future needs, will promote health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development; including, among other things, adequate provision for traffic, vehicular parking, the promotion of safety from fire, panic and other dangers, adequate provision for light and air, the promotion of the healthful and convenient distribution of population, employment opportunities, the provision of adequate transportation, water, sewerage and other public utilities, schools, parks, recreational and community facilities and other public requirements, the promotion of sound design and arrangement, the wise and efficient expenditure of public funds, the prevention of the recurrence of insanitary areas, conditions of blight or deterioration or undeveloped industrial or commercial use.\n\n(7) The recommendation of a plan by an authority to the governing body shall be accompanied by the recommendations, if any, of the planning commission concerning the plan; a statement of the proposed method and estimated cost of the acquisition and preparation for the project area and the estimated proceeds or revenues from its disposal to industrial developers; a statement of the proposed method of financing the project; a statement of a feasible method proposed for the relocation of families to be displaced from the project area; and a schedule indicating the estimated length of time needed for completion of each phase of the plan.\n\n(8) The governing body of the community may hold a public hearing on any plan or substantial modification thereof recommended by the authority, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the community once each week for two consecutive weeks, the last publication to be at least ten days prior to the date set for hearing. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also generally identify the area to be covered by the plan. All interested parties shall be afforded at the public hearing a reasonable opportunity to express their views respecting the proposed plan.\n\n(9) Following the hearing, the governing body may approve a plan if it finds that the plan is feasible and in conformity with the general plan for the development of the community as a whole. A plan which has not been approved by the governing body when recommended by the authority may be recommended again to it with any modifications deemed advisable.\n\n(10) A plan may be modified at any time by the authority, or by the governing body; provided that, if modified after the lease or sale of real property in the project area, the modification must be consented to by the industrial developer of the real property or his successor, or their successors in interest affected by the proposed modification. Where the proposed modification will substantially change the plan as previously approved by the governing body, the modification must similarly be approved by the governing body.\n\n2. As an alternative to the procedures prescribed in subdivisions (2) and (5) of subsection 1, an authority may find an area to be a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and in need of industrial or commercial development and may simultaneously prepare a plan and recommend to the governing body of the community the approval of such finding of*a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and the approval of a plan, whether prepared by the authority or submitted to the authority, and the governing body may make its finding and approve the plan simultaneously. Simultaneously with such recommendation of a finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and recommendation of a plan to the governing body for approval, an authority shall submit the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped area and the plan to the planning agency, if any, of the community in which the project area is located for review and recommendation as to the conformity of the plan to the general plan for the development of the community as a whole. The planning agency shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and the plan to the authority and the local governing body within thirty days after receipt of the findings and the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning agency, or, if no recommendations are received within the thirty days, then without the recommendations, the governing body may approve the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped industrial area and may approve the plan in the manner prescribed in subdivisions (8) and (9) of subsection 1.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 172 § 11, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1477, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1411 & 1587)\n\n*Word \"or\" appears in original rolls.",

Such real property shall be sold, leased or transferred at its fair value for uses in accordance with the plan notwithstanding such value may be less than the cost of such property to the authority. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the plan, an authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses and purposes required by such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by, the developer of such property; the objectives of the plan for the prevention of the recurrence of blighted, insanitary or undeveloped industrial areas; and such other matters as the authority shall specify as being appropriate.

Such notice shall identify the area and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the office of the authority. The authority shall consider all proposals and the financial and legal ability of the prospective developers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate with any industrial developer for proposals for the purchase or lease of any real property in the industrial clearance project area. The authority may accept such industrial development contract proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this law; provided that the authority has, not less than thirty days prior thereto, notified the governing body in writing of its intention to accept such industrial development contract proposal. Thereafter, the authority may execute such industrial development contract in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section and deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such industrial development contract. In its discretion, the authority may, with regard to the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, dispose of real property in a project area to private developers for redevelopment under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures as it shall prescribe, subject to the provisions of subdivision (1).\n\n(3) In carrying out a project, an authority may:\n\n(a) Convey to the city such real property as, in accordance with the development plan, is to be laid out into streets, alleys and public ways, this power being additional to and not limiting any and all other powers of conveyance of property to cities expressed herein generally or otherwise;\n\n(b) Grant servitudes, easements and rights-of-way for public utilities, sewers, streets and other similar facilities, in accordance with the plan; and\n\n(c) Convey to the municipality, county or other appropriate public body such real property as, in accordance with the plan, is to be used for parks, schools, public buildings, facilities or other public purposes.\n\n(4) An authority may temporarily operate and maintain real property in a project area pending the disposition of the property for industrial development, without regard to the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) above, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the plan.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 172 § 12, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1477)",
