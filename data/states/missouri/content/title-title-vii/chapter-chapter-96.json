If two-thirds of the voters voting on the question shall vote for such tax, the tax shall be levied and collected in like manner as other general taxes of the city and shall be a separate fund established for the facility.\n\n4. The tax shall cease in case the voters in the city shall so determine by a majority vote at any election held on such question.
