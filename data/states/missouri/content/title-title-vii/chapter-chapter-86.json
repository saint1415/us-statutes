The board of trustees may develop and establish a deferred retirement option plan (DROP) in which members who are eligible for retirement but who have not terminated employment as police officers and who have not actually retired may participate. The DROP shall be designed to allow members with at least twenty years of creditable service or who have attained the age of fifty-five who have achieved eligibility for retirement and are entitled to a service retirement allowance and other benefits to postpone actual retirement, continue active employment and accumulate a deferred receipt of the service retirement allowance. No one shall participate in the DROP for a period exceeding five years.\n\n2. Any member who has at least twenty years of creditable service or has attained the age of fifty-five may elect in writing before retirement to participate in the DROP. A member electing to participate in the DROP shall postpone actual retirement, shall continue in active employment and shall not receive any direct retirement allowance payments or benefits during the period of participation.\n\n3. Upon the start of the participation in the DROP, the member shall cease to make any mandatory contributions to the system. No contribution shall be required by the city into the DROP account. During the period of participation in the DROP, the amount that the member would have received as a service retirement allowance if the member had actually retired instead of entering DROP shall be deposited monthly in the member's DROP account which shall be established in the member's name by the board of trustees. The member's service retirement allowance shall not be adjusted for any cost-of-living increases for any period prior to the member's termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement. Cost-of-living increases, if any, for any period following the member's termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement shall be applied only to monthly service retirement payments made following termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement. Service earned during the period of participation in the DROP shall not be creditable service and shall not be counted in determination of any service retirement allowance or surviving spouse's or dependents' benefits. Compensation paid during the period of participation in the DROP shall not be earnable compensation and shall not be counted in the determination of any service retirement allowance or surviving spouse's or dependent's benefits. The member's service retirement allowance shall be frozen as of the date the member enters DROP. Except as specifically provided in sections 86.200 to 86.366, the member's frozen service retirement allowance shall not increase while the member is participating in DROP or after the member's participation in DROP ends, and the member shall not share in any benefit improvement that is enacted or that becomes effective while such member is participating in the DROP.\n\n4. A member shall cease participation in the DROP upon the termination of the member's employment as a police officer and actual retirement, or at the end of the five-year period commencing on the first day of the member's participation in the DROP, or as of the effective date of the member's election to return to active participation in the system, whichever occurs first. A member's election to return to active participation in the system before the end of the five-year period commencing on the first day of participation in the DROP shall be made and shall become effective in accordance with procedures established by the board of trustees. Upon the member's termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement, the member shall elect to receive the value of the member's DROP account, in one of the following forms of payment:\n\n(1) A lump sum payment; or\n\n(2) Equal monthly installments over a ten-year period.­­Either form of payment should begin within thirty days after the member's notice to the board of trustees that the member has selected a particular option.\n\n­­Either form of payment should begin within thirty days after the member's notice to the board of trustees that the member has selected a particular option.\n\n5.

The board of trustees shall notify the chief of police to begin deducting mandatory contributions from the member's salary and the member's employment period shall count as creditable service beginning as of the day the member returns to active participation.\n\n6. In no event shall a member whose participation in DROP has ended for any reason be eligible to participate in DROP again.\n\n7. Upon the member's termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement, the member's mandatory contributions to the retirement system shall be paid to the member pursuant to subsection 4 of section 86.253.\n\n8. If a member dies prior to termination of employment as a police officer and actual retirement while participating in the DROP or before the member has received full withdrawal of the amount in the member's DROP account under the installment optional payment form, the remaining balance of the member's DROP account shall be payable to the member's surviving spouse; or, if the member is then unmarried, to the member's dependent children in equal shares; or, if none, to the member's dependent mother or father; or, if none, to the member's designated beneficiary or, if no such beneficiary is then living, to the member's estate. Payment shall be made in a lump sum within sixty days after receipt by the board of trustees of evidence and proof of the death of a member. In addition, the member's mandatory contributions, if any, that were not already paid to the member pursuant to subsection 4 of section 86.253 shall be paid to the member's surviving spouse pursuant to section 86.288.\n\n9. If a member applies for and receives benefits for an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to the provisions of section 86.263, the member shall forfeit all rights, claims or interest in the member's DROP account and the member's benefits shall be calculated as if the member has continued in employment and had not elected to participate in the DROP. Any portion of a DROP account that has been forfeited as provided in this subsection shall be a general asset of the system.\n\n10. A member's DROP account shall earn interest equal to the rate of return earned by the system's investment portfolio on a market value basis, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of investment expense, as certified by the system's actuary. As of the last day of each plan year beginning after DROP participation begins, the member's DROP account balance, determined as of the last day of the prior plan year, shall be credited with interest at the investment rate earned by the assets of the retirement system for such prior plan year. If distribution of the member's DROP account balance is made in a lump sum under subsection 4 or 8 of this section, interest for the plan year of distribution shall be credited on the ending balance for the prior plan year at the investment rate earned on the assets of the retirement system for the prior plan year, in proportion to the part of the plan year preceding the date of the member's termination of employment or death, whichever is earlier. If the member's DROP account is paid in equal monthly installments pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, interest during the installment period shall be credited as of the last day of each plan year ending after installment payment begins on the account balance as of the first or last day of the plan year, whichever is lower, at the investment rate earned by the assets of the system for the prior plan year. Interest for the year in which the final installment is paid shall be credited on the balance remaining after the final installment is paid, at the investment rate earned on the assets of the system for the prior plan year, in proportion to the part of the plan year preceding payment of the final installment. Any interest credited to the DROP account during the installment period shall be paid as soon as reasonably possible after the final monthly installment. No interest shall be credited on amounts, if any, added to the member's DROP account during the year in which the distribution of the account is completed.\n\n11. The board of trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of other individuals for any act or omission made in good faith in relation to the DROP or assets credited to DROP accounts established by this section. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder shall supersede any provision of this section if there is any inconsistency with the Internal Revenue Code or regulation.\n\n12. Upon the receipt by the board of trustees of evidence and proof that the death of a member resulted from an event occurring while the member was in the actual performance of duty, and if the member is participating in the DROP, the member's surviving spouse or, if the member is then unmarried, the member's unmarried dependent children, may elect within thirty days after the member's death to have the amount in the member's DROP account paid in the form of a monthly survivor annuity. Payment of the survivor annuity shall begin within sixty days after the election is received. Payment to the member's surviving spouse shall continue until the surviving spouse's death; payment to the member's unmarried dependent children shall be made while any child qualifies as an unmarried dependent child pursuant to section 86.280. The survivor annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member's DROP account as of the date of the member's death.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the service retirement allowance of a member who does not earn any creditable service after August 11, 1999, shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy percent of the member's average final compensation, and the service retirement allowance of a member who earns creditable service on or after August 12, 1999, shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy-five percent of the member's average final compensation; provided, however, that the service retirement allowance of a member who is participating in the DROP pursuant to section 86.251 on August 12, 1999, who returns to active participation in the system pursuant to section 86.251, and who terminates employment as a police officer and actually retires for reasons other than death or disability before earning at least two years of creditable service after such return shall be the sum of (1) the member's service retirement allowance as of the date the member entered DROP and (2) an additional service retirement allowance based solely on the creditable service earned by the member following the member's return to active participation.

A college or university shall be deemed to be regularly accredited which maintains membership in good standing in a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by any state college or university;\n\n(8) In the event a surviving spouse receiving death benefits as a result of a prior marriage to a deceased member subsequently remarries another member who also predeceases the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse shall receive a single death benefit pension, which, upon application to the board of trustees, shall be computed under subdivision (1) of this section using the highest of the average final compensations of the deceased members to which the surviving spouse was previously married;\n\n(9) Beginning on August 28, 2023, any surviving spouse that had, prior to August 28, 2023, become ineligible for benefits under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section as a result of remarrying shall, upon application to the board of trustees, have reinstated all future benefits under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section.

Upon the death of a Tier II member who has been retired and receiving a pension, the surviving spouse of such member entitled to receive a base pension under section 86.1240 or children of such member entitled to receive a base pension under subsection 2 of section 86.1250 shall receive an immediate percentage cost-of-living adjustment to their respective base pension equal to the total percentage cost-of-living adjustments received during such member's lifetime under this section, except that the adjustment provided by this subsection shall not apply for any surviving spouse, or for a child or children entitled to benefits which would be received by a qualified surviving spouse, receiving a benefit pursuant to an election made under subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of section 86.1151.\n\n6. For purposes of this section, the term\"base pension\"shall mean:\n\n(1) For a member, the pension computed under the provisions of the law as of the date of retirement without regard to cost-of-living adjustments, as adjusted, if applicable, for any election made under subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of section 86.1151 or section 86.1210, but in all events not including any supplemental benefit under section 86.1230 or section 86.1231;\n\n(2) For a surviving spouse, the base pension calculated for such spouse in accordance with the provisions of section 86.1240 or subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 86.1151, including any compensation as a consultant to which such surviving spouse is entitled under said section in lieu of a pension thereunder, but not including any supplemental benefit under section 86.1230 or section 86.1231; and\n\n(3) For a member's surviving child who is entitled to receive part or all of the pension which would be received by the surviving spouse, if living, the base pension calculated for such surviving spouse in accordance with the provisions of section 86.1240 or subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 86.1151, including any compensation as a consultant to which such spouse would be entitled under said section, if living, divided by the number of surviving children entitled to share in such pension under subsection 2 of section 86.1250.\n\n7. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be an increase or decrease computed on the base pension amount by the retirement board in an amount that the board, in its discretion, determines to be satisfactory, but in no event shall the adjustment be more than three percent or reduce the pension to an amount less than the base pension. In determining and granting the cost-of-living adjustments, the retirement board shall adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, including provisions for the manner of computation of such adjustments and the effective dates thereof. The retirement board shall provide for such adjustments to be determined once each year and granted on a date or dates to be chosen by the board, and may apply such adjustments in full to eligible members as provided in subsections 1 and 2 of this section who have retired during the year prior to such adjustments but who have not been retired for one full year and to the surviving spouse or applicable children of a member who has died during the year prior to such adjustments.\n\n8. The determination of whether the retirement system will remain actuarially sound shall be made at the time any cost-of-living adjustment is granted. If at any time the retirement system ceases to be actuarially sound, pension payments shall continue as adjusted by increases theretofore granted. A member of the retirement board shall have no personal liability for granting increases under this section if that retirement board member in good faith relied and acted upon advice of a qualified actuary that the retirement system would remain actuarially sound.\n\n9. If any benefit under subsection 1 of section 86.1250 on August 27, 2005, would be reduced by application of this section, such benefit shall continue thereafter without reduction, but any benefit so continued shall terminate at the time prescribed in subsection 1 of section 86.1250.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 323, A.L. 2013 H.B. 116 merged with H.B. 418, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1301)",

If the amount of any benefit is to be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions that are not otherwise specifically set forth for that purpose in sections 86.900 to 86.1280, the actuarial assumptions to be used are those earnings and mortality assumptions being used on the date of the determination by the retirement system's actuary and approved by the retirement board. The actuarial assumptions being used at any particular time shall be attached as an addendum to a copy of the retirement system's statute that is maintained by the retirement board and shall be treated for all purposes as a part of sections 86.900 to 86.1280. The actuarial assumptions may be changed by the retirement system's actuary annually if approved by the retirement board, but a change in actuarial assumptions shall not result in any decrease in benefits accrued as of the effective date of the change.\n\n9. Any member or beneficiary who is entitled to receive any distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution, as defined by Section 402(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, is entitled to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan of the member's or beneficiary's choice upon providing direction to the secretary of this retirement system regarding the transfer in accordance with procedures established by the retirement board. Effective for distributions made on or after January 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to directly roll over an eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement account under Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; to an individual retirement annuity under Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; or if the participant satisfies the requirements for making a Roth contribution under Section 408(A)(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to a Roth individual retirement account.\n\n10. For all distributions made after December 31, 2001:\n\n(1) For the purposes of subsection 9 of this section, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by the state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from the retirement system. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code; and\n\n(2) For purposes of subsection 9 of this section, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includable.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 323, A.L. 2013 H.B. 116 merged with H.B. 418, A.L. 2015 H.B. 515)",

If no benefits are otherwise payable to a surviving spouse of a deceased member or otherwise as provided in this section, the member's accumulated contributions, to any extent not fully paid to such member prior to the member's death or to the surviving spouse of such member or otherwise as provided in this section, shall be paid in one lump sum to the member's beneficiary named by such member in a writing filed with the retirement system prior to the member's death for the purpose of receiving such benefit, and if no beneficiary is named, then to such member's estate. Such payment shall constitute full and final payment of any and all claims for benefits under the retirement system, except as provided in section 86.1620.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 323, A.L. 2011 H.B. 183 merged with H.B. 282, A.L. 2013 H.B. 116 merged with H.B. 418)",

If the insurance coverage described in subsection 1 of this section is insufficient or is not in effect, the retirement board may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a member of the retirement board, or is or was serving at the request of the retirement board in the capacity which caused the person's relationship to such action, suit, or proceeding, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and without willful malfeasance, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe the relevant conduct was lawful.

A member's benefit shall be one hundred percent vested and nonforfeitable upon the member's attainment of normal retirement age, which shall be the earlier of:\n\n(1) The attaining of the age of sixty-five or the member's tenth anniversary of employment, whichever is later for any Tier I member, or the attaining of the age of sixty-seven or the member's twentieth anniversary of employment, whichever is later for any Tier II member;\n\n(2) For any Tier I member when the total sum of age and years of creditable service equals or exceeds eighty, or for any Tier II member when the total sum of age and years of creditable service equals or exceeds eighty-five; or\n\n(3) To the extent funded, upon the termination of the system established under sections 86.1310 to 86.1640 or any partial termination which affects the member or any complete discontinuance of contributions by the city to the system.­­Amounts representing forfeited nonvested benefits of terminated members shall not be used to increase benefits payable from the system but may be used to reduce contributions for future plan years.\n\n­­Amounts representing forfeited nonvested benefits of terminated members shall not be used to increase benefits payable from the system but may be used to reduce contributions for future plan years.\n\n5. Distribution of benefits shall begin not later than April first of the year following the later of the calendar year during which the member becomes seventy and one-half years of age or the calendar year in which the member retires, and shall otherwise conform to Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n6. A member or beneficiary of a member shall not accrue a service retirement annuity, disability retirement annuity, death benefit, whether death occurs in the line of duty or otherwise, or any other benefit under sections 86.1310 to 86.1640 in excess of the benefit limits applicable to the fund under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The retirement board shall reduce the amount of any benefit that exceeds the limits of this section by the amount of the excess. If the total benefits under the retirement system and the benefits and contributions to which any member is entitled under any other qualified plan or plans maintained by the board of police commissioners that employs the member would otherwise exceed the applicable limits under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits the member would otherwise receive from the retirement system are reduced to the extent necessary to enable the benefits to comply with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n7. The total salary taken into account for any purpose for any member of the retirement system shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars per year, subject to periodic adjustments in accordance with guidelines provided by the United States Secretary of the Treasury and may not exceed such other limits as may be applicable at any given time under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n8. If the amount of any benefit is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions that are not specifically set forth for that purpose in sections 86.1310 to 86.1640, the actuarial assumptions to be used are those earnings and mortality assumptions used on the date of the determination by the retirement system's actuary and approved by the retirement board. The actuarial assumptions used at any particular time shall be attached as an addendum to a copy of the retirement system's statute maintained by the retirement board and shall be treated for all purposes as part of sections 86.1310 to 86.1640. The actuarial assumptions may be changed by the retirement system's actuary annually if approved by the retirement board, but a change in actuarial assumptions shall not result in any decrease in benefits accrued as of the effective date of the change.\n\n9. Any member or beneficiary who is entitled to receive any distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution, as defined by Section 402(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, is entitled to have that distribution transferred directly to another eligible retirement plan of the member's or beneficiary's choice upon providing direction to the secretary of the retirement system regarding the transfer in accordance with procedures established by the retirement board. Effective for distributions made on or after January 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to directly roll over an eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement account under Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; to an individual retirement annuity under Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; or if the participant satisfies the requirements for making a Roth contribution under Section 408(A)(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to a Roth individual retirement account.\n\n10. For all distributions made after December 31, 2001:\n\n(1) For the purposes of subsection 9 of this section, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from the retirement system. The definition for eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code; and\n\n(2) For the purposes of subsection 9 of this section, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includable.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 323, A.L. 2013 H.B. 116 merged with H.B. 418, A.L. 2015 H.B. 515)",
