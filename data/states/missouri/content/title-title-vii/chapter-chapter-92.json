List of municipalities with business license tax ordinances to be published — revenue director to collect tax, when — basis for tax — rulemaking authority — intent of general assembly — review of revenue collected — audit authority. —1. On or before January 1, 2006, the director shall publish a list of the municipalities which have, prior to August 28, 2005, enacted ordinances imposing a business license tax on a telecommunications company. The list shall contain:\n\n(1) The name of the municipality imposing the tax;\n\n(2) The name of the tax as denoted by the municipality;\n\n(3) The citation to the municipal code provisions imposing the tax; and\n\n(4) The percentage of gross receipts.­­The director shall not be required to include any figures for the percentage of gross receipts if the municipality in question at the time of August 28, 2005, had an ordinance which imposed a flat fee instead of a fee based on gross receipts as its business license tax. In compiling the list, the director shall collect information from telecommunications companies, municipalities, municipal codes, and other reliable sources.\n\n­­The director shall not be required to include any figures for the percentage of gross receipts if the municipality in question at the time of August 28, 2005, had an ordinance which imposed a flat fee instead of a fee based on gross receipts as its business license tax. In compiling the list, the director shall collect information from telecommunications companies, municipalities, municipal codes, and other reliable sources.\n\n2. (1) On or before February 1, 2006, all telecommunications companies in Missouri shall provide the director and the state auditor with the amount of municipal business license tax which they paid each Missouri municipality identified by the director in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for the previous four quarters. On or before February 1, 2006, all telecommunications companies in Missouri shall provide the director and the state auditor with an itemized list establishing their gross receipts for the previous four quarters for each category of gross receipts in each municipality identified by the director in accordance with subsection 1 of this section upon which a sales tax is paid.\n\n(2) On or before February 1, 2006, each municipality shall provide the director and state auditor with the total amount of tax revenue collected for the previous fiscal year of taxable gross receipts from telecommunications companies. Any inconsistency or dispute arising from the information provided by the municipalities and telecommunications companies shall be resolved through an audit performed by the state auditor.\n\n3. Beginning on July 1, 2006, the director shall henceforth collect, administer, and distribute telecommunications business license tax revenues in accordance with the provisions of sections 92.074 to 92.095.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of any municipal business license tax ordinance, effective July 1, 2006, all business license taxes shall be based solely and exclusively on those gross receipts of telecommunications companies for the retail sale of telecommunications services which are subject to taxation under sections 144.010 and 144.020. Any provisions in any municipal taxing ordinances which provide different definitions, rules, or provisions are expressly preempted and are null and void.\n\n5. The director is authorized to promulgate regulations to establish the appropriate procedures for collecting, administering, and distributing such taxes. A telecommunications company shall file a quarterly return with the director with an attached schedule setting forth the total amount of taxable gross receipts for the quarter and the amount of business license tax due to each municipality. The director shall distribute the appropriate amounts, as set forth in this section, to the municipalities. In exchange for its collection, administration, and distribution functions, the department of revenue shall retain a collection fee of up to one percent (not to exceed the actual costs incurred) on all funds collected and distributed and shall be allowed to collect the interest off such funds during the time between collection and distribution. In no event shall the director fail to distribute the collected funds to a municipality more than thirty days after the collection of the funds.\n\n6. It is the intent of the general assembly that sections 92.074 to 92.095 comply with Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, so that the application of sections 92.074 to 92.095 shall have a revenue-neutral effect. Because business license taxes shall now be based on the gross receipts subject to the sales tax, it is anticipated that the base of the existing business license taxes in most cases shall be broadened, so in order to comply with Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, the municipality shall adjust the gross receipts percentage rate identified by the director in accordance with subsection 2 of this section so that the amount collectible, in total from all telecommunications companies, excluding the collection fee authorized in subsection 5 as defined herein, before and immediately after enactment remains the same in each municipality. If the determination is made by a municipality that in order to comply with Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution the gross receipts percentage rate must be increased, such increase shall be passed by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in that municipality. The existing tax base shall be an amount equal to the total amount of telecommunications business license taxes collected by a municipality for fiscal year 2005, increased by fifty percent of the difference between such amount and the business license tax receipts that would have been yielded by applying the gross receipts percentage rate identified in accordance with subsection 1 of this section to the total gross receipts for all wireless telecommunications services provided by telecommunications companies as identified in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(D)(1) and 47 C.F.R. Parts 22 or 24 in such fiscal year attributable to the municipality. Based upon the rate information received from the director under this section, each municipality shall, no later than April 1, 2006, promulgate and publish the revenue-neutral rates to be applied in each municipality. Such tax rates shall be the applicable business license tax rate for bills rendered on or after July 1, 2006. Any percentages in any ordinance that are contrary to that established by the municipality herein are null and void. If any municipal business license tax ordinance as of January 1, 2005, had a provision stating that the tax only applied to business customers, the new calculated rate under this section also shall be determined based only on business customers and shall apply only to business customers.\n\n7. On or before April 1, 2007, the director, in consultation with the state auditor and municipalities, shall examine revenues collected and forecast whether a shortfall or excess in municipal revenues for each municipality is likely to occur for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, due to data reporting errors or other errors in the calculation of the revenue-neutral tax rate. Section 32.057 shall not restrict the disclosure of information to perform such consultation. If a shortfall or excess is expected, the director, after review and comment from municipalities and telecommunications companies, shall promulgate and publish an adjustment in the rate in such municipalities. Such tax rate adjustment, if necessary, shall apply to bills issued after July 1, 2007.\n\n8. The director shall be notified in writing within thirty days of any change in the municipal business license tax rate adopted by a municipality. The director shall promulgate such rate changes, but such rate changes may only take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter and only after a minimum of ninety days notice from the director to a telecommunications company. Any subsequent increase in the business license tax rate passed through an ordinance by a municipality which is above that rate as established by the municipality under subsection 6 of this section shall be passed by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in that municipality. No municipal tax rate shall exceed the cap provided in subsection 9 of this section.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 3 to 8 of this section or any other provision of law to the contrary, for any municipality not subject to the provisions of subsection 10 of this section, the maximum rate of taxation on gross receipts shall not exceed five percent for bills rendered on or after July 1, 2006, except if the business license tax rate for any municipality, as calculated in subsection 6 of this section, or if necessary, subsection 7 of this section, is determined to be greater than five percent, then, notwithstanding the provisions of such subsections, the business license tax rates for such municipality on and after July 1, 2006, shall be as follows:\n\n(1) For bills rendered between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2008, the rate shall be the actual adjusted rate as determined by subsection 6 of*this section, or, if necessary, subsection 7 of this section;\n\n(2) For bills rendered between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2010, the rate shall be half the sum of the rate determined in subdivision (1) of this subsection and five percent; and\n\n(3) For all bills rendered on and after July 1, 2010, five percent.\n\n10. (1) Any municipality which prior to November 4, 1980, had an ordinance imposing a business license tax on telecommunications companies which specifically included the words \"wireless\", \"cell phones\", or \"mobile phones\" in its business license tax ordinance as revenues upon which a business license tax could be imposed, and had not limited its tax to local exchange telephone service or landlines, and had taken affirmative action to collect such tax from wireless telecommunications providers prior to January 15, 2005, shall not be required to adjust its business license tax rate as provided in subsection 6 of this section and shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section.\n\n(2) Any municipality which has an ordinance or an amendment to an ordinance imposing a business license tax on telecommunications companies which was authorized or amended by a public vote subsequent to November 4, 1980, and such authorization specifically included the terms \"wireless\", \"cell phones\", or \"mobile telephones\" as revenues upon which a business license tax could be imposed, and had not limited its tax to local exchange telephone service or landlines, and had taken affirmative action to collect such tax from wireless telecommunications providers prior to January 15, 2005, shall not be required to adjust its business license tax rate as provided in subsection 6 of this section and shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section.\n\n11. For purposes of sections 92.074 to 92.095, the director and any municipality shall have the authority to audit any telecommunications company. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, the director of revenue shall furnish any municipality with information it requests to permit the municipality to review and audit the payments of any telecommunications company.\n\n12. The statute of limitations shall be three years for the alleged nonpayment or underpayment of the business license tax.\n\n13. Any telecommunications company is authorized to pass through to its retail customers all or part of the business license tax.\n\n14. The provisions of subsection 5 of section 144.190 and subdivision (3) of subsection 12 of section 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed under sections 92.074 to 92.095.\n\n15. Unless specifically stated otherwise in sections 92.074 to 92.095, taxpayer remedies, enforcement mechanisms, tax refunds, tax protests, assessments, and all other procedures shall be the same as those provided in chapter 144.\n\n16. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2005, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 209)\n\n*Word \"or\" appears in original rolls.\n\n(2006) Subsection 10 of section 92.086 is a special law prohibited under subdivision (30), Section 40, Article III, Constitution of Missouri.

The tax authorized in this section shall be in addition to all other sales taxes imposed by law, and shall be stated separately from all other charges and taxes. The order or ordinance shall not become effective unless the governing body of the city submits to the voters residing within the city at a state general, primary, or special election a proposal to authorize the governing body of the city to impose a tax under this section.\n\n2. The ballot of submission for the tax authorized in this section shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the tax shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter immediately following notification to the department of revenue.

Upon the trial of the cause upon the question of foreclosure, the tax bill shall be prima facie proof that the tax described in the tax bill has been validly assessed at the time indicated by the tax bill and that the tax is unpaid. Any person alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in the tax bill or in the sale thereof must particularly specify in his answer the defect or basis of invalidity, and must, upon trial, affirmatively establish such defense.\n\n2. After the court has first determined the validity of the tax liens of all tax bills affecting parcels of real estate described in the petition, the priorities of the respective tax bills and the amounts due thereon, including principal, interest, penalties, attorney's fees, and costs, the court shall thereupon enter judgment of foreclosure of such liens and fix the time and place of the foreclosure sale. The petition shall be dismissed as to any parcel of real estate redeemed prior to the time fixed for the sheriff's foreclosure sale as provided in sections 92.700 to 92.920. If the parcel of real estate auctioned off at sheriff's foreclosure sale is sold for a sum sufficient to fully pay the principal amount of all tax bills included in the judgment, together with interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs, and for no more, and such sale is confirmed by the court, then all other proceedings as to such parcels of real estate shall be finally dismissed as to all parties and interests other than tax bill owners or holders; provided, however, that any parties seeking relief other than an interest in or lien upon the real estate may continue with said suit to a final adjudication of such other issues; provided, further, an appeal may be had as to any claim attacking the validity of the tax bill or bills or the priorities as to payment of proceeds of foreclosure sale. If the parcel of real estate auctioned off at sheriff's foreclosure sale is sold for a sum greater than the total amount necessary to pay the principal amount of all tax bills included in the judgment, together with interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs, and such sale is confirmed by the court, and no appeal is taken by any person claiming any right, title or interest in or to or lien upon said parcel of real estate or by any person or taxing authority owning or holding or claiming any right, title or interest in or to any tax bills within the time fixed by law for the filing of notice of appeal, the court shall thereupon order the sheriff to make distribution to the owners or holders of the respective tax bills included in the judgment of the amounts found to be due and in the order of priorities. Thereafter all proceedings in the suit shall be ordered by the court to be dismissed as to such persons or taxing authorities owning, holding or claiming any right, title or interest in any such tax bill or bills so paid, and the case shall proceed as to any parties claiming any right, title, or interest in or lien upon the parcel of real estate affected by such tax bill or bills as to their respective claims to such surplus funds then remaining in the hands of the sheriff. The receipt of such surplus funds shall constitute a bar to any claim of right, title, or interest in, or lien upon, said parcel of real estate, by the fund recipient.\n\n3. Whenever an answer is filed to the petition, as herein provided, a severance of the action as to all parcels of real estate affected by such answer shall be granted, and the issues raised by the petition and such answer shall be tried separate and apart from the other issues in the suit, but the granting of such severance shall not delay the trial or other disposition of any other issue in the case. A separate appeal may be taken from any other issue in the case. A separate appeal may be taken from any action of the court affecting any right, title or interest in or to, or lien upon, such real estate, other than issues of law and fact affecting the amount or validity of the lien of tax bills, but the proceeding to foreclose the lien of any tax bills shall not be stayed by such appeal. The trial shall be conducted by the court without the aid of a jury and the suit shall be in equity.

Confirmation of sales, when, procedure — proceeds of sale, how applied — occupancy permit, defined, when required, effect, failure to obtain, result — penalty for sale not confirmed, when, amount — set aside action, payment of redemption amount. —1. Within six months after the sheriff sells any parcel of real estate, the court shall, upon its own motion or upon motion of any interested party, set the cause down for hearing to confirm or set aside the foreclosure sale of the real estate, even though such parcels are not all of the parcels of real estate described in the notice of sheriff's foreclosure sale. Notice of the hearing shall be sent by any interested party, or the court, moving to confirm the foreclosure sale, to each person who was sent notice of sale as specified in subsections 4 and 5 of section 92.810 and to any other necessary parties as required by prevailing notions of due process. At the time of such hearing, the sheriff shall make report of the sale, and the court shall hear evidence of the value of the property offered on behalf of any interested party to the suit, and shall immediately determine whether an adequate consideration has been paid for each such parcel. Any parcel deemed to have been purchased by the land reutilization authority pursuant to section 92.830 shall not require any inquiry as to value. The court's judgment shall include a specific finding that adequate notice was provided to all necessary parties pursuant to prevailing notions of due process and sections 92.700 to 92.920, reciting the notice efforts of the collector, sheriff, and tax sale purchaser. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to preclude a successful tax sale purchaser from asserting a claim to quiet title to the bid upon parcel pursuant to section 527.150.\n\n2. For this purpose, the court shall have power to summon any city official or any private person to testify as to the reasonable value of the property, and if the court finds that adequate consideration has been paid, he shall confirm the sale and order the sheriff to issue a deed with restriction as provided herein to the purchaser subject to the application of an occupancy permit for all parcels as provided in subsection 7 of this section. If the court finds that the consideration paid is inadequate, the purchaser may increase his bid to such amount as the court may deem to be adequate, whereupon the court may confirm the sale. If, however, the purchaser declines to increase his bid and make such additional payment, then the sale shall be disapproved, the lien of the judgment continued, and such parcel of real estate shall be again advertised and offered for sale by the sheriff to the highest bidder at public auction for cash at any subsequent sheriff's foreclosure sale.\n\n3. If the sale is confirmed, the court shall order the proceeds of the sale applied in the following order:\n\n(1) To the payment of the costs of the publication of the notice of foreclosure and of the sheriff's foreclosure sale;\n\n(2) To the payment of all of the collector's**and sheriff's costs including appraiser's fee and attorney's fees;\n\n(3) To the payment of all tax bills adjudged to be due in the order of their priority, including principal, interest and penalties thereon. If, after such payment, there is any sum remaining of the proceeds of the sheriff's foreclosure sale, the court shall thereupon try and determine the other issues in the suit in accordance with section 92.775. If any answering parties have specially appealed as provided in section 92.845, the court shall retain the custody of such funds pending disposition of such appeal, and upon disposition of such appeal shall make such distribution. If there are not sufficient proceeds of the sale to pay all claims in any class described, the court shall order the same to be paid pro rata in accordance with the priorities.\n\n4. If there are any funds remaining of the proceeds after the sheriff's sale and after the distribution of such funds as set out in this section and no person entitled to any such funds, whether or not a party to the suit, shall, within two years after such sale, appear and claim the funds, ten percent shall be distributed to the St. Louis affordable housing trust fund or equivalent of such city operating under sections 92.700 to 92.920 for purposes that promote the reduction and prevention of vacant properties, blight remediation, and cleanup and maintenance of vacant property, with the remainder to be distributed to the appropriate taxing authorities.\n\n5. Any city operating under the provisions of sections 92.700 to 92.920, by ordinance, may elect to allocate a portion of its share of the proceeds of the sheriff's sale towards a fund for the purpose of defending against claims challenging the sufficiency of notice provisions under this section.\n\n6. For the purpose of this section, the term\"occupancy permit\"shall mean the certificate of inspection or occupancy permit for residential or commercial structures as provided for in the revised municipal code of any city not within a county, which now has or may hereafter have a population in excess of three hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\n7. If there is a building or structure on the parcel, the purchaser shall apply for an occupancy permit from the city or appropriate governmental agency within ten days after the confirmation hearing. Any purchaser who is a public corporation acting in a governmental capacity shall not be required to acquire the occupancy permit. When a parcel, acquired at a sheriff sale, containing a building is sold from a public corporation acting in a governmental capacity, the subsequent purchaser shall be required to apply for the occupancy permit. Failure to apply for such occupancy permit within ten days after confirmation shall result in the sale and confirmation being immediately set aside by the motion of any interested party and that parcel shall again be advertised and offered for sale by the sheriff to the highest bidder at public auction for cash at any subsequent sheriff foreclosure sale.\n\n8. The sheriff shall include a deed restriction in the sheriff's deed, issued after confirmation and after the application of an occupancy permit for any parcel containing a building or structure. The deed restriction shall state that the purchasers at the sheriff's sale who had the property confirmed and who applied for an occupancy permit shall obtain an occupancy permit for the building or structure from the appropriate governmental agency prior to any subsequent transfer or sale of this property. This deed restriction shall not exist as a lien against such real estate. The purchasers of the property at the sheriff sale who had the property confirmed and applied for the occupancy permit shall agree that in the event of their failure to obtain an occupancy permit prior to any subsequent transfer of the property, they shall pay to the sheriff the sum of five thousand dollars as fixed, liquidated and ascertained damages without proof of loss or damages. These damages shall not constitute a lien on property, and the sheriff shall have the discretionary power to file a lawsuit against such purchaser for collection of these liquidated damages. These liquidated damages shall be distributed on a prorated basis to the appropriate taxing authority after the sheriff deducts all costs, expenses and attorney's fees for such lawsuits. The sheriff may employ attorneys as he deems necessary to collect liquidated damages.\n\n9. If any sale is not confirmed within six months after the sale, any set-aside of the sale may, at the discretion of the court or collector, include a penalty of twenty-five percent of the bid amount over and above the opening bid amount, and such penalty shall be directed to the affordable housing trust fund or the equivalent, if any, of a city operating under sections 92.700 to 92.920.\n\n10. Any interested party, other than the sheriff's sale purchaser, who moves the court to set aside a sheriff's sale after the issuance of a sheriff's deed made under the provisions of sections 92.700 to 92.920 shall be required to pay into the court the redemption amount otherwise necessary under section 92.750 prior to the court hearing any such motion to set aside. The court may hear any motion to confirm brought under the terms of this section if the redemption amount is not paid by the interested party moving the court to set aside the sale.\n\n(L. 1971 H.B. 472 § 26, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1500, A.L. 1989 H.B. 342, A.L. 2022 H.B. 1606 merged with H.B. 1662)\n\n*Revisor's Note: This section was amended by both H.B. 1606 and H.B. 1662, 2022.
