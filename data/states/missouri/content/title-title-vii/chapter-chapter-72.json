If any city of the third or fourth classification or any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county proposes annexation by ordinance or resolution of any unincorporated area as defined in this subsection, no such annexation shall become effective until and only after a majority of the qualified voters in the unincorporated area proposed to be incorporated fail to approve or oppose the proposed incorporation by a majority vote in the election described in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n5.

As used in this subsection, a\"majority of the commercial or agricultural classification\"means a majority as determined by the assessed valuation of the tracts of real property in either classification to be determined by the assessments made according to chapter 137. The petition in such action shall state facts showing that such incorporation including the real property owned by the petitioners is not reasonable based on the same criteria as specified in subsection 3 of section 72.403 and is not necessary to the proper development of the city or town.

The commission shall review all proposed boundary changes of any area wholly or partially within the county. After June 27, 2000, no boundary change or unincorporated area proposal shall be submitted to or considered by the commission until April 15, 2001, except for consolidations. Any boundary change or unincorporated area proposal pending before the commission on June 27, 2000, shall be suspended on June 27, 2000, and shall be further considered after April 15, 2001, only if such proposal is reflected in a map plan submitted to the commission pursuant to section 72.423, except an annexation proposal by a village with a population under three thousand five hundred where the initial public hearing will occur prior to July 1, 1999, such proposal shall continue notwithstanding other provisions of law to the contrary. Review shall begin no later than thirty days after the plan of intent for the boundary change has been submitted to the commission by the proposing agent or thirty days after April 15, 2001, for boundary changes or unincorporated area proposals which are pending on June 27, 2000. The plan of intent shall address the criteria set forth in subsection 3 of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the term\"pending\"means any proposal submitted to the commission which has not yet been approved by the commission as a simplified annexation or approved for submission to the qualified voters of the voting jurisdictions. No simplified boundary change involving territory already described in an annexation resolution or incorporation petition filed with the commission shall occur unless the annexation or incorporation proposal has been disapproved by the commission or defeated by voters. If more than one proposed change is received from the same proposing agency, the review of each additional proposed change shall begin not later than thirty days after the date that review was commenced for the next preceding proposed change or thirty days after receipt of the proposed changes were received by the commission; except that, if more than one proposed change is received by the commission from the same proposing agency on the same date, the commission may establish the order of review.\n\n2. When a boundary change proposal has been submitted to the commission, the commission shall, within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, publish notice of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon in at least one newspaper of general circulation qualified to publish legal notices. Within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, the commission shall also mail written notification of such proposal and public hearing date to the county clerk, and to the city or village clerk of each municipality or village, and to any other political subdivision which, in the opinion of the commission, is materially affected by the proposal. The costs of publication and notification shall be borne by the proposing agent. The commission shall hold such public hearing concerning the proposal not less than fourteen nor more than sixty days after such publication and notification are complete. At such public hearing, the county, the proposing agent and affected municipalities shall be parties, and any other interested person, corporation, or political subdivision may also present evidence regarding the proposed boundary change. A boundary change proposal which has been disapproved by the commission and which is resubmitted with changes to the commission shall be subject to the public hearing requirement of this section, unless the commission determines that a public hearing on the resubmitted proposal is not necessary to achieve the objectives of sections 72.400 to 72.423.\n\n3. In reviewing any proposed boundary change, the commission shall approve such proposal if it finds that the boundary change will be in the best interest of the municipality or municipalities and unincorporated territories affected by the proposal and the areas of the county next to such proposed boundary. In making its determination, the commission shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) The impact, including but not limited to the impact on the tax base or on the ability to raise revenue, of such proposal on:\n\n(a) The area subject to the proposed boundary change and its residents;\n\n(b) The existing municipality or municipalities, if any, proposing the boundary change and the residents thereof;\n\n(c) Adjoining areas not involved in the boundary change and the residents thereof; and\n\n(d) The entire geographic area of the county and its residents;\n\n(2) A legal description of the area to be annexed, incorporated, consolidated, or subject to the transfer of jurisdiction;\n\n(3) The creation of logical and reasonable municipal boundaries in the county, and for such purpose the commission shall have the ability to make additions, deletions and modifications which address legal boundaries, technical or service delivery problems or boundaries which overlap those of other proposals; however, such additions, deletions and modifications shall not make substantial changes to any proposed boundary petition;\n\n(4) The present level of major services provided by the municipality or other provider, provided to the unincorporated area by the county, and proposed to be provided by the annexing municipality or municipality to be incorporated or consolidated, including, but not limited to, police protection, fire protection, water and sewer systems, street maintenance, utility agreements, parks, recreation, and refuse collections;\n\n(5) A proposed time schedule whereby the municipality or proposed municipality plans to provide such services to the residents of the area to be annexed, incorporated or consolidated within three years from the date the municipal boundary change is to become effective;\n\n(6) The current tax rates of the areas subject to the proposal;\n\n(7) What sources of revenue other than property tax are collected or are proposed to be collected by the municipality or proposed municipality;\n\n(8) The extraordinary effect the boundary change will have on the distribution of tax resources in the county;\n\n(9) How the municipality or proposed municipality proposes to zone any area not presently incorporated;\n\n(10) The compactness of the area subject to such proposal;\n\n(11) When the proposed boundary change shall become effective.\n\n4. The provisions of section 71.910 shall not apply to a proposing agent proceeding before the commission.\n\n5. Nothing in sections 72.400 to 72.423 shall be construed to prevent the boundary commission or its staff from advising proposing agents on issues related to proposals.

For any proposed boundary change submitted after August 28, 1995, the commission shall issue a finding approving or disapproving such proposals within nine months after such submittal, except that final action may be deferred on part or all of a boundary change proposal when necessary to accommodate an overlapping boundary change or unincorporated area proposal as more particularly provided in subsection 10 of this section. If the commission finds in favor of a proposed boundary change, it shall submit the question to the voters residing within the areas subject to the proposed boundary change, except as provided in subsection 6 of this section.\n\n2. If a boundary change is proposed by a municipality or the county and if the commission finds against the proposed boundary change submitted by a municipality or the county, it shall disapprove the boundary change proposal. In disapproving any boundary change proposal, the commission shall issue a document indicating the reasons such proposal was disapproved. No election shall be held on any such proposal not approved by the commission.\n\n3. If the boundary change is an incorporation proposed pursuant to a petition, the commission may make such changes in the proposal as it finds would result in an acceptable proposal, such changes to include but not be limited to additions, deletions or the modification of a proposal which contains boundaries which overlap those boundaries contained in any other proposal. After submittal, the commission may allow the proposing agent to make minor additions, deletions or modifications which do not substantially alter the proposal. When reviewing more than one boundary change proposal made by petition, the commission may consolidate two or more unincorporated areas into one proposed boundary change. Any changes made by the commission shall meet the criteria established pursuant to section 72.403.\n\n4. Where a proposal submitted by a municipality, the county or by a petition, contains more than two voting jurisdictions, the commission may provide for approval of a boundary change comprising only those municipalities and unincorporated area where a majority of voters approve the boundary change if the resulting municipality would meet the criteria established pursuant to section 72.403.\n\n5. If a boundary change is proposed by a municipality or the county and the commission determines that there is a minor error or discrepancy in the legal descriptions of the areas subject to the proposal as submitted by the municipality or county, then the commission with the concurrence of the proposing agent may make such changes to the proposal as are necessary to rectify the error in the legal description.\n\n6. A simplified boundary change may be proposed by:\n\n(1) A verified petition signed by seventy-five percent of the registered voters within the area proposed to be annexed which is predominately residential in character and has an average residential density of not less than one dwelling per three acres which is filed by the annexing municipality; or\n\n(2) Two municipalities for a transfer of jurisdiction between them or a municipality and the county for a transfer of jurisdiction between a municipality and the county.­­Within twenty-one days of receipt of a proposal pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall publish notice of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon in at least one newspaper of general circulation qualified to publish legal notices. The commission shall, within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, mail written notification of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon to the county clerk, and to the city or village clerk of each municipality or village, and to any other political subdivision which, in the opinion of the commission, is materially affected by such proposal. The commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the matter not less than fourteen nor more than sixty days after such publication and notification is complete. At the public hearing any interested person, corporation or political subdivision may present evidence regarding the proposed boundary change. Within four months of receipt of the proposal, the commission shall determine whether to disapprove the proposal, or to approve the proposal and allow it to proceed as an approved boundary change to be adopted or rejected by the voters pursuant to section 72.407, or to approve the proposal as a simplified boundary change, for which no vote shall be required, except that final action may be deferred on part or all of a simplified boundary change proposal when necessary to accommodate an overlapping boundary change or unincorporated area proposal as more particularly provided in subsection 10 of this section. In making its determination, the commission shall consider the factors set forth in subsection 3 of section 72.403. If the commission determines that the proposal should be approved as a simplified boundary change, such proposal shall become effective upon the date set forth in the commission's written report of approval.\n\n­­Within twenty-one days of receipt of a proposal pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall publish notice of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon in at least one newspaper of general circulation qualified to publish legal notices. The commission shall, within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, mail written notification of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon to the county clerk, and to the city or village clerk of each municipality or village, and to any other political subdivision which, in the opinion of the commission, is materially affected by such proposal. The commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the matter not less than fourteen nor more than sixty days after such publication and notification is complete. At the public hearing any interested person, corporation or political subdivision may present evidence regarding the proposed boundary change. Within four months of receipt of the proposal, the commission shall determine whether to disapprove the proposal, or to approve the proposal and allow it to proceed as an approved boundary change to be adopted or rejected by the voters pursuant to section 72.407, or to approve the proposal as a simplified boundary change, for which no vote shall be required, except that final action may be deferred on part or all of a simplified boundary change proposal when necessary to accommodate an overlapping boundary change or unincorporated area proposal as more particularly provided in subsection 10 of this section. In making its determination, the commission shall consider the factors set forth in subsection 3 of section 72.403. If the commission determines that the proposal should be approved as a simplified boundary change, such proposal shall become effective upon the date set forth in the commission's written report of approval.\n\n7. A municipality which wishes to propose a boundary change containing two or more unincorporated areas that are noncontiguous to each other shall submit separate proposals for the unincorporated areas that are noncontiguous to each other, in which case there shall be a separate vote for each proposal approved by the commission. The municipality may:\n\n(1) Adopt and submit separate ordinances for each such separate proposal; or\n\n(2) Adopt and submit one ordinance containing said separate proposals, which ordinance shall clearly state that the municipality is making multiple, separate proposals, and is desirous of separate votes for each separate proposal. The ordinance shall also clearly identify each separate proposal that the municipality is making.\n\n8. The commission shall not approve any boundary change proposal in which more than fifty percent of the combined land subject to the proposal is unincorporated territory or territories unless the area subject to the proposal has a population of more than ten thousand persons.\n\n9. A proposing agent may modify its proposal and submit additional information during the review period.\n\n10. The commission may defer final action on part or all of a boundary change proposal or proposal for an established unincorporated area beyond the periods provided for their consideration in order to allow an election with respect to an overlapping boundary change or unincorporated area proposal in order to maximize the ability of voters to determine their own status. Such deferral may be ordered only when the proposal granted such priority is filed with the commission no later than sixty days after the proposal on which action will be deferred and only when the commission determines that the population of the overlapping area is a greater proportion of the proposal given priority than of the proposal on which action is deferred. The commission shall take final action on the deferred proposal within forty-five days of the election at which the proposal granted priority is decided. The proposing agent may modify the proposal in accordance with the results of the election.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 487 § 3 subsecs. 1 to 5, A.L. 1991 S.B. 402, A.L. 1992 S.B. 571, A.L. 1995 H.B. 446, A.L. 1998 S.B. 809, A.L. 1999 S.B. 160 & 82, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1967)\n\nEffective 6-27-00",

The provisions of this section shall apply to the consolidation of two or more cities, towns, villages, unincorporated areas, or any combination thereof, in any county with a charter form of government where fifty or more cities, towns and villages have been incorporated. If a boundary commission has been established pursuant to section 72.400, such proposal shall be submitted to the commission, but if no such commission has been established, consolidation of such areas shall be accomplished pursuant to this section. All municipalities and unincorporated areas which may be consolidated under the procedures established in this section must be contiguous to each other, so that if the consolidation is approved by the voters pursuant to subsections 7 to 9 of this section, there will be one municipality with all parts contiguous to at least one other portion of the new municipality.\n\n2. Whenever a petition for consolidation containing the signatures of at least fifteen percent of the qualified voters of each municipality or unincorporated area, determined on the basis of the number of votes cast for governor at the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition, is received by the governing body of the county, the governing body of the county shall submit the question of consolidation to the qualified voters of each municipality and unincorporated area named in the petition at the next state or county primary, general or special election. The petition need not contain signatures of qualified voters of a municipality if the governing body of such municipality adopts an ordinance approving the proposed consolidation which meets the requirements of subsection 5 of this section, and sends a copy of the ordinance to the governing body of the county in conjunction with the petition prescribed by this subsection.\n\n3.

The costs of an election held under this section shall be assessed proportionately to each municipality; however, when a voting jurisdiction is composed of unincorporated territory or territories, all costs of the election in such voting jurisdictions shall be paid proportionally by each municipality in the proposed consolidation. Proportional election costs paid under this section shall be assessed by charging each municipality the same percentage of the total cost of the election as the number of registered voters of the municipality on the day of the election is to the total number of registered voters on the day of the election, derived by adding together the number of registered voters in each municipality.\n\n7.

Petition to remain unincorporated — unincorporated area proposal, procedure for creating established unincorporated areas — no boundary change to affect established unincorporated area prior to expiration. —1. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 72.400 to 72.420 to the contrary, residents of an unincorporated area of a county may remain unincorporated and not subject to any boundary change pursuant to sections 72.400 to 72.420 if the following are satisfied:\n\n(1) The county petitions the boundary commission;\n\n(2) A legal description of the unincorporated area accompanies the petition. If there is a minor error or discrepancy in the legal description of the unincorporated area, the commission, with the concurrence of the county, may make such changes to the proposal as are necessary to rectify the error in the legal description;\n\n(3) The unincorporated area either contains a population of not less than two thousand five hundred or is contiguous with an existing established unincorporated area;\n\n(4) A plan of intent accompanies the petition addressing the issues to be considered by the commission.\n\n2. When an unincorporated area proposal has been submitted to the commission, the commission shall, within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, publish notice of such proposal and the date of the public hearing thereon in at least one newspaper of general circulation qualified to publish legal notices. Within twenty-one days of receipt of such proposal, the commission shall also mail written notification of such proposal and public hearing date to the county clerk, and to the city or village clerk of each neighboring municipality or village, and to any other political subdivision which, in the opinion of the commission, is materially affected by the proposal. The costs of publication and notification shall be borne by the county. The commission shall hold such public hearing concerning the proposal not less than fourteen nor more than sixty days after such publication and notification are complete. At such public hearing, the county and any municipality with an overlapping map plan shall be parties, and any other interested person, corporation, or political subdivision may also present evidence regarding the unincorporated area proposal. An unincorporated area proposal which has been disapproved by the commission and which is resubmitted with changes to the commission shall be subject to the public hearing requirement of this section, unless the commission determines that a public hearing on the resubmitted proposal is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this section. The commission shall issue findings approving or disapproving such proposal within nine months after submittal, except that final action may be deferred on part or all of an unincorporated proposal when necessary to accommodate an overlapping boundary change proposal as more particularly provided in subsection 10 of section 72.405. The proposal shall be submitted at the next general or special election in accordance with the provisions of chapter 115. The cost of the election shall be paid by the county. If the proposal is approved by the voters then the area shall be an established unincorporated area and shall remain unincorporated territory for a period of five years from the date of the vote and shall not be subject to any boundary change pursuant to sections 72.400 to 72.420.\n\n3. In reviewing any proposed unincorporated area proposal, the commission shall approve such proposal if it finds that continued provision of local services to the area by the county will not impose an unreasonable burden on county government and that such designation is in the best interest of the unincorporated territories affected by the proposal and the areas of the county next to such area. In making its determination, the commission shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) The impact, including but not limited to the impact on the tax base or on the ability to raise revenue, of such proposal on:\n\n(a) The area subject to the proposed established unincorporated area and its residents;\n\n(b) Adjoining areas not involved in the proposed established area and the residents thereof; and\n\n(c) The entire geographic area of the county and its residents;\n\n(2) A legal description of the unincorporated area;\n\n(3) The creation of logical and reasonable municipal boundaries in the county, and for such purpose the commission shall have the ability to make additions, deletions and modifications which address legal boundaries, technical or service delivery problems or boundaries which overlap those of other proposals; however, such additions, deletions and modifications shall not make substantial changes to any proposed unincorporated area proposal;\n\n(4) Whether approval of the unincorporated area proposal will result in unreasonable difficulty in provision of services by the county;\n\n(5) The effect approval of the established unincorporated area will have on the distribution of tax resources in the county;\n\n(6) The compactness of the area subject to such proposal.\n\n4. After approval by the voters of an unincorporated area proposal, no boundary change affecting any part of such area shall be proposed to the commission until expiration of the area's status as an established unincorporated area, but map plans affecting the area may be filed during the planning period pursuant to section 72.423. If no map plan of a boundary change proposal with respect to an established unincorporated area has been submitted during the most recent planning period pursuant to section 72.423, the commission shall commence review of the circumstances of such established unincorporated area six months prior to its expiration, and shall submit reauthorization of such unincorporated area to the voters if the commission determines that its circumstances have not materially changed since it was approved.\n\n(L. 1998 S.B. 809, A.L. 1999 S.B. 160 & 82, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1967)\n\nEffective 6-27-00",
