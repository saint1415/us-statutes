Except as provided in this section, an assignee of a policy or contract shall not be deemed a policyholder. The reference in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 to insurance in the amount of one thousand dollars or more is deemed to include any annuity contract, the commuted value of which is one thousand dollars or more on the date of said meeting, and any pure endowment contract for the principal sum of one thousand dollars or more.\n\n3.

The meeting shall be otherwise provided for and conducted in such manner as is provided in the mutualization plan, provided that policyholders may vote in person, by proxy, or by mail, and that all votes shall be cast by ballot on a uniform ballot furnished by the corporation. The director of the department of commerce and insurance shall supervise and direct the method and procedure of said meeting and shall appoint an adequate number of inspectors to conduct the voting at said meeting who may determine all questions concerning the verification of the ballots, the ascertainment of the validity of such ballots, the qualifications of the voters, and the canvass of the vote, and who shall certify to the director and to the corporation the result of such proceedings, which shall be supervised by said inspectors in accordance with such rules and regulations as are prescribed by the director.

Before such a plan can be carried out, it must be submitted to the director of the department of commerce and insurance and must be approved by him in writing; provided that every payment for the acquisition of any shares of the capital stock of such corporation, the purchase price of which is not fixed by such plan, shall be subject to the approval of the director, and provided that neither such plan, nor any such payment, shall be approved by the director unless at the time of such approvals, respectively, the corporation, after deducting the aggregate sum appropriated by such plan for the acquisition of any part or all of its capital stock, and, in the case of any payment not fixed by such plan and subject to separate approval by the director, after deducting also the amount of such payment, shall be possessed of assets sufficient to maintain its deposit made previously with the director, and such assets shall be not less than the entire liabilities of the corporation, including the net values of its outstanding contracts computed according to the standard adopted by the corporation under sections 376.010 to 376.670 and including all funds, contingent reserves, and surplus, except for such surplus as has been appropriated or paid under such plan.\n\n(L. 1957 p. 224 § 1)",

If a stockholder of any domestic stock life insurance corporation planning to become a mutual life insurance corporation under section 376.142 files with the corporation prior to or at the meeting of the stockholders at which the plan is submitted to a vote, a written objection to such plan and does not vote in favor thereof, and such stockholder within twenty days after the plan is approved by such meeting makes written demand on the corporation for payment of the fair cash value of his shares as of the day prior to the date on which such plan is approved by the stockholders, excluding from such fair cash value any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of such mutualization, such stockholder shall be entitled to receive, within ninety days after such fair cash value is agreed upon or determined, upon surrender of his certificates representing his shares, such fair cash value thereof. Any stockholder who fails to make such objection or having objected fails to make demand within the twenty-day period shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the plan and shall be bound by the terms thereof.\n\n2. Any such objection and demand for the payment of the fair cash value of shares shall state the number and kind of shares held by the dissenting stockholder making the demand, and the amount which such stockholder claims is their fair cash value.\n\n3. The right of a dissenting stockholder to be paid the fair cash value of his shares shall cease when the corporation, for any reason and in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section, abandons the plan to mutualize the corporation.\n\n4. No demand for payment of such fair cash value may be withdrawn by the stockholder making the same unless the corporation, by its board of directors, consents to such withdrawal.\n\n5. Within ten days after the receipt of any such demand the corporation shall inform such stockholder in writing whether it will pay the demanded amount, and, if it refuses to pay such amount, it shall offer in writing to pay another amount as such fair cash value.\n\n6. If, within thirty days after the date of the written demand made by the dissenting stockholder, the value of such shares is agreed upon between the dissenting stockholder and the corporation and such value is approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance, payment therefor shall be made within ninety days after the date of such agreement, upon the surrender of the stockholder's certificates representing such shares. Upon payment of the agreed value the dissenting stockholder ceases to have any interest in such shares and ceases to be a stockholder in the corporation, but the shares previously held by him and upon which he has been paid such fair cash value shall be transferred to and held by the trustees appointed under subsections 2 and 3 of section 376.143 for benefit of the corporation.\n\n7. If, within such period of thirty days, the stockholder and the corporation do not agree upon the value of the shares, the corporation, or the dissenting stockholder if he has complied with this section, may, within sixty days after the expiration of the thirty-day period, petition the circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the corporation is located, to determine the fair cash value of the shares mentioned in such demand as of the day before the vote was taken approving such plan.\n\n8. If such petition is not filed within the sixty-day period, the fair cash value of the shares is conclusively deemed to be equal to the amount offered to the dissenting stockholder by the corporation if any such offer has been made or, if not, then an amount equal to that demanded by the dissenting stockholder.\n\n9. The petition shall contain a brief statement of the facts and shall show the vote and action objected to and facts entitling such dissenting stockholder to the relief demanded.\n\n10. Upon the filing of such petition, the court, on the motion of the petitioner, shall enter an order fixing a date for hearing, and requiring a notice of the filing and prayer of such petition and of the date for hearing to be given to the respondent or defendant in the manner in which a summons is required to be served or substituted service is required to be made in other cases.\n\n11. On the day fixed for the hearing of such petition, or any adjournment thereof, the court shall determine from the petition and such evidence as is submitted by either party whether the dissenting stockholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any shares, and the number of such shares, and if the court finds and orders that such stockholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any number of shares, the court shall appoint three appraisers to determine the fair cash value of such number of shares as of the day before the vote objected to was taken, excluding from such fair cash value any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the mutualization or vote of the corporation, and said court shall further instruct the appraisers respecting their duties in making such determination.\n\n12. The appraisers shall forthwith proceed to determine said fair cash value and said appraisers, or a majority of them, shall make a report or award within ten days, unless the court increases said time, and shall file such report in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, whereupon, on the motion of either party, said report shall be submitted to the court and considered on such evidence as the court considers relevant, and if said award is found to be reasonable, and is confirmed and approved by the court, judgment shall be rendered against the corporation for the payment of the amount of the award, with interest at six percent from a date which shall be fixed in such judgment.\n\n13. If such appraisers, or a majority of them, fail to make and file an award within ten days, or within such further time as may be fixed by the court, or the award is not confirmed by the court, it shall summarily determine the fair cash value of said number of shares and render judgment therefor.\n\n14. Any judgment shall further provide that simultaneously with its payment the certificates evidencing the shares of stock affected shall be surrendered to the corporation and, upon the failure of the holder thereof to surrender such certificates, the judgment shall stand as a cancellation of such certificates.\n\n15. The cost of the proceedings, including reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable.\n\n16. Such a proceeding is considered as a special proceeding and shall be advanced upon the court's docket, and final orders therein may be reviewed, affirmed, modified or reversed as in other civil actions or proceedings.\n\n17. Two or more dissenting stockholders may join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in any proceeding under this section, and two or more such proceedings may be consolidated.\n\n18. A stockholder who so objects in writing and demands in writing payment of the fair cash value of any shares shall not be entitled to vote such shares or to exercise any rights respecting such shares or to receive any dividends or distributions thereon, unless the plan of mutualization is abandoned, or, with the consent of the corporation, the objection and demand are withdrawn; provided that if, prior to such abandonment, dividends are paid in money to stockholders who are of record on or after the day on which the vote was taken authorizing such mutualization, then an amount of money equal to the dividends otherwise payable upon such dissenting shares shall be paid to the holders of record thereof who would, except for their dissent, be entitled to receive such dividends, and each such payment shall be a credit upon the total amount to be paid for such shares by the corporation. All the holders of such dissenting shares of record at the time of any such abandonment, shall thereupon be restored to the status of a stockholder, and any payments made previously on such shares shall be considered as dividends thereon.\n\n19. Any stockholder who has assented to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the assenting stockholders, and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value, but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled, may be ordered to do so by a decree of the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose, and such decree may provide that, upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation, the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation.\n\n20. At any time before there has been a vote of the policyholders approving a plan of mutualization, the corporation may abandon such plan by the same vote of the directors and of the stockholders as was required for its adoption. Upon such abandonment, the rights of any stockholders to be paid for their stock in accordance with the plan, and the rights of any dissenting stockholders to be paid the fair cash value of their stock, whether or not judgment may have been rendered therefor, shall terminate, and the corporation shall continue to conduct its business as a domestic stock life insurance corporation as though no plan of mutualization had ever been adopted.\n\n(L. 1957 p. 224 § 3)",

The articles of agreement of any mutual life insurance corporation shall provide that each policyholder of the corporation shall be a member of the corporation.\n\n2. As used in this section,\"policyholder\"means the person insured under an individual policy of life insurance, and the person to whom any annuity or pure endowment is presently or prospectively payable by the terms of an individual annuity or pure endowment contract, except where the policy or contract declares some other person to be the owner or holder thereof, in which case such owner or policyholder shall be deemed the policyholder, and except in cases of assignment. In the case of any individual policy or contract insuring two or more persons jointly or in case the policy or contract declares two or more persons to be the owner, the persons insured or declared to be the owner are considered as one policyholder. In case any such policy or contract has been assigned by an assignment absolute on its face to an assignee other than the corporation and such assignment is filed at the principal office of the corporation, then such assignee shall be deemed a policyholder, but for the purpose of determining voting rights such assignment is not effective until thirty days after it has been filed with the corporation.

The power to make, alter, amend, or repeal the articles of agreement is vested in the board of directors or trustees, unless it is reserved to the members by the articles of incorporation.\n\n5.

The provisions and definitions of terms of section 375.345 related to derivative transactions shall also apply to investments under this chapter.\n\n(2) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, an insurer shall not acquire or hold an investment as an admitted asset unless at the time of acquisition:\n\n(a) It is eligible for the payment or accrual of interest or discount, whether in cash or other forms of income or securities, eligible to receive dividends or other distributions or is otherwise income producing; or\n\n(b) It is acquired under section 375.345, subsection 3 of section 376.302, section 376.303 or 376.307 or under the authority of sections of the code other than sections 376.291 to 376.307.\n\n(3) An insurer may acquire or hold as admitted assets investments that do not otherwise qualify, as provided in sections 376.291 to 376.307, if this insurer has not acquired the assets investments for the purpose of circumventing any limitations contained in sections 376.291 to 376.307 and if the insurer acquires the investments in the following circumstances and complies with the provisions of sections 376.291 to 376.307 as to the investments:\n\n(a) As a payment on account of existing indebtedness or in connection with the refinancing, restructuring, or workout of existing indebtedness, if taken to protect the insurer's interest in that investment;\n\n(b) As realization of collateral for indebtedness;\n\n(c) In connection with an otherwise qualified investment or investment practice as interest on, or a dividend, or other distribution related to the investment or investment practice or in connection with the refinancing of the investment. In each case, no additional or only nominal consideration is necessary;\n\n(d) Under lawful and bona fide agreement of recapitalization or voluntary or involuntary reorganization in connection with an investment held by the insurer; or\n\n(e) Under a bulk reinsurance, merger, or consolidation transaction approved by the director if the assets constitute admissible investments for the ceding, merged, or consolidated companies.\n\n(4) An investment or portion of an investment acquired by an insurer under subdivision (3) of this subsection shall become a nonadmitted asset three years, or five years in the case of mortgage loans and real estate, from the date of its acquisition unless within that period the investment has become a qualified investment under a section of this chapter other than subdivision (3) of this subsection, but an investment acquired under an agreement of bulk reinsurance, merger, or consolidation may be qualified for a longer period if so provided in the plan for reinsurance, merger, or consolidation as approved by the director. Upon application by the insurer and a showing that the nonadmission of an asset held under subdivision (3) of this subsection would materially injure the interests of the insurer, the director may extend the period of admissibility for an additional, reasonable period of time.\n\n(5) Except as provided in subdivisions (6) and (8) of this subsection, an investment shall qualify under this chapter if on the date the insurer committed to acquire the investment or on the date of its acquisition it would have qualified under this chapter. For the purposes of determining limitations contained in this chapter, an insurer shall give appropriate recognition to any commitments to acquire investments.\n\n(6) (a) An investment held as an admitted asset by an insurer on August 28, 2007, which qualified under this chapter, or chapter 375, shall remain qualified as an admitted asset.\n\n(b) Each specific transaction constituting an investment practice of the type described in this chapter that was lawfully entered into by an insurer and was in effect on August 28, 2007, shall continue to be permitted under this chapter until its expiration or termination under its terms, including any expiration or termination after an extension under its terms.\n\n(7) Unless otherwise specified, an investment limitation computed on the basis of an insurer's admitted assets or capital and surplus shall relate to the amount required to be shown on the statutory balance sheet of the insurer most recently required to be filed, annual or last quarter, with the director. Solely for the purposes of computing any limitation based upon admitted assets, the insurer shall deduct from the amount of its admitted assets the amount of the liability recorded on such statutory balance sheet for:\n\n(a) The return of acceptable collateral received in a reverse repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction;\n\n(b) Cash received in a dollar-roll transaction; and\n\n(c) The amount reported as borrowed money in such statutory balance sheet to the extent not included in paragraph (b) and this paragraph of this subdivision.\n\n(8) An investment qualified, in whole or in part, for acquisition or holding as an admitted asset may be qualified or requalified at the time of acquisition or a later date, in whole or in part, under any section if the relevant conditions contained in the other section are satisfied at the time of the qualification or requalification.\n\n(9) An insurer shall maintain documentation demonstrating that investments were acquired in accordance with this chapter.\n\n(10) An insurer shall not enter into an agreement to purchase securities in advance of their issuance for resale to the public as part of a distribution of the securities by the issuer or otherwise guarantee the distribution, except that an insurer may acquire privately placed securities with registration rights.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the director, for good cause, may order an insurer to nonadmit, limit, dispose of, withdraw from, or discontinue an investment or investment practice. The authority of the director under this subsection is in addition to any other authority of the director.\n\n2. (1) Within three months after August 28, 2007, an insurer's board of directors shall adopt a written plan for acquiring and holding investments and for engaging in investment practices that specifies guidelines as to the quality, maturity, and diversification of the investments and other specifications, including investment strategies intended to assure that the investments and investment practices are appropriate for the business conducted by the insurer, its liquidity needs, and its capital and surplus. The board shall review and assess the insurer's technical investment and administrative capabilities and expertise before adopting a written plan concerning an investment strategy or investment practice.\n\n(2) Investments acquired and held under this chapter and section 375.345 shall be acquired and held under the supervision and direction of the board of directors of the insurer. The board of directors shall evidence by formal resolution at least annually that it has determined whether all investments have been made in accordance with delegations, standards, limitations, and investment objectives prescribed by the board or a committee of the board charged with the responsibility to direct its investments.\n\n(3) On no less than a quarterly basis and more often if deemed appropriate, an insurer's board of directors or committee of the board of directors shall:\n\n(a) Receive and review a summary report on the insurer's investment portfolio, its investment activities, and investment practices engaged in under delegated authority in order to determine whether the investment activity of the insurer is consistent with its written plan; and\n\n(b) Review and revise, as appropriate, the written plan.\n\n(4) In discharging its duties under this section, the board of directors shall require that records of any authorization or approvals, other documentation as the board may require, and reports of any action taken under authority delegated under the plan referred to in subsection 1 of this section shall be made available on a regular basis to the board of directors.\n\n(5) In discharging their duties under this section, the directors of an insurer shall perform their duties in good faith and with that degree of care that ordinarily prudent individuals in like positions would use under similar circumstances.\n\n(6) If an insurer does not have a board of directors, all references to the board of directors in sections 376.291 to 376.307 shall be deemed to be references to the governing body of the insurer having authority equivalent to that of a board of directors.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 66)",

For residential mortgage loans, the eighty percent limitation may be increased to ninety-seven percent if acceptable private mortgage insurance has been obtained; or\n\n(c) Seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the real estate for mortgage loans that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdivision.\n\n(2) For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the amount of an obligation required to be included in the calculation of the loan-to-value ratio may be reduced to the extent the obligation is insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, or their successor.\n\n(3) Subject to the limitations of section 376.297, an insurer may acquire directly or indirectly through limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by subsection 4 of section 376.294, joint ventures, stock of an investment subsidiary or membership interests in a limited liability company, trust certificates, or other similar instruments or obligations secured by a second mortgage on real estate situated within a domestic jurisdiction other than as authorized in subdivision (1) of this subsection. The obligation held by the insurer shall be the sole second lien priority obligation and shall not at the time of acquisition of the obligation exceed seventy percent of the amount by which the fair market value of the real estate exceeds the amount outstanding under the first mortgage.\n\n(4) A mortgage loan that is held by an insurer under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of section 376.293 or acquired under this section and is restructured in a manner that meets the requirements of a restructured mortgage loan in accordance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual or its successor publication shall continue to qualify as a mortgage loan.\n\n(5) Subject to the limitations of section 376.297, credit lease transactions that do not qualify for investment under section 376.298 with the following characteristics shall be exempt from the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection:\n\n(a) The loan amortizes over the initial fixed lease term at least in an amount sufficient so that the loan balance at the end of the lease term does not exceed the original appraised value of the real estate;\n\n(b) The lease payments cover or exceed the total debt service over the life of the loan;\n\n(c) A tenant or its affiliated entity whose rated credit instruments have a SVO \"1\" or \"2\" designation or a comparable rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization recognized by the SVO has a full faith and credit obligation to make the lease payments;\n\n(d) The insurer holds or is the beneficial holder of a first lien mortgage on the real estate;\n\n(e) The expenses of the real estate are passed through to the tenant, excluding exterior structural, parking and heating, ventilation and air conditioning replacement expenses, unless annual escrow contributions from cash flows derived from the lease payments cover the expense shortfall; and\n\n(f) There is a perfected assignment of the rents due under the lease to or for the benefit of the insurer.\n\n2. (1) An insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate situated in a domestic jurisdiction directly or indirectly through limited partnership interests and general partnership interests not otherwise prohibited by subsection 4 of section 376.294, joint ventures, stock of an investment subsidiary or membership interests in a limited liability company, trust certificates, or other similar instruments. The real estate shall be income producing or intended for improvement or development for investment purposes under an existing program in which case the real estate shall be deemed to be income producing.\n\n(2) The real estate may be subject to mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances, and the amount of which shall, to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer, be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate for purposes of determining compliance with subdivisions (2) and (3) of subsection 4 of this section.\n\n3. An insurer may acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate for the convenient accommodation of the insurer's (which may include its affiliates) business operations, including home office, branch office, and field office operations. Such real estate acquired may:\n\n(1) Include excess space for rent to others if the excess space at its fair market value would otherwise be a permitted investment under subsection 2 of this section and is so qualified by the insurer; or\n\n(2) Be subject to one or more mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance, and the amount of which shall, to the extent that the obligations secured by the mortgages, liens, or encumbrances are without recourse to the insurer, be deducted from the amount of the investment of the insurer in the real estate for purposes of determining compliance with subsection 4 of this section.\n\n­­For purposes of this subsection, business operations shall not include that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services by an accident and health insurer for its insureds. An insurer may acquire real estate used for these purposes under subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. An insurer may not acquire an investment:\n\n(1) Under subsection 1 of this section, if as a result of, and after giving effect to the investment, the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer under subsection 1 of this section would not exceed:\n\n(a) One percent of its admitted assets in mortgage loans covering any one secured location;\n\n(b) One-fourth of one percent of its admitted assets in construction loans covering any one secured location; or\n\n(c) Two percent of its admitted assets in construction loans in the aggregate;\n\n(2) Under subsection 2 of this section if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any outstanding guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of investments then held by the insurer under subsection 2 of this section plus the guarantees then outstanding would exceed:\n\n(a) One percent of its admitted assets in one parcel or group of contiguous parcels of real estate, except that this limitation shall not apply to that portion of real estate used for the direct provision of health care services by an accident and health insurer for its insureds, such as hospitals, medical clinics, medical professional buildings, or other health facilities for the purposes of providing health services; or\n\n(b) Fifteen percent of its admitted assets in the aggregate but not more than five percent of its admitted assets in real estate to be improved or developed;\n\n(3) Under subsection 1 or 2 of this section if as a result of and after giving effect to the investment and any guarantees made by the insurer in connection with the investment the aggregate amount of all investments then held by the insurer under subsections 1 and 2 of this section plus the guarantees then outstanding would exceed forty-five percent of its admitted assets. However, an insurer may exceed this limitation by no more than thirty percent of its admitted assets if:\n\n(a) This increased amount is invested only in residential mortgage loans;\n\n(b) The insurer has no more than ten percent of its admitted assets invested in mortgage loans other than residential mortgage loans;\n\n(c) The loan-to-value ratio of each residential mortgage loan does not exceed sixty percent at the time the mortgage loan is qualified under this increased authority and the fair market value is supported by an appraisal no more than two years old prepared by an independent appraiser;\n\n(d) A single mortgage loan qualified under this increased authority does not exceed one-half of one percent of its admitted assets;\n\n(e) The insurer files with the director and receives approval from the director for a plan that is designed to result in a portfolio of residential mortgage loans that is geographically diversified; and\n\n(f) The insurer agrees to file annually with the director records that demonstrate that its portfolio of residential mortgage loans is geographically diversified in accordance with the plan.\n\n­­The limitations of section 376.297 shall not apply to an insurer's acquisition of real estate under subsection 3 of this section. An insurer shall not acquire real estate under subsection 3 of this section if as a result of and after giving effect to the acquisition the aggregate amount of real estate then held by the insurer under subsection 3 of this section would exceed ten percent of its admitted assets. With the permission of the director, additional amounts of real estate may be acquired under subsection 3 of this section.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 66)",

The income, if any, and gains and losses, realized or unrealized, on such account shall be credited to or charged against the amounts allocated to such account without regard to other income, gains or losses of the company. If and to the extent so provided under the applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of any such separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to such account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct.\n\n2. Any domestic life insurance company may, after adoption of a resolution by its board of directors, establish one or more separate accounts, and may allocate to such account or accounts any amounts paid to or held by it which are to be applied under the terms of an individual or group contract to provide benefits payable in fixed or in variable dollar amounts or in both.\n\n3.

The provisions of this section shall not affect existing laws pertaining to the voting rights of such company's policyholders.\n\n4. The amounts allocated to any separate account and the accumulations thereon may be invested and reinvested without regard to any requirements or limitations prescribed by the laws of this state governing the investments of life insurance companies, and the investments in such separate account or accounts shall not be taken into account in applying the investment limitations, including but not limited to quantitative restrictions, otherwise applicable to the investments of the company, except that to the extent that the company's reserve liability with regard to benefits guaranteed as to principal amount and duration, and funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest, is maintained in any separate account, a portion of the assets of such separate account at least equal to such reserve liability shall be, except as the director might otherwise approve, invested in accordance with the laws of this state governing the general investment account of any company. As used herein, the expression\"general investment account\"shall mean all of the funds, assets and investments of the company which are not allocated in a separate account. The provisions of section 376.170 relating to deposits for registered policies shall not be applicable to funds and investments allocated to separate accounts. No investment in the separate account or in the general investment account of a life insurance company shall be transferred by sale, exchange, substitution or otherwise from one account to another unless, in case of a transfer into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the contracts with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made or unless the transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made by a transfer of cash, or by a transfer of other assets having a readily determinable market value, provided that such transfer of other assets is approved by the director and is for assets of equivalent value. Such transfer shall be deemed approved to the extent the assets of a separate account so transferred have been paid to or are being held by the company in connection with a pension, retirement or profit-sharing plan subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The director may withdraw such deemed approval by providing written notice to the company that its financial condition or past practices require such withdrawal. The director may approve other transfers among such accounts if the director concludes that such transfers would be equitable.\n\n5. Unless otherwise approved by the director, assets allocated to a separate account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then as provided under the terms of the contract or the rules or other written agreement applicable to such separate account; provided, that the portion of the assets of such separate account at least equal to the company's reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in subsection 4 of this section, if any, shall be valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the company's assets.\n\n6. The director shall have the sole and exclusive authority to regulate the issuance and authority to regulate the sale of contracts under which amounts are to be allocated to one or more separate accounts as provided herein, and to issue such reasonable rules, regulations and licensing requirements as the director shall deem necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section; and the companies that issue such contracts shall not be subject to registration with the commissioner of securities. The director may, subject to the provisions of section 374.185, consult and cooperate with the commissioner of securities in investigations arising from the offer and sale of contracts regulated under this section and may request assistance from the commissioner of securities in any proceeding arising from the offer and sale of any such contracts.\n\n7. No domestic life insurance company, and no other life insurance company admitted to transact business in this state, shall be authorized to deliver within this state any contract under which amounts are to be allocated to one or more separate accounts as provided herein until said company has satisfied the director that its condition or methods of operation in connection with the issuance of such contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or its policyholders in this state. In determining the qualifications of a company requesting authority to deliver such contracts within this state, the director shall consider, among other things:\n\n(1) The history and financial condition of the company;\n\n(2) The character, responsibility and general fitness of the officers and directors of the company; and\n\n(3) In the case of a company other than a domestic company, whether the statutes and regulations of the jurisdiction of its incorporation provide a degree of protection to policyholders and the public which is substantially equal to that provided by this section and the rules and regulations issued thereunder.\n\n8.

If the contract provides for payment of benefits in variable amounts, it shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedure to be followed by the company in determining the dollar amount of such variable benefits. Any such contract, including a group contract, and any certificate issued thereunder, shall state that such dollar amount may decrease or increase and shall contain on its first page a statement that the benefits thereunder are on a variable basis.\n\n10.

All life insurance companies organized under the laws of this state shall ascertain and distribute annually, and not otherwise, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the proportion of any surplus accruing upon every participating policy or contract issued on or after January 1, 1946, entitled as herein provided to share in such surplus. Upon the thirty-first day of December of each year, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, every such company shall well and truly ascertain the surplus earned by it during the year.\n\n2. After setting aside from such surplus such sums as may be required for the payment of authorized dividends upon the capital stock, if any, such sums as may properly be held for account of outstanding deferred dividend policies, if any, and such sums as may be deemed advisable for the accumulation of a surplus in an amount not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars, or ten percent of its policy reserves and policy liabilities, whichever shall be greater, every such company shall thereupon apportion the remainder of such surplus earnings, if any, derived from participating policies or contracts, as the board of directors charged with the management of the company's affairs may determine, to all policies or contracts entitled to share therein during the full dividend year adopted by the company for such purpose beginning not later than the following July first.\n\n3. Dividends apportioned as aforesaid in the case of a policy or contract, other than an industrial life insurance policy, issued on or after the first day of January, 1946, shall, unless otherwise provided in the policy or contract, be payable upon the anniversary of the policy or contract occurring within the dividend year selected by the company, as aforesaid; and in every case after the first policy or contract year such dividend shall be payable upon the sole condition that the premium payments of the policy or contract year current upon the first day of the dividend year selected by the company, as aforesaid, shall have been completed. Such apportionment in the case of any policy or contract shall not, after the first policy year, be made contingent upon the payment of the whole or any part of the premium for any subsequent year.\n\n4. (1) Except as herein provided, the dividend so apportioned in the case of any participating policy issued on or after the first day of January, 1946, shall, at the option of the person entitled to elect such option, be either\n\n(a) Payable in cash; or\n\n(b) Applicable to the payment of any premium or premiums upon said policy; or\n\n(c) Permitted to accumulate to the credit of the policy or contract at such rate of interest as may be allowed by the company, and with such interest shall be payable upon the maturity of the policy or shall be withdrawable in cash on any anniversary of the date of issue thereof; or\n\n(d) If so provided in the policy, applicable to any paid-up addition thereto.\n\n(2) Unless the insured or owner of the policy notifies the company in writing of his election of one of the foregoing options within the time allowed by the policy, which shall not, in any event, be a period of less than thirty-one days after the dividend apportioned thereto is payable, the effective option shall be that stated in the policy.\n\n5. In case of any extended term or reduced paid-up insurance, the dividends so apportioned, if any, shall be applicable as provided in the policy with the approval of the director of the department of commerce and insurance. In the case of an individual participating term policy issued on or after the first day of January, 1946, the dividend so apportioned shall, at the option of the policyholder, be paid or applied pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4, or, if the policy so provides, pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4. In the case of every individual participating annuity or pure endowment contract the dividend so apportioned shall be applicable, at the election of the holder of such contract, in accordance with the options specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4, or, if the contract so provides, paragraph (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4, if such option is applicable to the type of contract in question. In the case of every individual participating accident or health insurance policy, the dividend so apportioned shall be applicable in accordance with the option specified in paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4. In the case of any participating group insurance policy or of any participating group annuity contract, the dividend so apportioned shall, at the option of the policyholder or holder of the master contract, be applied pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4 above. In the case of participating industrial life insurance policies, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4 shall not be applicable, but the dividends apportioned on such policies shall be distributed annually in such manner as may be determined by the company with the approval of the director of the department of commerce and insurance.\n\n6. No stock or stock and mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of this state shall issue, on or after January 1, 1946, any participating policy or contract which does not by its terms give the right to participate in the divisible surplus earnings of such company as provided herein. No mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of this state shall issue, on or after January 1, 1946, any policy or contract, except as herein provided, which does not by its terms give the right to participate in the divisible surplus earnings of such company as provided herein.\n\n7. Both participating and nonparticipating policies or contracts may provide that in addition to any rate of interest guaranteed by the issuing company to be paid on deferred payments of the proceeds thereof, additional interest may be paid thereon at such rate as the company may annually declare; and the inclusion of such provision in any nonparticipating policy shall not be deemed to make the policy participating. With this exception, the inclusion in any policy or contract of any provision to the effect that the owner thereof shall participate in the surplus of the company issuing such policy or contract, shall be deemed to make such policy or contract a participating one, except, that nonparticipating policies, which provide that they may be exchanged for or converted to paid-up participating policies after the completion of premium payments of a given term of years, shall not be deemed to be participating policies until participation begins according to the terms of the policy.\n\n8. This section shall not be deemed to require the apportionment or distribution of dividends on any immediate annuity contract, nor on any deferred annuity contract for the period following the period of deferment of annuity payments, in accordance with the provisions of such contract, nor on any policy of accident or health insurance, nor on extended term insurance, or pure endowment or reduced paid-up life or endowment insurance which take effect in the event of default in the payment of a premium on any policy or contract, nor on any paid-up additions purchased by dividends, nor on any contract or agreement of reinsurance.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5830, A.L. 1945 p. 1001)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5719; 1919 § 6130; 1909 § 6924",

The legal minimum standard for valuation of policies and contracts and the reserves to be maintained thereon shall be as follows:\n\n(1) For those policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date provided in subsection 20 of section 376.670:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the legal minimum standard for valuation of policies of life insurance or annuity contracts issued prior to April 13, 1934, shall be the Actuaries' or Combined Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at the rate of five percent per annum for group annuity contracts and four percent per annum for all other policies and contracts; and for policies of life insurance and annuity contracts issued on and after April 13, 1934, such minimum standard shall be the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest at the rate of five percent per annum for group annuity contracts and three and one-half percent per annum for all other policies and contracts;\n\n(b) The director may vary the legal minimum standards of interest and mortality for annuity contracts and in particular cases of invalid or substandard lives and other extra hazards, and shall have the right and authority to designate the legal minimum standard for valuation of total and permanent disability benefits and additional accidental death benefits;\n\n(c) Policies issued by companies doing business in this state may provide for not more than one year preliminary term insurance by incorporating in the provisions thereof, specifying the premium consideration to be received, a clause plainly showing that the first year's insurance under such policies is term insurance, purchased by the whole or a part of the premium to be received during the first policy year and shall be valued accordingly; provided, that if the premium charged for term insurance under a limited payment life preliminary term policy providing for the payment of all premiums thereon in less than twenty years from the date of the policy, or under an endowment preliminary term policy, exceeds that charged for life insurance twenty payment life preliminary term policies of the same company, the reserve thereon at the end of any year, including the first, shall not be less than the reserve on a twenty payment life preliminary term policy issued in the same year and at the same age, together with an amount which shall be equivalent to the accumulation of a net level premium sufficient to provide for a pure endowment at the end of the premium payment period equal to the difference between the value at the end of such period of such twenty payment life preliminary term policy and the full reserve at such time of such a limited payment life or endowment policy. The premium payment period is the period during which premiums are concurrently payable under such twenty payment life preliminary term policy and such limited payment life or endowment policy;\n\n(d) Reserves for all such policies and contracts may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by this subdivision. In the case of policy obligations of an insolvent life insurance company assumed or reinsured in bulk by an insurance company upon a basis requiring a separate accounting of the business and assets of such insolvent company and an application of any part of the earnings therefrom upon obligations which are not implicit in the original terms of the policies or contracts assumed or reinsured, the director, in order to protect all policyholders of the reinsuring company, including the holders of all policies so assumed or reinsured, and to safeguard the future solvency of such reinsuring company, shall have the right and authority to designate standards of valuation for such reinsured policies and contracts which will produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by this subdivision or the terms and provisions of the policies and contracts so assumed or reinsured, and, in such event, such reinsuring company shall not, thereafter, adopt any lower standards of valuation without the approval of the director.\n\n(2) For those policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date provided in subsection 20 of section 376.670:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection and subsection 2 of this section, the minimum standard for the valuation of all such policies and contracts shall be the commissioners reserve valuation methods defined in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of this subdivision, three and one-half percent interest on all such policies and contracts except those contracts specified in subparagraph c. of this paragraph which consist of single premium annuity contracts and in subparagraph d. of this paragraph which consists of group annuity contracts where the interest rate shall be five percent, and except policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, issued on or after September 28, 1975, where the interest rate shall be four percent interest for such policies issued prior to September 28, 1979, and four and one-half percent interest for such policies issued on or after September 28, 1979, and the following tables:\n\na. For all ordinary policies of life insurance issued prior to the operative date provided in subsection 12 of section 376.670 on the standard basis, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such policies, the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, and for such policies issued on or after the operative date provided in subsection 12 of section 376.670, and prior to the operative date of subsection 14 of section 376.670, the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; provided that for any category of such policies issued on or after September 28, 1979, on female risks all modified net premiums and present values referred to in this section may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured; and for such policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of section 376.670:\n\n(i) The Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; or\n\n(ii) At the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; or\n\n(iii) Any ordinary mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such policies;\n\nb. For all industrial life insurance policies issued on the standard basis, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such policies, the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table for such policies issued prior to the operative date of subsection 13 of section 376.670 and for such policies issued on or after such operative date, the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or any industrial mortality table, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such policies;\n\nc. For individual annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such policies, the 1937 Standard Annuity Mortality Table or, at the option of the company, the Annuity Mortality Table for 1949, Ultimate, or any modification of either of these tables approved by the director;\n\nd. For group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such policies, the Group Annuity Mortality Table for 1951, any modification of such table approved by the director, or, at the option of the company, any of the tables or modifications of tables specified for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts;\n\ne. For total and permanent disability benefits in or supplementary to ordinary policies or contracts, for policies or contracts issued on or after January 1, 1966, the tables of period two disablement rates and the 1930 to 1950 termination rates of the 1952 disability study of the Society of Actuaries, with due regard to the type of benefit or any tables of disablement rates and termination rates, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such policies; for policies or contracts issued on or after January 1, 1961, and prior to January 1, 1966, either such tables or at the option of the company, the Class (3) Disability Table (1926); and for policies issued prior to January 1, 1961, the Class (3) Disability Table (1926). Any such table shall, for active lives, be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance policies;\n\nf. For accidental death benefits in or supplementary to policies issued on or after January 1, 1966, the 1959 Accidental Death Benefits Table or any accidental death benefits table, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such policies; for policies issued on or after January 1, 1961, and prior to January 1, 1966, either such table or, at the option of the company, the Inter-Company Double Indemnity Mortality Table; and for policies issued prior to January 1, 1961, the Inter-Company Double Indemnity Mortality Table. Either table shall be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance policies;\n\ng. For group life insurance, life insurance issued on the substandard basis and other special benefits, such tables as may be approved by the director;\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d), (e), and (h) of this subdivision, reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of such future guaranteed benefits provided for by such policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of a. over b., as follows:\n\na. A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that such net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy;\n\nb. A net one year term premium for such benefit provided for in the first policy year; provided, that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) of this subdivision, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, but with:\n\n(i) The value defined in subparagraph a. of paragraph (b) of this subdivision being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of such excess first year premium;\n\n(ii) All present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date;\n\n(iii) The policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment; and\n\n(iv) The cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit.\n\n­­In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and subsection 2 of this section shall be used;\n\n(c) Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for:\n\na. Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;\n\nb. Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;\n\nc. Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and\n\nd. All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of paragraph (b) of this subdivision;\n\n(d) Paragraph (e) of this subdivision shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship), or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;\n\n(e) Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values;\n\n(f) In no event shall a company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the method set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (h) and (i) of this subdivision and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for such policies;\n\n(g) In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsections 4 and 5 of this section;\n\n(h) If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for such policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section are those standards stated in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and subsection 2 of this section; provided, that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subdivision and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this paragraph;\n\n(i) In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in paragraphs (b) to (e) of this subdivision, and paragraph (h) of this subdivision, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:\n\na. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and\n\nb. Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this section as determined by regulations promulgated by the director.\n\n(3) Except as provided in subsection 2 of this section, the minimum standard for the valuation of all individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued on or after the operative date of this subdivision, as defined herein, and for all annuities and pure endowments purchased on or after such operative date under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be the commissioners reserve valuation methods defined in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, and the following tables and interest rates:\n\n(a) For individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued prior to September 28, 1979, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table, or any modification of this table approved by the director, and six percent interest for single premium immediate annuity contracts, and four percent interest for all other individual annuity and pure endowment contracts;\n\n(b) For individual single premium immediate annuity contracts issued on or after September 28, 1979, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table, or any individual annuity mortality table adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and seven and one-half percent interest;\n\n(c) For individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued on or after September 28, 1979, other than single premium immediate annuity contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table, or any individual annuity mortality table adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such contracts, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and five and one-half percent interest for single premium deferred annuity and pure endowment contracts and four and one-half percent interest for all other such individual annuity and pure endowment contracts;\n\n(d) For all annuities and pure endowments purchased prior to September 28, 1979, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits purchased under such contracts, the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, or any modification of this table approved by the director, and six percent interest;\n\n(e) For all annuities and pure endowments purchased on or after September 28, 1979, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits purchased under such contracts, the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, or any group annuity mortality table adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that is approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum standard of valuation for such annuities and pure endowments, or any modification of these tables approved by the director, and seven and one-half percent interest;\n\n(f) On and after September 28, 1975, any company may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subdivision after a specified date before January 1, 1980, which shall be the operative date of this subdivision for such company, provided a company may elect a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from that elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this subdivision for such company shall be January 1, 1980.\n\n2. (1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this subsection shall be the interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of:\n\n(a) All life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of section 376.670;\n\n(b) All individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983;\n\n(c) All annuities and pure endowment contracts purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and\n\n(d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.\n\n(2) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent:\n\n(a) For life insurance:\n\nI =.03 + W (R1-.03) + W/2 (R2-.09);\n\nI =.03 + W (R1-.03) + W/2 (R2-.09);\n\n(b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:\n\nI =.03 + W (R -.03), where R1is the lesser of R and .09; R2is the greater of R and .09; R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection; and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection;\n\nI =.03 + W (R -.03), where R1is the lesser of R and .09; R2is the greater of R and .09; R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection; and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection;\n\n(c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, the formula for life insurance stated in paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations of ten years or less;\n\n(d) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall apply;\n\n(e) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall apply. If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when subsection 14 of section 376.670 becomes operative.\n\n(3) The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated in subdivision (2) of this subsection are given in the following tables:\n\n(a) Weighting factors for life insurance:\n\n­­For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy;\n\n(b) Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80;\n\n(c) Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, shall be as specified in subparagraphs a., b., and c. of this paragraph, according to the rules and definitions in subparagraphs d., e., and f. of this paragraph:\n\na. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:\n\nb. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in subparagraph a. of this paragraph increased by:\n\nc. For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis (other than those with no cash settlement options) which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than twelve months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in subparagraph a. of this paragraph or derived in subparagraph b. of this paragraph increased by:\n\nd. For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence;\n\ne. Plan type as used in subparagraphs a., b., and c. of this paragraph is defined as follows:\n\nPlan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or as an immediate life annuity, or no withdrawal permitted;\n\nPlan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or as an immediate life annuity, or no withdrawal permitted;\n\nPlan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over fewer than five years;\n\nPlan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over fewer than five years;\n\nPlan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over fewer than five years either without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund;\n\nPlan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over fewer than five years either without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund;\n\nf. A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.\n\n(4) The\"reference interest rate\"referred to in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be defined as follows:\n\n(a) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;\n\n(b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;\n\n(c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;\n\n(d) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;\n\n(e) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;\n\n(f) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June thirtieth of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n\n(5) In the event that the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the NAIC determines that the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the NAIC and approved by regulation promulgated by the director, may be substituted.\n\n3. For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under subsection 2 of section 376.370.

On or after January 1, 2002, the director of the department of commerce and insurance shall monitor health carrier compliance with the provisions of this section and section 376.383. Examinations, which may be based upon statistical samplings, to determine compliance may be conducted by the department or the director may contract with a qualified private entity. Compliance shall be defined as properly processing and paying ninety-five percent of all claims received in a given calendar year in accordance with the provisions of this section and section 376.383. The director may assess an administrative penalty in addition to the penalties outlined in section 376.383 of up to twenty-five dollars per claim for the percentage of claims found to be in noncompliance, but not to exceed an annual aggregate penalty of two hundred fifty thousand dollars, for any health carrier deemed to be not in*compliance with this section and section 376.383. Any penalty assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be assessed in addition to penalties provided for pursuant to sections 375.942 and 375.1012.\n\n4. If the director finds that health carriers are failing to make interest payments to health care professionals authorized by section 376.383, the director is authorized to order such health carriers to remit such interest payments. The director is also authorized to assess a monetary penalty, payable to the state of Missouri, in a sum not to exceed twenty-five percent of the unpaid interest payment against health carriers.\n\n5. A health carrier may request a waiver of the requirements of this section and section 376.383 if the basis for the request is an act of God or other good cause as determined by the director.\n\n6. The director shall develop a method by which health care providers may submit complaints to the department identifying violations of this section and section 376.383 by a health carrier. The director shall consider such complaints when determining whether to examine a health carrier's compliance. Prior to filing a complaint with the department, health care providers who believe that a health carrier has not paid a claim in accordance with this section and section 376.383 shall first contact the health carrier to determine the status of the claim to ensure that sufficient documentation supporting the claim has been provided and to determine whether the claim is considered to be complete.

The department shall have authority to promulgate rules for the implementation of section 376.383 and this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and if applicable, sections 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 328 & 88)\n\nEffective 1-01-02\n\n*Word \"it\" appears in original rolls.",

A maximum payment for each unrelated injury or sickness, equal to the smaller of the maximum benefit provided under the group policy or two hundred fifty thousand dollars;\n\n(b) Payment of benefits at the rate of eighty percent of covered medical expenses which are in excess of the deductible, until twenty percent of such expenses in a benefit period reaches one thousand dollars, after which benefits will be paid at the rate of one hundred percent during the remainder of such benefit period. Payment of benefits for outpatient treatment of mental illness, if provided in the converted policy, may be at a lesser rate, but not less than fifty percent;\n\n(c) A deductible for each benefit period which, at the option of the insurer, shall be the sum of the benefits deductible plus one hundred dollars, or the corresponding deductible in the group policy. The term\"benefits deductible\", as used herein, means the value of any benefits provided on an expense incurred basis which are provided with respect to covered medical expenses by any other group or individual hospital, surgical or medical insurance policy or medical practice or other prepayment plan, or any other plan or program, whether insured or uninsured, or by reason of any state or federal law and if, pursuant to subdivision (11) herein, the converted policy provides both basic hospital or surgical coverage and major medical coverage, the value of such basic benefits. If the maximum benefit is determined under subparagraph b of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the insurer may require that the deductible be satisfied during a period of not less than three months if the deductible is one hundred dollars or less, and not less than six months if the deductible exceeds one hundred dollars;\n\n(d) The benefit period shall be each calendar year when the maximum benefit is determined under subparagraph a of paragraph (a) of this subdivision or twenty-four months when the maximum benefit is determined under subparagraph b of paragraph (a) of this subdivision;\n\n(e) The term\"covered medical expenses\", as used in this subdivision, shall include at least, in the case of hospital room and board charges, the lesser of the dollar amount set out in plan A under subdivision (9) and the average semiprivate room and board rate for the hospital in which the individual is confined, and at least twice such amount for charges in an intensive care unit. Any surgical procedures schedule shall be consistent with those customarily offered by the insurer under group or individual health insurance policies and must provide at least a one thousand two hundred dollar maximum benefit;\n\n(11) At the option of the insurer, benefit plans set forth in subdivisions (9) and (10) of this section may be provided under one policy or, in lieu of the benefit plans set forth in subdivisions (9) and (10) of this section, the insurer may provide a policy for comprehensive medical expense benefits without first dollar coverage. Such policy shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (10) of this section; provided, however, that an insurer electing to provide such a policy shall make available a low deductible option, not to exceed one hundred dollars, a high deductible option between five hundred dollars and one thousand dollars, and a third deductible option midway between the high and low deductible options. Alternatively, such a policy may provide for deductible options equal to the greater of the benefits deductible and the amount specified in the preceding sentence.\n\n2. (1) The insurer may, at its option, offer alternative plans for converted policies from group policies in addition to those required by sections 376.395 to 376.404. Furthermore, if any insurer customarily offers individual policies on a service basis, that insurer may, in lieu of converted policies on an expense incurred basis, make available converted policies on a service basis which, in the opinion of the director of the department of commerce and insurance, satisfy the intent of sections 376.395 to 376.404.\n\n(2) Nothing in sections 376.395 to 376.404 shall preclude a health service corporation from limiting its conversion offerings to one of the plans offered by the insurer that is consistent with group policies customarily offered by the health service corporation. The employee or member under the group insurance policy from which conversion is made shall be entitled to obtain one such converted policy.\n\n3. Notification of the conversion privilege shall be included in each certificate of coverage.\n\n4. All converted policies shall become effective on the day immediately following the date of termination of insurance under a group policy.\n\n(L. 1981 S.B. 58 § 2)\n\nEffective 1-01-83",

Proof of such incapacity and dependency must be furnished to the insurer by the certificate holder at least thirty-one days after the child's attainment of the limiting age.

Health benefit plans may limit coverage for the routine patient care costs of patients in phase II of a clinical trial to those treating facilities within the health benefit plans' provider network; except that, this provision shall not be construed as relieving a health benefit plan of the sufficiency of network requirements under state statute.\n\n2. In the case of treatment under a clinical trial, the treating facility and personnel must have the expertise and training to provide the treatment and treat a sufficient volume of patients. There must be equal to or superior, noninvestigational treatment alternatives and the available clinical or preclinical data must provide a reasonable expectation that the treatment will be superior to the noninvestigational alternatives.\n\n3.

An entity seeking coverage for treatment, prevention, or early detection in a clinical trial approved by an institutional review board under subdivision (5) of subsection 4 of this section shall maintain and post electronically a list of the clinical trials meeting the requirements of subsections 2 and 3 of this section. This list shall include: the phase for which the clinical trial is approved; the entity approving the trial; the particular disease; and the number of participants in the trial.

Such documents shall be made available to the health insurer upon request.\n\n9. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a policy, plan or contract paid under Title XVIII or Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\n\n10. Nothing in this section shall apply to any accident-only policy, specified disease policy, hospital indemnity policy, Medicare supplement policy, long-term care policy, short-term major medical policy of six months or less duration, or other limited benefit health insurance policies.\n\n11.

(1) For health benefit plans that are not grandfathered health benefit plans or excepted health benefit plans, a health carrier may use rates on the earliest of:\n\n(a) The date the director determines the rates are reasonable;\n\n(b) The date the health carrier notifies the director of its intent to use rates that the director has deemed unreasonable; or\n\n(c) Sixty days after the date of filing rates with the director.\n\n(2) The director may notify the health carrier within sixty days of the date of filing rates with the director that the health carrier has failed to provide sufficient rate filing documentation to review the proposed rates. The health carrier may, as described in this section, provide additional information to support the rate filing.\n\n8. For health benefit plans described under subsection 7 of this section, all proposed rates and rate filing documentation shall be submitted in the form and content prescribed by rule, which is consistent with the requirements of 45 CFR 154, and shall include review standards and criteria consistent with 45 CFR 154.\n\n9.

Rate filing documentation and other supporting information that is a trade secret or of a proprietary nature, and has been designated as such by the health carrier, shall not be considered a public record.\n\n10. For rates filed for health benefit plans described under subsection 7 of this section, the director shall:\n\n(1) Provide a means by which the public can submit written comments concerning proposed rate increases;\n\n(2) Review proposed rates and rate filing documentation;\n\n(3) Determine that a proposed rate is an unreasonable rate if the increase is an excessive rate, an inadequate rate, an unfairly discriminatory rate, or an unjustified rate, consistent with 45 CFR 154; and\n\n(4) Within sixty days after submission, provide a written notice to the health carrier detailing whether the proposed rates are reasonable or unreasonable. For proposed rates deemed unreasonable, the written notice shall specify deficiencies and provide detailed reasons for the director's decision that the proposed rate is excessive, inadequate, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory.\n\n11. Within thirty days after receiving written notice of the director's determination that the proposed rates are unreasonable, as described under subsection 10 of this section, a health carrier may amend its rates, request reconsideration based upon additional information, or implement the proposed rates. The health carrier shall notify the director of its intention no later than thirty days after its receipt of the written notice of the determination of unreasonable rates.\n\n12. If a health carrier implements a rate that the director has determined is unreasonable under subsection 10 of this section, the department shall make such determination public, in a form and manner determined by rule.\n\n13. For health benefit plans described under subsection 7 of this section, the director shall publish final rates on the department's website no earlier than thirty days prior to the first day of the annual open enrollment period in the individual market for the applicable calendar year. The final rate is the rate that will be implemented by the health carrier on a specified date.\n\n14. Time frames described under this section may be extended upon mutual agreement between the director and the health carrier.\n\n15. The director may promulgate rules to promote health insurance rate transparency including, but not limited to, prescribing the form and content of the information required to be submitted and of the standards of review that are consistent with 45 CFR 154. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2016, shall be invalid and void.\n\n16. This section shall apply to health benefit plans that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2018. In order to ensure that health benefit plans comply with the provisions of this section, the director shall promulgate rules regarding the initial implementation of the provisions of this section. Such rules shall be effective no later than March 1, 2017, and, for health benefit plans described under subsection 7 of this section, shall include, but not be limited to, the form and content of the information required to be submitted and of the standards of review, consistent with 45 CFR 154.\n\n(L. 2016 S.B. 865 & 866)",

Annuity contract requirements — paid-up annuity benefits, how calculated — cash surrender benefits, how calculated — applicable, when. —1. This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan, or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the company issuing the contract.\n\n2. In the case of contracts issued on or after the effective date of this section as defined in subsection 11 of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection 1 of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:\n\n(1) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, or upon the written request of the contract owner, the company shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of this section;\n\n(2) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company shall pay in lieu of a paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in subsections 4, 5, 7, and 9 of this section. The company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract after making written request and receiving written approval of the director. The request shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral;\n\n(3) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of the benefits; and\n\n(4) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.­­Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, a deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from prior considerations paid would be less than twenty dollars monthly, the company may at its option terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis on the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.\n\n­­Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, a deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from prior considerations paid would be less than twenty dollars monthly, the company may at its option terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis on the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.\n\n3. The minimum values as specified in subsections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section.\n\n(1) The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection of the net considerations (as hereinafter defined) paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of paragraphs (a) to (d) below:\n\n(a) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection; and\n\n(b) An annual contract charge of fifty dollars, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection;\n\n(c) Any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection; and\n\n(d) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.\n\n(2) The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount equal to eighty-seven and one-half percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.\n\n(3) The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:\n\n(a) The five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than fifteen months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under paragraph (d) of this subdivision;\n\n(b) Reduced by one hundred twenty-five basis points;\n\n(c) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent; and\n\n(d) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date.\n\n(4) During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in paragraph (b) of subdivision (3) of this subsection by up to an additional one hundred basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the director, the director may disallow or limit the additional reduction.\n\n(5) The director may adopt rules to implement the provisions of subdivision (4) of this subsection and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts that the director determines adjustments are justified.\n\n4. Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. Present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rates specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.\n\n5. For contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit that would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.\n\n6. For contracts that do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value, and increased by any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. For contracts that do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.\n\n7. For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections 5 and 6 of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.\n\n8. A contract that does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.\n\n9. Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.\n\n10. For a contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of this section, additional benefits payable in the event of total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment, and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender, and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender, and death benefits.\n\n11. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 376.671, after the effective date of this section*, a company may elect to apply the provisions of this section in lieu of section 376.671 to annuity contracts on a contract form-by-contract form basis before July 1, 2006. In all other instances, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts issued by the company after July 1, 2006.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 938 merged with S.B. 1188)\n\n*Effective 6-21-04 (S.B. 1188); 8-28-04 (H.B. 938)",

In the case of policies issued on or after the operative date of this section, as defined in subsection 20 of this section, no policy of life insurance, except as stated in subsection 19 of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director of the department of commerce and insurance are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section and are essentially in compliance with subsection 18 of this section:\n\n(1) That, in the event of default in any premium payment, the company will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be herein specified. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the company may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits;\n\n(2) That, upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be herein specified;\n\n(3) That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default;\n\n(4) That, if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be herein specified;\n\n(5) In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy;\n\n(6) A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the company on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.\n\n3. Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.\n\n4. The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.\n\n5. (1) Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection 2 of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy if there had been no default, including any existing paid-up additions, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of this section corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.\n\n(2) For any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of this section which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.\n\n(3) For any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of this section which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age seventy-one, the cash surrender value referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.\n\n(4) Any cash surrender value available within thirty days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by subsection 2 of this section, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the company on the policy.\n\n6. Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.\n\n7. This subsection and subsections 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of this section. Except as provided in subsection 10 of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:\n\n(1) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;\n\n(2) Two percent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as herein defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;\n\n(3) Forty percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;\n\n(4) Twenty-five percent of either the adjusted premiums for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.\n\n8. Provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection 7 of this section, no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n9. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy; provided, however, that in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by such policy at age ten.\n\n10. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (a) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (b) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, the foregoing items (a) and (b) being calculated separately and as specified in subsections 7, 8, and 9 of this section except that, for the purposes of subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of subsection 7 of this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in (b) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in (a).\n\n11. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 12 and 13 of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on and after the effective date of this amendment on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits; provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred*thirty percent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table; provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the director.\n\n12. This subsection shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of this section. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date provided in this subsection, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 28, 1975, and prior to September 28, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 28, 1979, and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured; provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table; provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the director. After the date when this subsection becomes effective, any company may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such company, this subsection shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such company shall be January 1, 1966.\n\n13. This subsection shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection 14 of this section. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 28, 1975, and prior to September 28, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 28, 1979; provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table; provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the director. After the date when this subsection becomes effective, any company may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such company, this subsection shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such company shall be January 1, 1968.\n\n14. (1) This subsection shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this subsection as defined herein. Except as provided in subdivision (7) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:\n\n(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than four percent;\n\n(b) One percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and\n\n(c) One hundred twenty-five percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined. In applying the percentage specified in paragraph (c) above, no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n(2) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.\n\n(3) In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (7) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (a) the sum of the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and the additional expense allowance, if any, over (b) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.\n\n(5) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:\n\n(a) One percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and\n\n(b) One hundred twenty-five percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n(6) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (a) by (b) where:\n\n(a) Equals the sum of:\n\na. The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and\n\nb. The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and\n\n(b) Equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that in each policy year such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\n(8) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or, at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection for policies issued in that calendar year.\n\n(9) Except as provided in subdivision (8) of this subsection:\n\n(a) At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;\n\n(b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection 2 of this section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;\n\n(c) A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;\n\n(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;\n\n(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables listed in paragraph (d) of this subdivision;\n\n(f) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table;\n\n(g) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the director approves by regulation any ordinary mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, such minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual;\n\n(h) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the NAIC, that are approved by regulation promulgated by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or for the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table;\n\n(i) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the director approves by regulation any industrial mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, such minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(10) Thenonforfeiture interest rateis defined as follows:\n\n(a) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in section 376.380 rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent;\n\n(b) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.\n\n(12) After the effective date of this subsection, any company may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such company shall be January 1, 1989.\n\n15. In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections 1 to 14 of this section, then:\n\n(1) The director must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections 1 to 14 of this section;\n\n(2) The director must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;\n\n(3) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this section, as determined by regulations promulgated by the director.\n\n16. Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions.\n\n17. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 5 of this section, additional benefits payable:\n\n(1) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;\n\n(2) In the event of total and permanent disability;\n\n(3) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;\n\n(4) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;\n\n(5) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and\n\n(6) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits; shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n18. (1) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.\n\n(2) The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in subdivision (3) of this subsection, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary. The effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection 5 of this section or in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection 5 of this section or in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section, whichever is applicable on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.\n\n(3) The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section or in subsection 14 of this section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by subdivision (4) of this subsection, such percentage:\n\n(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of the fifth policy anniversary or the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and\n\n(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in paragraph (a) of this subdivision may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years. No basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this section or in subsection 14 of this section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.\n\n(4) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.\n\n(5) Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections 4, 5, 6, 14, and 16 of this section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as subdivisions (1) to (6) in subsection 17 shall conform with the principles of this subsection.\n\n19. (1) This section shall not apply to any of the following:\n\n(a) Reinsurance;\n\n(b) Group insurance;\n\n(c) Pure endowments;\n\n(d) Annuities or reversionary annuity contracts;\n\n(e) Term policies of uniform amounts, which provide no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewals thereof of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;\n\n(f) Term policies of decreasing amounts, which provide no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium calculated as specified in subsections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of this section is less than the adjusted premium so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance, and for a term of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;\n\n(g) Policies, which provide no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections 5 to 14 of this section, exceeds two and one-half percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year;\n\n(h) Policies which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the company issuing the policies.\n\n(2) For purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the expiration date for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.\n\n20.

(1) Health care professionals shall send any claim for charges incurred for unanticipated out-of-network care to the patient's health carrier within one hundred eighty days of the delivery of the unanticipated out-of-network care on a U.S. Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services Form 1500, or its successor form, or electronically using the 837 HIPAA format, or its successor.\n\n(2) Within forty-five processing days, as defined in section 376.383, of receiving the health care professional's claim, the health carrier shall offer to pay the health care professional a reasonable reimbursement for unanticipated out-of-network care based on the health care professional's services. If the health care professional participates in one or more of the carrier's commercial networks, the offer of reimbursement for unanticipated out-of-network care shall be the amount from the network which has the highest reimbursement.\n\n(3) If the health care professional declines the health carrier's initial offer of reimbursement, the health carrier and health care professional shall have sixty days from the date of the initial offer of reimbursement to negotiate in good faith to attempt to determine the reimbursement for the unanticipated out-of-network care.\n\n(4) If the health carrier and health care professional do not agree to a reimbursement amount by the end of the sixty-day negotiation period, the dispute shall be resolved through an arbitration process as specified in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n(5) To initiate arbitration proceedings, either the health carrier or health care professional must provide written notification to the director and the other party within one hundred twenty days of the end of the negotiation period, indicating their intent to arbitrate the matter and notifying the director of the billed amount and the date and amount of the final offer by each party. A claim for unanticipated out-of-network care may be resolved between the parties at any point prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings. Claims may be combined for purposes of arbitration, but only to the extent the claims represent similar circumstances and services provided by the same health care professional, and the parties attempted to resolve the dispute in accordance with subdivisions (3) to (5) of this subsection.\n\n(6) No health care professional who sends a claim to a health carrier under subsection 2 of this section shall send a bill to the patient for any difference between the reimbursement rate as determined under this subsection and the health care professional's billed charge.\n\n3. (1) When unanticipated out-of-network care is provided, the health care professional who sends a claim to a health carrier under subsection 2 of this section may bill a patient for no more than the cost-sharing requirements described under this section.\n\n(2) Cost-sharing requirements shall be based on the reimbursement amount as determined under subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(3) The patient's health carrier shall inform the health care professional of its enrollee's cost-sharing requirements within forty-five processing days of receiving a claim from the health care professional for services provided.\n\n(4) The in-network deductible and out-of-pocket maximum cost-sharing requirements shall apply to the claim for the unanticipated out-of-network care.\n\n4. The director shall ensure access to an external arbitration process when a health care professional and health carrier cannot agree to a reimbursement under subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section. In order to ensure access, when notified of a parties' intent to arbitrate, the director shall randomly select an arbitrator for each case from the department's approved list of arbitrators or entities that provide binding arbitration. The director shall specify the criteria for an approved arbitrator or entity by rule. The costs of arbitration shall be shared equally between and will be directly billed to the health care professional and health carrier. These costs will include, but are not limited to, reasonable time necessary for the arbitrator to review materials in preparation for the arbitration, travel expenses and reasonable time following the arbitration for drafting of the final decision.\n\n5. At the conclusion of such arbitration process, the arbitrator shall issue a final decision, which shall be binding on all parties. The arbitrator shall provide a copy of the final decision to the director. The initial request for arbitration, all correspondence and documents received by the department and the final arbitration decision shall be considered a closed record under section 374.071. However, the director may release aggregated summary data regarding the arbitration process. The decision of the arbitrator shall not be considered an agency decision nor shall it be considered a contested case within the meaning of section 536.010.\n\n6. The arbitrator shall determine a dollar amount due under subsection 2 of this section between one hundred twenty percent of the Medicare-allowed amount and the seventieth percentile of the usual and customary rate for the unanticipated out-of-network care, as determined by benchmarks from independent nonprofit organizations that are not affiliated with insurance carriers or provider organizations.\n\n7. When determining a reasonable reimbursement rate, the arbitrator shall consider the following factors if the health care professional believes the payment offered for the unanticipated out-of-network care does not properly recognize:\n\n(1) The health care professional's training, education, or experience;\n\n(2) The nature of the service provided;\n\n(3) The health care professional's usual charge for comparable services provided;\n\n(4) The circumstances and complexity of the particular case, including the time and place the services were provided; and\n\n(5) The average contracted rate for comparable services provided in the same geographic area.\n\n8. The enrollee shall not be required to participate in the arbitration process. The health care professional and health carrier shall execute a nondisclosure agreement prior to engaging in an arbitration under this section.\n\n9. The department of commerce and insurance may promulgate rules and fees as necessary to implement the provisions of this section, including but not limited to procedural requirements for arbitration. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2018, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2018 S.B. 982, A.L. 2019 S.B. 514)",

The continuation shall be on a premium paying basis for a period of six months from the date on which the total disability started, but shall not extend beyond the approval by the insurer of continuation of the coverage under any disability provision which the group insurance policy may contain or the discontinuance of the group insurance policy, whichever occurs earlier;\n\n(12) In the case of a policy insuring the lives of debtors, a provision stating that the insurer will furnish to the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a certificate of insurance describing the coverage and specifying that the death benefit shall first be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1546 § 4)\n\n*Word \"a\" does not appear in original rolls.",

Sections 376.715 to 376.758 shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection 2 of this section:\n\n(1) To persons who, regardless of where they reside, except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts, are the beneficiaries, assignees or payees, including health care providers rendering services covered under health insurance policies or certificates, of the persons covered under subdivision (2) of this subsection; and\n\n(2) To persons who are owners of, certificate holders, or enrollees under such policies or contracts, other than structured settlement annuities, who:\n\n(a) Are residents of this state; or\n\n(b) Are not residents, but only under all of the following conditions:\n\na. The member insurers which issued such policies or contracts are domiciled in this state;\n\nb. The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer or health maintenance organization was not licensed in such state at the time specified in such state's guaranty association law; and\n\nc. The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by sections 376.715 to 376.758;\n\n(3) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection 2 of this section, subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection 1 of this section shall not apply, and sections 376.715 to 376.758 shall, except as provided in subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subsection, provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee:\n\n(a) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or\n\n(b) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions:\n\na. (i) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident; or\n\n(ii) The contract owner of the structure settlement annuity is not a resident, but:\n\ni.

Neither the payee or beneficiary nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides;\n\n(4) Sections 376.715 to 376.758 shall not provide to a person who is a payee or beneficiary of a contract owner resident of this state, if the payee or beneficiary is afforded any coverage by such an association of another state;\n\n(5) Sections 376.715 to 376.758 are intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident.

In determining the application of the provisions of this subdivision in situations where a person could be covered by such an association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, enrollee, beneficiary, or assignee, sections 376.715 to 376.758 shall be construed in conjunction with the other state's laws to result in coverage by only one association.\n\n2. Sections 376.715 to 376.758 shall provide coverage to the persons specified in subsection 1 of this section for policies or contracts of direct, nongroup life insurance, health insurance, which for the purposes of sections 376.715 to 376.758 includes health maintenance organizations' subscriber contracts and certificates, or annuities and supplemental contracts to any such policies or contracts, and for certificates under direct group policies and contracts, except as limited by the provisions of sections 376.715 to 376.758.

Section 1144, as amended;\n\n(b) A minimum premium group insurance plan;\n\n(c) A stop-loss group insurance plan; or\n\n(d) An administrative services only contract;\n\n(5) Any portion of a policy or contract to the extent that it provides dividends or experience rating credits, voting rights, or provides that any fees or allowances be paid to any person, including the policy or contract holder, in connection with the service to or administration of such policy or contract;\n\n(6) Any policy or contract issued in this state by a member insurer at a time when it was not licensed or did not have a certificate of authority to issue such policy or contract in this state;\n\n(7) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the assessments required by section 376.735 with respect to the policy or contract are preempted by federal or state law;\n\n(8) An obligation that does not arise under the express written terms of the policy or contract issued by the member insurer to the enrollee, certificate holder, contract owner, or policy owner, including without limitation:\n\n(a) Claims based on marketing materials;\n\n(b) Claims based on side letters, riders, or other documents that were issued by the member insurer without meeting applicable policy or contract form filing or approval requirements;\n\n(c) Misrepresentations of or regarding policy or contract benefits;\n\n(d) Extra-contractual claims;\n\n(e) A claim for penalties or consequential or incidental damages;\n\n(9) A contractual agreement that establishes the member insurer's obligations to provide a book value accounting guaranty for defined contribution benefit plan participants by reference to a portfolio of assets that is owned by the benefit plan or its trustee, which in each case is not an affiliate of the member insurer;\n\n(10) An unallocated annuity contract;\n\n(11) A portion of a policy or contract to the extent it provides for interest or other changes in value to be determined by the use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract, but which have not been credited to the policy or contract, or as to which the policy or contract owner's rights are subject to forfeiture, as of the date the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under sections 376.715 to 376.758, whichever is earlier. If a policy's or contract's interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, for purposes of determining the value that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subdivision, the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be subject to forfeiture;\n\n(12) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug or other health care benefit under Part C or Part D of Subchapter XVIII, Chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code, Medicare Parts C & D, Subchapter XIX, Chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code, Medicaid, or any regulations issued thereunder.\n\n4. The benefits for which the association may become liable, with regard to a member insurer that was first placed under an order of rehabilitation or under an order of liquidation if no order of rehabilitation was entered prior to August 28, 2013, shall in no event exceed the lesser of:\n\n(1) The contractual obligations for which the member insurer is liable or would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer; or\n\n(2) With respect to any one life, regardless of the number of policies or contracts:\n\n(a) Three hundred thousand dollars in life insurance death benefits, but not more than one hundred thousand dollars in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values for life insurance;\n\n(b) One hundred thousand dollars in health insurance benefits, including any net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values;\n\n(c) One hundred thousand dollars in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values.\n\n­­Provided, however, that in no event shall the association be liable to expend more than three hundred thousand dollars in the aggregate with respect to any one life under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subdivision.\n\n5. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the benefits for which the association may become liable with regard to a member insurer that was first placed under an order of rehabilitation or under an order of liquidation if no order of rehabilitation was entered on or after August 28, 2013, shall in no event exceed the lesser of:\n\n(1) The contractual obligations for which the insurer is liable or would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer; or\n\n(2) (a) With respect to any one life, regardless of the number of policies or contracts:\n\na. Three hundred thousand dollars in life insurance death benefits, but not more than one hundred thousand dollars in net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values for life insurance;\n\nb. For health insurance benefits:\n\n(i) One hundred thousand dollars of coverages other than disability income insurance, health benefit plans, or long-term care insurance, including any net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values;\n\n(ii) Three hundred thousand dollars for disability income insurance and three hundred thousand dollars for long-term care insurance;\n\n(iii) Five hundred thousand dollars for health benefit plans;\n\nc. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values; or\n\n(b) With respect to each payee of a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary or beneficiaries of the payee if deceased, two hundred fifty thousand dollars in present value annuity benefits, in the aggregate, including net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values, if any;\n\n(c) Except that, in no event shall the association be obligated to cover more than:\n\na. An aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars in benefits with respect to any one life under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision, except with respect to benefits for health benefit plans under item (iii) of subparagraph b. of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, in which case the aggregate liability of the association shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars with respect to any one individual; or\n\nb. With respect to one owner of multiple nongroup policies of life insurance, whether the policy owner is an individual, firm, corporation, or other person, and whether the persons insured are officers, managers, employees, or other persons, more than five million dollars in benefits, regardless of the number of policies and contracts held by the owner.\n\n6. The limitations set forth in subsections 4 and 5 of this section are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account either its subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to which such benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies. The costs of the association's obligations under sections 376.715 to 376.758 may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association under its subrogation and assignment rights.\n\n7. For the purposes of sections 376.715 to 376.758, benefits provided by a long-term care rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract shall be considered the same type of benefits as the basic life insurance policy or annuity contract to which it relates.\n\n(L. 1988 S.B. 430 § 3, A.L. 2010 S.B. 583, A.L. 2013 S.B. 59, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1690)",

Hospital and medical expense provisions extended for certain handicapped and dependent children past normal coverage age. —1. This section applies to the hospital and medical expense provisions of an accident or sickness insurance policy.\n\n2. If a policy provides that coverage of a dependent child terminates upon attainment of the limiting age for dependent children specified in the policy, such policy so long as it remains in force shall be deemed to provide that attainment of such limiting age does not operate to terminate the hospital and medical coverage of such child while the child is and continues to be both incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental or physical handicap and chiefly dependent upon the policyholder for support and maintenance. Proof of such incapacity and dependency must be furnished to the insurer by the policyholder at least thirty-one days after the child's attainment of the limiting age. The insurer may require at reasonable intervals during the two years following the child's attainment of the limiting age subsequent proof of the child's disability and dependency. After such two-year period, the insurer may require subsequent proof not more than once each year.\n\n3. If a policy provides that coverage of a dependent child terminates upon attainment of the limiting age for dependent children specified in the policy, such policy, so long as it remains in force until the dependent child attains the limiting age, shall remain in force at the option of the policyholder. The policyholder's election for continued coverage under this section shall be furnished by the policyholder to the insurer within thirty-one days after the child's attainment of the limiting age. As used in this subsection, a dependent child is a person who:\n\n(1) Is a resident of this state;\n\n(2) Is unmarried and no more than twenty-five years of age; and\n\n(3) Not provided coverage as a named subscriber, insured, enrollee, or covered person under any group or individual health benefit plan, or entitled to benefits under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, P.L. 89-97, 42 U.S.C.

Except as provided in subsection 3 of this section each such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain the provisions specified in this subsection in the words in which the same appear in this section; provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, substitute for one or more of such provisions corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance which are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Such provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing in this subsection or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the director of the department of commerce and insurance may approve.\n\n(1) A provision as follows: \"ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES:\n\nThis policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions\".\n\n(When under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 376.775 the effective and termination dates are stated in the premium receipt, the insurer shall insert in the first sentence of the foregoing policy provision immediately following the comma after the word \"any\", the following words: \"and the insurer's official premium receipt when executed\").\n\n(2) A provision as follows: \"TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES:\n\n(a) After two years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such two-year period\".\n\n(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirements for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such initial two-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of subsection 2 of this section in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance.)\n\n(A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least age fifty or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption \"UNCONTESTABLE\":­­\"After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become uncontestable as to the statements contained in the application).\n\n­­\"After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become uncontestable as to the statements contained in the application).\n\n(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after two years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.\"\n\n(3) A provision as follows: \"GRACE PERIOD:\n\nA grace period of ______ (insert a number not less than \"7\" for weekly premium policies, \"10\" for monthly premium policies and \"31\" for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.\"\n\n(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of the above provision, subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision hereof.

The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement\".\n\n(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age fifty or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue.)\n\n(5) A provision as follows: \"NOTICE OF CLAIM:\n\nWritten notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible.

The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.

The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given\").\n\n(6) A provision as follows: \"CLAIM FORMS:\n\nThe insurer upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.­­If such forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made\".\n\n­­If such forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made\".\n\n(7) A provision as follows: \"PROOFS OF LOSS:\n\nWritten proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required\".\n\n(8) A provision as follows: \"TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS:\n\nIndemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid ______ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof\".\n\n(9) A provision as follows: \"PAYMENT OF CLAIMS:\n\nIndemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment. If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the insured\".\n\n(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:­­\"If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $______ (insert an amount which shall not exceed one thousand dollars), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.

Other provisions. Except as provided in subsection 3 of this section, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section; provided, however, that the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this subsection or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the director of the department of commerce and insurance may approve.\n\n(1) A provision as follows: \"CHANGE OF OCCUPATION:\n\nIf the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation\".\n\n(2) A provision as follows: \"MISSTATEMENT OF AGE:\n\nIf the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age\".\n\n(3) A provision as follows: \"OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER:\n\nIf an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ______ (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $______ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate, or in lieu thereof.­­Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies\".\n\n­­Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies\".\n\n(4) A provision as follows: \"INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:\n\nIf there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the \"like amount\" of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage\".\n\n(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase \"EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS\". The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"other valid coverage\", approved as to form by the director of the department of commerce and insurance, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employees benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be \"other valid coverage\" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as \"other valid coverage\").\n\n(5) A provision as follows: \"INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS:\n\nIf there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined\".\n\n(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase \"OTHER BENEFITS\". The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"other valid coverage\", approved as to form by the director of the department of commerce and insurance which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be \"other valid coverage\", of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as \"other valid coverage\").\n\n(6) A provision as follows: \"RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE:\n\nIf the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time\".\n\n(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age fifty or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from this date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"valid loss of time coverage\", approved as to form by the director of the department of commerce and insurance, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director of the department of commerce and insurance or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations).\n\n(7) A provision as follows: \"UNPAID PREMIUM:\n\nUpon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom\".\n\n(8) A provision as follows: \"CANCELLATION:\n\nThe insurer may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation\".\n\n(9) A provision as follows: \"CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes\".\n\n(10) A provision as follows: \"ILLEGAL OCCUPATION:\n\nThe insurer shall not be liable for any loss to which a contributing cause was the insured's commission of or attempt to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured's being engaged in an illegal occupation\".\n\n(11) A provision as follows: \"INTOXICANTS AND NARCOTICS:\n\nThe insurer shall not be liable for any loss sustained or contracted in consequence of the insured's being intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic unless administered on the advice of a physician\".\n\n3. Inapplicable or inconsistent provisions. If any provision of this section is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy the insurer, with the approval of the director of the department of commerce and insurance, shall omit from such policy an inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision, in such manner as to make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy.\n\n4. Order of certain policy provisions. The provisions which are the subject of subsections 1 and 2 of this section, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such subsections, shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such subsections or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered or issued.\n\n5. Third party ownership. The word \"insured\" as used in sections 376.770 to 376.800, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein.\n\n6. Requirements of other jurisdictions.\n\n(1) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state, may contain any provision which is not less favorable to the insured or the beneficiary than the provisions of sections 376.770 to 376.800 and which is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is organized.\n\n(2) Any policy of a domestic insurer may, when issued for delivery in any other state or country, contain any provision permitted or required by the laws of such other state or country.\n\n7.

Such rules and regulations shall provide, among other things, that if a policy form is disapproved, all specific reasons for nonconformance shall be stated in writing within forty-five days from the date of filing; that a hearing shall be granted upon such disapproval, if so requested; and that the failure of the director of the department of commerce and insurance, to take action approving or disapproving a submitted policy form within forty-five days from the date of filing, shall be deemed an approval thereof. If at any time after a policy form is approved or deemed approved, the director determines that any provision of the filing is contrary to state law, the director shall notify the health carrier of the specific provisions that are contrary to state law and any specific statute or regulation to which the provision is contrary, and request that the health carrier file within thirty days of the notification an amendment form that modifies the provision to conform to state law.

Such amendment shall have the force and effect as if the amendment was in the original filing or policy.\n\n(3) The director of the department of commerce and insurance shall approve only those policies which are in compliance with the insurance laws of this state and which contain such words, phraseology, conditions and provisions which are specific, certain and unambiguous and reasonably adequate to meet needed requirements for the protection of those insured. The disapproval of any policy form shall be based upon the requirements of the laws of this state or of any regulation lawfully promulgated thereunder.\n\n(4) The director of the department of commerce and insurance may, by order or bulletin, exempt from the approval requirements of this section for so long as he deems proper any insurance policy, document, or form or type thereof, as specified in such order or bulletin, to which, in his opinion, this section may not practicably be applied, or the approval of which is, in his opinion, not desirable or necessary for the protection of the public.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a health carrier, as defined in section 376.1350, may offer a health benefit plan that is a managed care plan that requires all health care services to be delivered by a participating provider in the health carrier's network, except for emergency services, as defined in section 376.1350, and the services described in subsection 4 of section 376.811. Such a provision shall be disclosed in the policy form.\n\n(L. 1959 H.B. 252 § 4, A.L. 1984 S.B. 592, A.L. 2013 S.B. 262)",

Pool to offer medical coverage — premiums, how established — standard risk rate, how calculated — director to approve rates — exclusions — benefits reduced by other insurance or workers' compensation — medical expense to include prayer for spiritual healing. —1. The pool shall offer major medical expense coverage to every person eligible for coverage under section 376.966. The coverage to be issued by the pool and its schedule of benefits, exclusions and other limitations, shall be established by the board with the advice and recommendations of the pool members, and such plan of pool coverage shall be submitted to the director for approval. The pool shall also offer coverage for drugs and supplies requiring a medical prescription and coverage for patient education services, to be provided at the direction of a physician, encompassing the provision of information, therapy, programs, or other services on an inpatient or outpatient basis, designed to restrict, control, or otherwise cause remission of the covered condition, illness or defect.\n\n2. In establishing the pool coverage the board shall take into consideration the levels of health insurance provided in this state and medical economic factors as may be deemed appropriate, and shall promulgate benefit levels, deductibles, coinsurance factors, exclusions and limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with health insurance provided through a representative number of insurers in this state.\n\n3.

Premium rates and schedules shall be submitted to the director for approval prior to use.\n\n4.

The standard risk rate shall be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and shall reflect anticipated experience and expenses for such coverage. Initial rates for pool coverage shall not be less than one hundred twenty-five percent of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks. Subject to the limits provided in this subsection, subsequent rates shall be established to provide fully for the expected costs of claims including recovery of prior losses, expenses of operation, investment income of claim reserves, and any other cost factors subject to the limitations described herein. In no event shall pool rates exceed the following:\n\n(1) For federally defined eligible individuals and trade act eligible individuals, rates shall be equal to the percent of rates applicable to individual standard risks actuarially determined to be sufficient to recover the sum of the cost of benefits paid under the pool for federally defined and trade act eligible individuals plus the proportion of the pool's administrative expense applicable to federally defined and trade act eligible individuals enrolled for pool coverage, provided that such rates shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent of rates applicable to individual standard risks; and\n\n(2) For all other individuals covered under the pool, one hundred fifty percent of rates applicable to individual standard risks.\n\n5. Pool coverage established pursuant to this section shall provide an appropriate high and low deductible to be selected by the pool applicant. The deductibles and coinsurance factors may be adjusted annually in accordance with the medical component of the consumer price index.\n\n6. Pool coverage shall exclude charges or expenses incurred during the first twelve months following the effective date of coverage as to any condition for which medical advice, care or treatment was recommended or received as to such condition during the six-month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage. Such preexisting condition exclusions shall be waived to the extent to which similar exclusions, if any, have been satisfied under any prior health insurance coverage which was involuntarily terminated, if application for pool coverage is made not later than sixty-three days following such involuntary termination and, in such case, coverage in the pool shall be effective from the date on which such prior coverage was terminated.\n\n7. No preexisting condition exclusion shall be applied to the following:\n\n(1) A federally defined eligible individual who has not experienced a significant gap in coverage; or\n\n(2) A trade act eligible individual who maintained creditable health insurance coverage for an aggregate period of three months prior to loss of employment and who has not experienced a significant gap in coverage since that time.\n\n8.

The insurer or the pool shall have a cause of action against an eligible person for the recovery of the amount of benefits paid which are not for covered expenses. Benefits due from the pool may be reduced or refused as a setoff against any amount recoverable under this subsection.\n\n9.

Any health carrier or health benefit plan that offers or issues health benefit plans, other than Medicaid health benefit plans, which are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2006, shall provide coverage for early intervention services described in this section that are delivered by early intervention specialists who are health care professionals licensed by the state of Missouri and acting within the scope of their professions for children from birth to age three identified by the Part C early intervention system as eligible for services under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1431, et seq. Such coverage shall be limited to three thousand dollars for each covered child per policy per calendar year, with a maximum of nine thousand dollars per child.\n\n2. As used in this section, \"health carrier\" and \"health benefit plan\" shall have the same meaning as such terms are defined in section 376.1350.\n\n3. In the event that any health benefit plan is found not to be required to provide coverage under subsection 1 of this section because of preemption by a federal law, including but not limited to the act commonly known as ERISA contained in Title 29 of the United States Code, or in the event that subsection 1 of this section is found to be unconstitutional, then the lead agency shall be responsible for payment and provision of any benefit provided under this section.\n\n4. For purposes of this section,\"early intervention services\"means medically necessary speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and assistive technology devices for children from birth to age three who are identified by the Part C early intervention system as eligible for services under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1431, et seq. Early intervention services shall include services under an active individualized family service plan that enhance functional ability without effecting a cure. An individualized family service plan is a written plan for providing early intervention services to an eligible child and the child's family that is adopted in accordance with 20 U.S.C. Section 1436. The Part C early intervention system, on behalf of its contracted regional Part C early intervention system centers and providers, shall be considered the rendering provider of services for purposes of this section.\n\n5. No payment made for specified early intervention services shall be applied by the health carrier or health benefit plan against any maximum lifetime aggregate specified in the policy or health benefit plan if the carrier opts to satisfy its obligations under this section under subdivision (2) of subsection 7 of this section. A health benefit plan shall be billed at the applicable Medicaid rate at the time the covered benefit is delivered, and the health benefit plan shall pay the Part C early intervention system at such rate for benefits covered by this section. Services under the Part C early intervention system shall be delivered as prescribed by the individualized family service plan and an electronic claim filed in accordance with the carrier's or plan's standard format. Beginning January 1, 2007, such claims' payments shall be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 376.383 and 376.384.\n\n6. The health care service required by this section shall not be subject to any greater deductible, co-payment, or coinsurance than other similar health care services provided by the health benefit plan.\n\n7. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, payments made during a calendar year by a health carrier or group of carriers affiliated by or under common ownership or control to the Part C early intervention system for services provided to children covered by the Part C early intervention system shall not exceed one-half of one percent of the direct written premium for health benefit plans as reported to the department of commerce and insurance on the health carrier's most recently filed annual financial statement.\n\n(2) In lieu of reimbursing claims under this section, a carrier or group of carriers affiliated by or under common ownership or control may, on behalf of all of the carrier's or carriers' health benefit plan or plans providing coverage under this section, directly pay the Part C early intervention system by January thirty-first of the calendar year an amount equal to one-half of one percent of the direct written premium for health benefit plans as reported to the department of commerce and insurance on the health carrier's most recently filed annual financial statement, or five hundred thousand dollars, whichever is less, and such payment shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of the health benefit plan's obligation for the calendar year. Nothing in this subsection shall require a health carrier or health benefit plan providing coverage under this section to amend or modify any provision of an existing policy or plan relating to the payment or reimbursement of claims by the health carrier or health benefit plan.\n\n8. This section shall not apply to a supplemental insurance policy, including a life care contract, specified disease policy, hospital policy providing a fixed daily benefit only, Medicare supplement policy, hospitalization-surgical care policy, policy that is individually underwritten or provides such coverage for specific individuals and members of their families, long-term care policy, or short-term major medical policies of six months or less duration.\n\n9. Except for health carriers or health benefit plans making payments under subdivision (2) of subsection 7 of this section, the department of commerce and insurance shall collect data related to the number of children receiving private insurance coverage under this section and the total amount of moneys paid on behalf of such children by private health carriers or health benefit plans. The department shall report to the general assembly regarding the department's findings no later than January 30, 2007, and annually thereafter.\n\n10.

Coverage of services may be subject to other general exclusions and limitations of the contract or benefit plan, not in conflict with the provisions of this section, such as coordination of benefits, exclusions for services provided by family or household members, and utilization review of health care services, including review of medical necessity and care management; however, coverage for treatment under this section shall not be denied on the basis that it is educational or habilitative in nature.\n\n8.

The provisions of this section shall also apply to the following types of plans that are established, extended, modified, or renewed on or after January 1, 2020:\n\n(1) All self-insured governmental plans, as that term is defined in 29 U.S.C.

This section shall not be construed as affecting any obligation to provide services to an individual under an individualized family service plan, an individualized education plan, or an individualized service plan. This section shall not be construed as affecting any obligation to provide reimbursement pursuant to section 376.1218.\n\n14. The provisions of sections 376.383, 376.384, and 376.1350 to 376.1399 shall apply to this section.\n\n15.

An insurer shall perform a comparison of its in-force life insurance policies, contracts, and retained asset accounts against a death master file on at least a semiannual basis by using the full death master file one time and thereafter using the death master file update files for future comparisons to identify potential matches. Nothing in this section shall limit an insurer from requesting a valid death certificate as part of any claims validation process. For those potential matches identified as a result of a death master file match, the insurer shall, within ninety days of a death master file match:\n\n(1) Complete a good-faith effort, which shall be documented by the insurer, to confirm the death of the insured, annuitant, or retained asset account holder against other available records and information; and\n\n(2) Use good-faith efforts to determine whether benefits are due in accordance with the applicable policy or contract and, if benefits are due in accordance with the applicable policy or contract:\n\n(a) Use good-faith efforts, which shall be documented by the insurer, to locate the beneficiary or beneficiaries; and\n\n(b) Provide the appropriate claims forms or instructions to each beneficiary or beneficiaries to make a claim, including the need to provide an official death certificate if applicable under the policy or contract.\n\n2. To the extent that an insurer's records of its in-force policies, contracts, and account owners are available electronically, an insurer shall perform the comparison required by subsection 1 of this section using such electronic records. To the extent that an insurer's records of its in-force policies, contracts, and account owners are not available electronically, an insurer shall perform the comparison required by subsection 1 of this section using the records most easily accessible by the insurer.\n\n3. In the event an insurer is unable to confirm the death of a person following a death master file match and completion of the good-faith efforts described in subsection 1 of this section, an insurer may consider such policy, contract, or retired asset account to be in force according to its terms.\n\n4. With respect to group life insurance, the insurer is required to confirm the possible death of an insured or certificate holder only if the insurer has agreed to provide record-keeping services.\n\n5. To the extent permitted by law, the insurer may disclose the minimum necessary personal information about the insured or beneficiary to a person whom the insurer reasonably believes may be able to assist the insurer to locate the beneficiary or a person otherwise entitled to payment of the claims proceeds.\n\n6. An insurer or its service provider shall not charge any beneficiary or other authorized representative for any fees or costs associated with a death master file search or verification of a death master file match conducted in accordance with this section.\n\n7. The benefits from a policy, contract, or retained asset account, plus any applicable accrued contractual interest, shall first be payable to the designated beneficiaries or owners, or in the event such beneficiaries or owners cannot be found shall escheat to the state as unclaimed property under section 447.510.\n\n8. The director may promulgate rules and regulations as may be reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of sections 376.2050 to 376.2053. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2016, shall be invalid and void.\n\n9. The failure to meet any requirements of sections 376.2050 to 376.2053 with such frequency as to constitute a general business practice shall constitute an unfair trade practice under the provisions of sections 375.930 to 375.948. Nothing in sections 376.2050 to 376.2053 shall be construed to create or imply a private cause of action for a violation of sections 376.2050 to 376.2053.\n\n10. Nothing in sections 376.2050 to 376.2053 limits an insurer from requiring compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract relative to filing and payment of claims.\n\n11. The director may exempt an insurer from the comparison required by subsection 1 of this section if the insurer demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that compliance would result in undue hardship to the insurer.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 2150)",
