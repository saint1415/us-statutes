Relief issued by director for violations of state laws — considerations — notice — effective date of order — contents of order, procedures — penalty — costs — powers of director — service — order filed — noncompliance — modification of order — additional penalties — definitions. —1. If the director determines based upon substantial and competent evidence that a person has engaged, is engaging in or has taken a substantial step toward engaging in an act, practice, omission, or course of business constituting a violation of the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354, and chapters 375 to 385, or a rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto or that a person has materially aided or is materially aiding an act, practice, omission, or course of business constituting a violation of the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354, and chapters 375 to 385, or a rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto, the director may order the following relief:\n\n(1) An order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in the act, practice, omission, or course of business;\n\n(2) A curative order or order directing the person to take other action necessary or appropriate to comply with the insurance laws of this state;\n\n(3) Order a civil penalty or forfeiture as provided in section 374.049; and\n\n(4) Award reasonable costs of the investigation.\n\n2. In determining any relief sought, the director shall consider, among other factors, whether:\n\n(1) The violations are likely to continue or reoccur;\n\n(2) Actual financial loss was sustained by consumers and restitution has been made;\n\n(3) The act, practice, omission, or course of business was detected as part of a self-audit or internal compliance program and immediately reported to the director; and\n\n(4) The act, practice, omission, or course of business had previously been detected, but inadequate policies and procedures were implemented to prevent reoccurrence.\n\n3. Unless the director determines that a summary order is appropriate under subsection 4 of this section, the director shall provide notice of the intent to initiate administrative enforcement by serving a statement of the reasons for the action upon any person subject to the proceedings. A statement of reasons, together with an order to show cause why a cease and desist order and other relief should not be issued, shall be served either personally or by certified mail on any person named therein. The director shall schedule a time and place at least ten days thereafter for hearing, and after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, the director may issue a final order under subsection 6 of this section.\n\n4. If the director determines that sections 375.014, 375.144, or 375.310 are being violated and consumers are being aggrieved by the violations, the order issued under subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of this section may be summary and be effective on the date of issuance. Upon issuance of the order, the director shall promptly serve each person subject to the order with a copy of the order and a notice that the order has been entered.\n\n5. A summary order issued under subsection 4 of this section must include a statement of the reasons for the order, notice within five days after receipt of a request in a record from the person that the matter will be scheduled for a hearing, and a statement whether the department is seeking a civil penalty or costs of the investigation. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and none is ordered by the director within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final as to that person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the director, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.\n\n6. If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection 3 or subsection 5 of this section, a hearing before the director or a hearing officer designated by the director must be provided. A final order may not be issued unless the director makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with the provisions of chapter 536 and procedural rules promulgated by the director. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection 5 of this section.\n\n7. In a final order under subsection 6 of this section, the director may impose a civil penalty or forfeiture as provided in section 374.049. No civil penalty or forfeiture may be imposed against a person unless the person has engaged in the act, practice, omission, or course of business constituting the violation.\n\n8. In a final order under subsection 6 of this section, the director may charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of the insurance laws of this state or a rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto. These funds shall be paid to the director to the credit of the insurance dedicated fund.\n\n9. The director is authorized to issue subpoenas, compel attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, hear testimony of witnesses, receive evidence, and require the production of books, papers, records, correspondence, and all other written instruments or documents relevant to the proceeding and authorized in contested cases under the provisions of chapter 536 and procedural rules promulgated by the director.\n\n10. Statements of charges, notices, orders, and other processes of the director may be served by anyone duly authorized by the director either in the manner provided by law for service of process in civil actions, or by registering or certifying and mailing a copy thereof to the person affected by such statement, notice, order, or other process at his or its residence or principal office or place of business. The verified return by the person so serving such statement, notice, order, or other process setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of the same, and the return postcard receipt for such statement, notice, order, or other process, registered and mailed as aforesaid, shall be proof of the service of the same.\n\n11. If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with section 374.055, the director may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.\n\n12. If a person violates or does not comply with an order under this section, the director may under section 374.048 petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court may not require the director to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may, in addition to relief authorized in section 374.048, adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. A violation of or failure to comply with an order under this section is a level three violation under section 374.049. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not less than five thousand dollars but not greater than one hundred thousand dollars for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.\n\n13. Until the expiration of the time allowed under section 374.055 for filing a petition for judicial review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time or if a petition for review has been filed within such time, then until the transcript of the record in the proceeding has been filed in the circuit court of Cole County, the director may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as he shall deem proper, modify or set aside in whole or in part any order issued by him under this section.\n\n14. The enforcement authority of the director under this section is cumulative to any other statutory authority of the director.\n\n15. The director is authorized to issue administrative consent orders in the public interest as complete or partial settlement of any investigation, examination, or other proceeding, which curative orders may contain any provision necessary or appropriate to assure compliance with the insurance laws of this state, require payment of restitution to be distributed directly or by the director to any aggrieved consumers, civil penalties, or voluntary forfeiture, reimbursement for costs of investigation or examination, or any other relief deemed by the director to be necessary and appropriate. Any remaining matters not addressed in settlement may be submitted to the director through a contested proceeding under this section.\n\n16. (1) Any person willfully violating any provision of any cease and desist order of the director after it becomes final, while the same is in force, upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred thousand dollars, by imprisonment of up to ten years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\n\n(2) In addition to any other penalty provided, violation of any cease and desist order shall subject the violator to suspension or revocation of any certificate of authority or license as may be applicable under the laws of this state relating to the business of insurance.\n\n17. The term\"person\"as used in this chapter shall include any individual, partnership, corporation, association or trust, or any other legal entity.\n\n18. The term\"order\"as used in this chapter shall include a formal administrative direction or command of the director issued under this section or in any contested case subject to the provisions of section 536.063 or any lawful administrative proceeding subject to judicial review, but shall not include department bulletins, no-action letters, advisory opinions, or any other statement of general applicability that should be adopted by rule.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 516, A.L. 2006 H.B. 1837)\n\n(1984) Nothing in this section prevents the Governor from directing the division of insurance to issue a cease and desist order.

In an action under this section and on a proper showing, the court may:\n\n(1) Issue a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or declaratory judgment;\n\n(2) Order other appropriate or ancillary relief, which may include:\n\n(a) An asset freeze, accounting, writ of attachment, writ of general or specific execution, and appointment of a receiver or conservator, which may be the director, for the defendant or the defendant's assets;\n\n(b) Ordering the director to take charge and control of a defendant's property, including accounts in a depository institution, rents, and profits; to collect debts; and to acquire and dispose of property;\n\n(c) Imposing a civil penalty or forfeiture as provided in section 374.049;\n\n(d) Upon showing financial loss, injury, or harm to identifiable consumers, imposing an order of restitution or disgorgement directed to a person who has engaged in an act, practice, omission, or course of business in violation of the laws or rules relating to insurance;\n\n(e) Ordering the payment of prejudgment and postjudgment interest;\n\n(f) Ordering reasonable costs of investigation and prosecution; and\n\n(g) Ordering the payment to the insurance dedicated fund an additional amount equal to ten percent of the total restitution or disgorgement ordered, or such other amount as awarded by the court, which shall be appropriated to an insurance consumer education program administered by the director; or\n\n(3) Order such other relief as the court considers necessary or appropriate.\n\n3. The director may not be required to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section.\n\n4. The case may be brought in the circuit court of Cole County, any county or city not within a county in which a violation has occurred, or any county or city not within a county which has venue of an action against the person, partnership, or corporation under other provisions of law.\n\n5. The enforcement authority of the director under this section is cumulative to any other authority of the director to impose orders under other provisions of the laws relating to insurance in this state.\n\n6. If the director determines it to be in the public interest, the director is authorized to enter into a consent injunction and judgment in the settlement of any proceeding under the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354 and chapters 375 to 385.\n\n7. A \"Consumer Restitution Fund\" shall be created for the purpose of preserving and distributing to aggrieved consumers disgorgement or restitution funds obtained through enforcement proceedings brought by the director. In addition to the equitable powers of the court authorized above, the court may order that such funds be paid into the consumer restitution fund for distribution to aggrieved consumers. It shall be the duty of the director to distribute such funds to those persons injured by the unlawful acts, practices, omissions, or courses of business by the subject of the proceeding. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080, any funds remaining in the director's consumer restitution fund at the end of any biennium shall not be transferred to the general revenue fund, but if the director is unable with reasonable efforts to ascertain the aggrieved consumers, then the funds may be transferred to the insurance dedicated fund to be used for consumer education.\n\n(L. 2006 H.B. 1837)",

Violations of the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354 and chapters 375 to 385, or a rule adopted or order issued by the director, are classified for the purpose of civil penalties and forfeitures into the following five classifications:\n\n(1) Level one violations;\n\n(2) Level two violations;\n\n(3) Level three violations;\n\n(4) Level four violations; and\n\n(5) Level five violations.\n\n2. An order to impose a civil penalty or forfeiture, when imposed by the director in an administrative proceeding under section 374.046 on a person for any violation of the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354 and chapters 375 to 385, or a rule adopted or order issued by the director, shall be an order to pay an amount not exceeding the following:\n\n(1) No civil penalty or forfeiture for a level one violation;\n\n(2) One thousand dollars per each level two violation, up to an aggregate civil penalty or forfeiture of fifty thousand dollars per annum for multiple violations;\n\n(3) Five thousand dollars per each level three violation, up to an aggregate civil penalty or forfeiture of one hundred thousand dollars per annum for multiple violations;\n\n(4) Ten thousand dollars per each level four violation, up to an aggregate civil penalty or forfeiture of two hundred fifty thousand dollars per annum for multiple violations;\n\n(5) Fifty thousand dollars per each level five violation, up to an aggregate civil penalty or forfeiture of two hundred fifty thousand dollars per annum for multiple violations.\n\n3.

No civil penalty or forfeiture may be imposed against a person, unless the person has engaged in the act, practice, omission or course of business constituting the violation.\n\n5. Any violation of the laws of this state relating to insurance in this chapter, chapter 354 and chapters 375 to 385, which is not classified or does not authorize a specific range for a civil penalty or forfeiture for violations, shall be classified as a level one violation. In bringing an action to enforce a rule adopted by the director, unless the conduct that violates the rule also violates the enabling statute, the violation shall be classified as a level one violation and shall not be subject to any provision in this section regarding the enhancement of a civil penalty or forfeiture.\n\n6. The civil penalties or forfeitures set forth in this section establish a maximum range. The court, or the director in administrative enforcement, shall consider all of the circumstances, including the nature of violations to determine whether, and to any extent, a civil penalty or forfeiture is justified.\n\n7. In any enforcement proceeding, the court, or director in administrative enforcement, may enhance the civil penalty or forfeiture with a one-classification step increase under this section, if the violation was knowing. The court, or director in administrative enforcement, may enhance the civil penalty or forfeiture with a two-level increase if the violation was knowingly committed in conscious disregard of the law.\n\n8. In any enforcement proceeding, the court, or director in administrative enforcement, may, after consideration of the factors specified in subsection 2 of section 374.046, enhance the civil penalty or forfeiture with a one-classification step increase under this section, if the violations resulted in actual financial loss to consumers.\n\n9. In any enforcement proceeding, the court, or director in administrative enforcement, shall reduce the civil penalty or forfeiture on that person with up to a two-classification step reduction under this section, if prior to receiving notice of the violation from the department, the person detects the violation through a self-audit or internal compliance program reasonably designed to detect and prevent insurance law violations and immediately reports the violation to the director.\n\n10. If more than one error is caused by a single act or omission in the use of data processing equipment and such errors are not known by the violator at the time the error occurs, then any such errors shall be regarded as a single violation under this section.\n\n11. Any civil penalty or forfeiture recovered by the director shall be paid to the treasurer and then distributed to the public schools as required by Article IX, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution.\n\n12.

Examination, director may conduct when, required when — duties — nonresident insurer, options, procedures — reports, contents, use of — hearings, procedures — working papers, records, confidential. —1. (1) The director or any of the director's examiners may conduct an examination pursuant to sections 374.202 to 374.207 of any company as often as the director in his or her sole discretion deems appropriate, but shall, at a minimum, conduct a financial examination of every insurer licensed in this state at least once every five years. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of examinations, the director may consider such matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants, consumer complaints, and other criteria as set forth in the Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the director exercises discretion pursuant to this section.\n\n(2) For purposes of completing an examination of any company pursuant to sections 374.202 to 374.207, the director may examine or investigate any person, or the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the director, necessary or material to the examination of the company.\n\n(3) In lieu of a financial examination pursuant to section 374.207 of any foreign or alien insurer licensed in this state, the director may accept a financial examination report on the company as prepared by the insurance department or other appropriate agency for the company's state of domicile or port-of-entry state until January 1, 1994. After January 1, 1994, such reports may only be accepted if such insurance department or other appropriate agency was at the time of the examination accredited pursuant to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program or the examination is performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or other appropriate agency or with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by such an accredited state insurance department or other appropriate agency and who, after a review of the examination workpapers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department or other appropriate agency.\n\n2. (1) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the director or the director's designee shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination, the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The director may also employ such other guidelines or procedures as the director may deem appropriate.\n\n(2) Every company or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors and agents shall provide to the examiners appointed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection timely, convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents and any or all computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business and affairs of the company being examined. The company or person being examined shall provide within ten calendar days any record requested by an examiner during a market conduct examination, unless such company or person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the requested record cannot be provided within ten calendar days of the request. All policy records for each policy issued shall be maintained for the duration of the current policy term plus two calendar years and all claim files shall be maintained for the calendar year in which the claim is closed plus three calendar years. The officers, directors, employees and agents of the company or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of any company, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the examiners shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of, any license or authority held by the company to engage in an insurance or other business subject to the director's jurisdiction. Any such proceeding for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to section 374.046.\n\n(3) The director or any of the director's examiners may issue subpoenas to administer oaths and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. Such subpoenas may also be enforced pursuant to the provisions of sections 375.881 and 375.1162.\n\n(4) When making an examination pursuant to sections 374.202 to 374.207, the director may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the cost of which shall be borne directly by the company which is the subject of the examination.\n\n(5) The provisions of sections 374.202 to 374.207 shall not be construed to limit the director's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.\n\n(6) Nothing contained in sections 374.202 to 374.207 shall be construed to limit the director's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company workpapers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the director may, in his or her sole discretion, deem appropriate.\n\n3. (1) All examination reports shall be comprised of only facts appearing upon the books, records, or other documents of the company, its agents or other persons examined, or as ascertained from the testimony of its officers or agents or other persons examined concerning its affairs, and such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.\n\n(2) No later than sixty days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the department a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the company examined, together with a notice which shall afford the company examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report.\n\n(3) Within thirty days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the director shall fully consider and review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers and either initiate legal action or enter an order:\n\n(a) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating in violation of any law, regulation or prior order of the director, the director may order the company to take any action the director considers necessary and appropriate to cure such violation;\n\n(b) Rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data, documentation or information, and refiling pursuant to subsection 1 of this section;\n\n(c) Calling for an investigatory hearing with no less than twenty days' notice to the company for purposes of obtaining additional documentation, data, information and testimony; or\n\n(d) Calling for such regulatory action as the director deems appropriate, provided that this order shall be a confidential internal order directing the department to take certain action.\n\n(4) All orders entered pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions resulting from the director's consideration and review of the examination report, relevant examiner workpapers and any written submissions or rebuttals. Any such order shall be considered a final administrative decision and may be appealed pursuant to section 536.150 and shall be served upon the company by certified mail, together with a copy of the adopted examination report. Within thirty days of the issuance of the adopted report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and related orders. In lieu of the preceding affidavit requirement, in the case of an adopted market conduct report, rather than an adopted financial examination report, the company may file an affidavit executed by its general counsel or chief legal officer stating under oath that the general counsel or chief legal officer has received a copy of the adopted market conduct report and related orders. Any hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision (3) of this subsection by the director or authorized representative shall be conducted as a nonadversarial confidential investigatory proceeding as necessary for the resolution of any inconsistencies, discrepancies or disputed issues apparent upon the face of the filed examination report or raised by or as a result of the director's review of relevant workpapers or by the written submission or rebuttal of the company. Within twenty days of the conclusion of any such hearing, the director shall enter an order pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection. In conducting a hearing pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision (3) of this subsection:\n\n(a) The director shall not appoint an examiner as an authorized representative to conduct the hearing. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously with discovery by the company limited to the examiner's workpapers which tend to substantiate any assertions set forth in any written submission or rebuttal. The director or his or her representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance of any witnesses or the production of any documents deemed relevant to the investigation whether under the control of the department, the company or other persons. The documents produced shall be included in the record, and testimony taken by the director or his or her representative shall be under oath and preserved for the record. The provisions of this section shall not require the department to disclose any information or records which would indicate or show the existence of any investigation or activity of a criminal justice agency; and\n\n(b) The hearing shall proceed with the director or his or her representative posing questions to the persons subpoenaed. Thereafter, the company and the department may present testimony relevant to the investigation. Cross-examination shall be conducted only by the director or the director's representative. The company and the department shall be permitted to make closing statements and may be represented by counsel of their choice.\n\n(5) Upon the adoption of the examination report pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection, the director shall continue to hold the content of the examination report as private and confidential information for a period of ten days except to the extent provided in this subdivision. Thereafter, the director may open the report for public inspection so long as no court of competent jurisdiction has stayed its publication. Nothing contained in the insurance laws of this state shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the director from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to the insurance department of this or any other state or country, or to law enforcement officials of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this section. In the event the director determines that legal or regulatory action is appropriate as a result of any examination, he or she may initiate any proceedings or actions as provided by law.\n\n4. All working papers, recorded information, documents and copies thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the director or any person in the course of an examination made pursuant to this section shall be given confidential treatment and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public by the director or any other person, except to the extent provided in subdivision (5) of subsection 3 of this section. Access may also be granted to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Such parties shall agree in writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the same confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the prior written consent of the company to which it pertains has been obtained.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 1997 H.B. 626 merged with H.B. 793, A.L. 1999 S.B. 19 merged with S.B. 386, A.L. 2016 H.B. 2194)",

The Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the Bylaws.\n\nARTICLE VII.\n\nRULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES: RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION AND OPTING OUT OF UNIFORM STANDARDS\n\n1. Rulemaking Authority. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act*, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.\n\n2. Rulemaking Procedure. Rules and Operating Procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard. The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.\n\n3. Effective Date and Opt Out of a Uniform Standard. A Uniform Standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article.\"Opt out\"shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard. All other Rules and Operating Procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, Operating Procedure or amendment.\n\n4. Opt Out Procedure. A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the Compacting State's Administrative Procedure Act. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (a) give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State and (b) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State. The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State which warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State. The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this Act*; and (ii) the presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Compacting State may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.\n\n5. Effect of Opt Out. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State. If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.\n\n6. Stay of Uniform Standard. If a Compacting State has formally initiated the process of opting out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the Compacting State may petition the Commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the Uniform Standard, to stay the effectiveness of the Uniform Standard in that State. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the Compacting State can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the Compacting State from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.\n\n7. Not later than thirty (30) days after a Rule or Operating Procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the Rule or Operating Procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the Rule or Operating Procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule or Operating Procedure to be unlawful if the Rule or Operating Procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission's authority.\n\nARTICLE VIII.\n\nCOMMISSION RECORDS AND ENFORCEMENT\n\n1. The Commission shall promulgate Rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The Commission may promulgate additional Rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.\n\n2. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any Compacting State pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any Compacting State Commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the Commission; provided, that disclosure to the Commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act*, the Commission shall not be subject to the Compacting State's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any Commissioner.\n\n3. The Commission shall monitor Compacting States for compliance with duly adopted Bylaws, Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures. The Commission shall notify any non-complying Compacting State in writing of its noncompliance with Commission Bylaws, Rules or Operating Procedures. If a non-complying Compacting State fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the Compacting State shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV.\n\n4. The Commissioner of any State in which an Insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the Insurer in accordance with the provisions of the State's law. The Commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the Compact is governed by the following provisions:\n\na. With respect to the Commissioner's market regulation of a Product or Advertisement that is approved or certified to the Commission, the content of the Product or Advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the Compact except upon a final order of the Commission, issued at the request of a Commissioner after prior notice to the Insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the Commission.\n\nb. Before a Commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the Compact relating to the content of an Advertisement not approved or certified to the Commission, the Commission, or an authorized Commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the Insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the Commission's action on such requests.\n\nARTICLE IX.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nThe Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a Member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this Compact and which may arise between two or more Compacting States, or between Compacting States and Non-compacting States, and the Commission shall promulgate an Operating Procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.\n\nPRODUCT FILING AND APPROVAL\n\n1. Insurers and Third-Party Filers seeking to have a Product approved by the Commission shall file the Product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the Commission. Nothing in this Act*shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its Product with the insurance department in any State wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the States where filed.\n\n2. The Commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to Commission Rules and Operating Procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the Commission will provide public access to Product filing information. In establishing such Rules, the Commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a Product filing or supporting information.\n\n3. Any Product approved by the Commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those Compacting States for which the Insurer is legally authorized to do business.\n\nARTICLE XI.\n\nREVIEW OF COMMISSION DECISIONS REGARDING FILINGS\n\n1. Not later than thirty (30) days after the Commission has given notice of a disapproved Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, the Insurer or Third Party Filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the Commission, in disapproving a Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with Article III, Section 4.\n\n2. The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider Products and Advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant Uniform Standard. Where appropriate, the Commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in Section 1 above.\n\nARTICLE XII.\n\n1. The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the Commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Compacting States and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the Commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.\n\n2. The Commission shall collect a filing fee from each Insurer and Third Party Filer filing a product with the Commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commission's annual budget.\n\n3. The Commission's budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VII of this Compact.\n\n4. The Commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the Compacting States.\n\n5. The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any Compacting State, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that Compacting State.\n\n6. The Commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the Commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its Bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the Commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the Commission, but no less frequently than every three (3) years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the Commission. The Commission shall make an Annual Report to the Governor and legislature of the Compacting States, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The Commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the Commissioner of any Compacting State upon request provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.\n\n7. No Compacting State shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the Commission or to any Commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.\n\nARTICLE XIII.\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\n1. Any State is eligible to become a Compacting State.\n\n2. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by two Compacting States; provided, the Commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting Uniform Standards for, reviewing, and giving approval or disapproval of, Products filed with the Commission that satisfy applicable Uniform Standards only after twenty-six (26) States are Compacting States or, alternatively, by States representing greater than forty percent (40%) of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the NAIC for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other Compacting State upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State.\n\n3. Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Commission and the Compacting States unless and until all Compacting States enact the amendment into law.\n\nARTICLE XIV.\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT AND TERMINATION\n\n1. Withdrawal\n\na. Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (\"Withdrawing State\" ) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.\n\nb. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any Advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State unless the approval is rescinded by the Withdrawing State as provided in Paragraph e of this section.\n\nc. The Commissioner of the Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Management Committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State.\n\nd. The Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof.\n\ne. The Withdrawing State is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State. The Commission's approval of Products and Advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the Withdrawing State, unless formally rescinded by the Withdrawing State in the same manner as provided by the laws of the Withdrawing State for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.\n\nf. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the effective date of the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact.\n\na. If the Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (\"Defaulting State\" ) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or duly promulgated Rules or Operating Procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the Bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact on the Defaulting State shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in Commission Rules. The Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the Defaulting State's suspension pending a cure of the default. The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the Defaulting State shall be terminated from the Compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\nb. Product approvals by the Commission or product self-certifications, or any Advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the Defaulting State in the same manner as if the Defaulting State had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to Section 1 of this article.\n\nc. Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires a reenactment of the Compact.\n\n3. Dissolution of Compact\n\na. The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.\n\nb. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XV.\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n1. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.\n\n2. The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XVI.\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\n1. Other Laws\n\na. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State, except as provided in Paragraph b of this section.\n\nb. For any Product approved or certified to the Commission, the Rules, Uniform Standards and any other requirements of the Commission shall constitute the exclusive provisions applicable to the content, approval and certification of such Products. For Advertisement that is subject to the Commission's authority, any Rule, Uniform Standard or other requirement of the Commission which governs the content of the Advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a Commissioner may apply to the content of the Advertisement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the Commission shall abrogate or restrict: (i) the access of any person to state courts; (ii) remedies available under state law related to breach of contract, tort, or other laws not specifically directed to the content of the Product; (iii) state law relating to the construction of insurance contracts; or (iv) the authority of the attorney general of the state, including but not limited to maintaining any actions or proceedings, as authorized by law.\n\nc. All insurance products filed with individual States shall be subject to the laws of those States.\n\n2. Binding Effect of this Compact\n\na. All lawful actions of the Commission, including all Rules and Operating Procedures promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.\n\nb. All agreements between the Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nc. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation in dispute.\n\nd. In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by that provision upon the Commission shall be ineffective as to that Compacting State, and those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.\n\n(L. 2009 H.B. 577)\n\n*\"This act\" (H.B. 577, 2009) contained numerous sections.
