Cumulative voting shall only be permitted at any meeting of the members or stockholders in electing directors when it is provided for in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The board of directors may remove a director if the director is adjudicated disabled or incapacitated by a court, is a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding, is convicted of a felony, fails to fulfill any of the requirements for holding office, or fails to attend regular meetings of the board for such period as is established by the bylaws without having been excused by the board.\n\n2.

The bylaws may prescribe a maximum age beyond which a person shall be ineligible for election to the board of directors and may prescribe a mandatory retirement age of seventy-five years or less for directors.

An association may make any type of account contract not prohibited by sections 369.010 to 369.369 or by other applicable law or by regulations of the director of the division of finance. An association is authorized to accept accounts which permit the account holder to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instrument for the purpose of making transfers to third parties whether or not earnings are paid on such account; provided such accounts will be permitted if and only to the extent permitted to associations chartered by the United States.\n\n2. Accounts may be opened and owned by any one or more persons, partnerships, associations, corporations, political subdivisions, or public or governmental units; shall be represented on the books of an association by a separate account in the name of the owner thereof; and shall be transferable only in the manner authorized by the association's board of directors. An association shall be under no duty to determine the ownership of the funds received by it for any account and shall treat the account holder of record as shown by the account contract as the owner for all purposes. An association shall not be liable to any person claiming any interest in an account unless the interest of such person appears in the account contract or has been established by a decree or order of court determining the ownership and a copy of such decree or order has been furnished the association. These provisions shall apply even though the name of the person appearing on the account contract as owner is modified by a qualifying or descriptive term such as \"agent\", \"trustee\", or other word or phrase indicating that such person may not be the owner in the person's own right. The association shall have a lien on an account for all amounts owed it by the owner thereof. The owner of an account may pledge the account to secure the owner's own obligation or that of another and, if written notice of such pledge is served upon the association, the pledgee shall be protected.\n\n3. The association may issue any evidence of ownership of an account not prohibited by sections 369.010 to 369.369 or by other applicable law or by regulations of the director of the division of finance. The evidence of ownership shall not be subject to article 8 of chapter 400 or to chapter 409.\n\n4. Upon the filing with an association by the owner or by the owner's personal representative of an affidavit stating that the evidence of ownership of such person's account has been lost or destroyed and that it has not been pledged or assigned, in whole or in part, the association may issue new evidence of ownership in the name of such owner stating that it is issued in lieu of the one lost or destroyed. The association shall not be liable thereafter with respect to the original evidence of ownership, but the board of directors may require a bond in sufficient amount to indemnify the association against any loss or expense which may result from the issuance of the substitute evidence of ownership.\n\n5. If an account owner has been adjudicated a disabled person by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments made to such account owner prior to service on the association of a certified copy of such adjudication shall discharge the association to the extent thereof. After service of such notice, withdrawal or pledge on behalf of the disabled person shall be by his conservator.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 3 § 30, A.L. 1982 S.B. 464, A.L. 1983 S.B. 44 & 45, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1165)\n\nEffective 7-06-94",

The opening or maintenance of the account in such form, in the absence of fraud or undue influence, shall be conclusive evidence in any action or proceeding to which the association or any survivor or the personal representative of a deceased owner is a party of the intention of all the parties to the account to vest title to the account and the additions and earnings thereto in the survivor. A person may be added or removed as an owner of an account upon the written direction of any owner of the account upon whose signature withdrawals may be made from the account. By written instructions of all joint tenants given to the association, they may require the signatures of more than one of such persons during their lifetimes or of more than one of the survivors after the death of any one of them on any notice of withdrawal, request for withdrawal, check endorsement or receipt, or remove any such requirement, in which case the association shall pay withdrawals and earnings only in accordance with such instructions, but no such instructions shall limit the right of the sole survivor or of all of the survivors to receive withdrawal payments and earnings. Payment of all or any of the moneys in the account or payment of earnings thereon as provided in this section is a valid and sufficient release and discharge of the association with respect to the moneys so paid prior to receipt by the association of a written notice from any one of the account owners directing the association not to permit withdrawals or make payments in accordance with the terms of the account or the written instructions. After receipt of such notice an association may refuse without liability to honor any check, receipt or withdrawal order or pay any earnings on the account pending determination of the rights of the parties, but is not required to do so. No association paying any survivor in accordance with the provisions of this section shall thereby be liable for any estate or succession taxes which may be due this state.

The adjudication of disability or incapacity of any one or more of the joint tenants shall not operate to sever or terminate the joint tenancy ownership of all or any part of the account and the account may be withdrawn or pledged by any one or more of the joint owners in the same manner as though the adjudication of disability or incapacity had not been made except that any withdrawal or pledge on behalf of the disabled joint owner shall be by his conservator.\n\n4.

If the director of the division of finance finds, as a result of any examination or from any report made to the director or to any association, that the association is violating the provisions of its articles of incorporation, its bylaws or any law of this state, or is conducting its business in an unsafe or injurious manner, the director may by an order addressed to such association direct a discontinuance of such violations or unsafe or injurious practices and require conformity with all of the requirements of law.\n\n2. The director may demand and take possession of the property, business and assets of an association if any of the following occur:\n\n(1) The association does not comply with the order given pursuant to subsection 1 of this section within the time specified therein;\n\n(2) It appears to the director that the association is in an unsafe condition or is conducting its business in an unsafe or injurious manner such as to render its further proceeding hazardous to the public or to any or all its savings account holders;\n\n(3) The director finds that the association's assets are impaired to such an extent that after deducting all liabilities other than to its savings account holders they do not equal or exceed the sum of the withdrawal value of all its savings accounts; or\n\n(4) The association refuses to submit its books, papers and accounts to the inspection of the director or any of the director's examiners.\n\n3. The director may retain possession of the property, business and assets of an association until the association resumes business with the consent of and subject to the conditions imposed by the director or until its affairs are liquidated. The director shall permit the association to resume business if at any time during the director's possession of the association's property, business and assets the director finds that the association is in a condition safely to resume business.\n\n4. Whenever the director takes possession pursuant to this section, the association may within ten days after the taking of possession commence an action in the circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the association is located to enjoin further proceedings. The court, after citing the director to show cause why further proceedings should not be enjoined, hearing the allegations and proofs of the parties, and determining the facts, may upon the merits dismiss such action, or may enjoin the director from further proceeding and direct the director to surrender the business, property and assets of the association. An appeal from a judgment enjoining the director from further proceedings and directing the director to surrender the business, property and assets to the association does not operate as a stay of the judgment unless the circuit court in its discretion so orders. If an appeal from the judgment is taken by the director, no bond need be given. If the judgment dismisses the action, an appeal therefrom does not operate as a stay of the judgment, but the court rendering such judgment may in its discretion enjoin the director, pending the appeal, from further proceedings and direct the director, pending the appeal, to surrender such business, property and assets to the association if a bond in an amount required by the court is given.\n\n5. If the director's demand for the possession of the property, business and assets is not complied with within twenty-four hours after service of the demand, the director may call to the director's assistance the sheriff of the county in which the principal place of business of such association is located, by giving the sheriff written demand. The sheriff shall enforce the demand of the director.\n\n6. When the director takes possession of the property, business and assets of any association, the president and secretary of the association shall make a verified schedule of all its property, assets and collateral held by it as security for loans. The president and secretary shall deliver the schedule, and possession of all property, assets and collateral not previously delivered, to the director. The director may at any time examine under oath any president, secretary, officer, director, agent or employee of the association to determine whether or not all such property, assets or collateral have been transferred and delivered into the director's possession.\n\n7.

Unless the director finds either as the result of an examination or otherwise that the association is in an impaired condition, the director may while in possession of an association accept additional accounts or payments to existing accounts with such provisions for preference of the funds so received, or for segregating or trusteeing such funds or the assets arising from the investment thereof, or for both, as the director deems appropriate for the protection of the account holders providing such funds. The director may pay earnings on accounts at such rate as he deems appropriate for the protection of the association and its account holders; and the director may pay the withdrawal value of accounts, either with or without notice subject to other provisions of sections 369.010 to 369.369 and to such limitations and restrictions, if any, as the director deems appropriate for the protection of the association and its account holders.\n\n3.

The appropriate order shall be entered after a hearing on such notice as the court prescribes.\n\n4. The director may also disaffirm any executory contracts including leases to which the association is a party and disaffirm any partially executed contracts including leases to the extent that they remain executory. The disaffirmance shall be made within six months after obtaining knowledge of the existence of the contract or lease. Claims for damages resulting from the disaffirmance of an executory contract or lease by the director may be filed and allowed.

The director may propose a merger or consolidation with another association to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 369.079, and in such event the director shall possess all powers formerly held by the board of directors of the association in the director's possession.\n\n7. Unless the director is enjoined from further proceedings and directed to surrender the business, property and assets of an association or unless such association shall with the consent of the director resume business or unless the director shall propose a merger or consolidation of the association, the director shall proceed to liquidate the affairs of the association as provided in section 369.349.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 3 § 68, A.L. 1982 S.B. 464, A.L. 1983 H.B. 570, A.L. 1984 S.B. 670 Revision, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1165)\n\nEffective 7-06-94",

When the director of the division of finance determines to liquidate an association, the director shall file a petition in the circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the association is located setting forth the facts. If the court finds that under the law the director is entitled to liquidate the association, the court shall thereupon appoint the director as receiver. The director shall cause an inventory of all the assets of the association to be filed with the court and shall cause notice to be given by publication, once a week, for four successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published at or near the principal place of business in the state of such association to all persons having claims against the association as creditors, or otherwise, requiring them to present and file their claims and make legal proof thereof at a place and within a time designated in such publication. The time shall be not less than six months after the first publication. Within ten days after the first publication, the director shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to all persons whose names appear of record upon the association's books as creditors.\n\n2. All claims, demands, or causes of action of creditors against the association or against any property owned or held by it in trust or otherwise must be presented to the director in writing, verified by the claimant or someone on the claimant's behalf, within the period specified in the notice for the presentation of claims whether or not an action is pending to enforce any such claim or demand. The director shall not approve any claim not so presented and any such claim, demand or cause of action not so presented is forever barred. Upon the expiration of the time fixed for the presentation of claims, the director shall prepare a full and complete schedule of all claims presented specifying by classes those that have been approved and those that have been disapproved and file the same with the court.\n\n3. Not later than five days after the time of filing the schedule of claims with the court, written notice shall be mailed to all claimants whose claims have been rejected. Petition to enforce the payment of or to establish any rejected claim must be filed in the liquidation proceeding and service had upon the director within four months from and after the date of filing of the schedule of claims or all such actions are forever barred.\n\n4. Any account holder without presenting a claim is entitled to any liquidating dividends declared, to the extent and in the proper relative order of priority, on any claim shown by the books of the association to exist in the account holder's favor against the association.\n\n5. Claims of creditors shall bear interest at the rate provided by law on judgments from the date the director takes possession of the business, property and assets of the association.\n\n6. The filing of the petition under subsection 1 operates to stay or dissolve all actions or attachments instituted or levied within thirty days next preceding the taking of possession of such association by the director under section 369.344 or under this section, and pending the process of liquidation, no attachment or execution shall be levied or lien created upon any of the property of the association.\n\n7. In liquidating the affairs of the association, the director may:\n\n(1) Take possession of all property and assets, collect all money due to and claims of the association and give receipt thereof;\n\n(2) Release or reconvey all real or personal property pledged, hypothecated or transferred in trust as security for loan;\n\n(3) Approve and pay all just and equitable claims;\n\n(4) Commence and prosecute all actions and proceedings necessary to enforce liquidation;\n\n(5) Compound bad or doubtful debts or claims, borrow money, sell, convey or transfer real or personal property on order of the court;\n\n(6) In the name of the association, or in the director's own name, prosecute and defend any suit or other legal proceeding;\n\n(7) In the name of the association, or in the director's own name as director, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all deeds, assignments, releases and other instruments necessary and proper to effectuate any sale of real or personal property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation of the association. Any deed, assignment, release or other instrument executed pursuant to this section is valid and effectual for all purposes as though it were executed by the officers of such association with the authority of its board of directors; and\n\n(8) With the approval of the court, abandon any bad or doubtful debt or claim on any property of the association.\n\n8. The director may appoint one or more special deputies to assist in the duties of liquidation and distribution and may also employ such special legal counsel, accountants and assistants as may be needed and required and fix their salaries and compensation subject to the approval of the court. All such salaries and compensation and such reasonable and necessary expenses as may be incurred in the liquidation shall be paid by the director from the funds of the association in the director's hands. Such expenses shall include that part of the salary of the director and of the director's deputies, examiners, accountants and other assistants and that part of the general expenses of the director's office as fairly represent, in the opinion of the director, the proportion properly attributable to such liquidation.\n\n9. From the net realization of assets, the director, subject to the approval of the court, shall pay dividends in liquidation to the creditors in order of preference. All remaining assets of a mutual association shall be distributed to the account holders in proportion to the amounts of their respective accounts as of the date liquidation began. All remaining assets of a capital stock association shall be distributed to the stockholders in accordance with their stock ownership.\n\n10. Any money due to but unclaimed by any person shall be deposited with the director. The owner, the owner's heirs or personal representative may claim any funds so deposited by proof of ownership satisfactory to the director at any time within ten years. Earnings on such funds during possession by the director shall be used to defray expenses of the director's office, and the owner, the owner's*heirs and personal representatives shall have no claim thereto. Money not so claimed in ten years shall be delivered to the state treasurer from whom the owner, the owner's heirs or personal representative may claim such funds upon proof of ownership satisfactory to the state treasurer.\n\n11. On the payment of a final dividend in liquidation, the director shall prepare and file with the court a full and final statement of liquidation including a summary of the receipts and disbursements which shall be filed with the court and in the office of the director. After hearing and approval by the court, the liquidation shall be closed. The order of the court approving the final settlement on liquidation shall provide for the destruction or other disposition of the books and records of the association or pertaining to the liquidation of the association, and the court may declare the association dissolved as a corporation. A copy of the order dissolving the association as a corporation shall be filed with the secretary of state.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 3 § 69, A.L. 1982 S.B. 464, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1165)\n\nEffective 7-06-94\n\n*Word \"director's\" appears in original rolls.",
