In case a corporation is authorized by its articles of incorporation to issue preferred shares entitled to limited preferential dividends and to a limited amount on dissolution or liquidation, the board of directors may, if expressly authorized so to do by the articles of incorporation, and with the written approval of the director of the department of commerce and insurance, cause such shares to be issued from time to time in series and may, to the extent expressly authorized by such articles of incorporation, by resolution adopted prior to the issue of shares of a particular series, fix the distinctive serial designation of the shares of such series, the dividend rate thereof, the date from which dividends on shares issued prior to date for payment of the first dividend thereon shall be cumulative, the redemption price and the terms of redemption, the amounts payable thereon on dissolution or liquidation and the terms and amount of any sinking fund for the purchase or redemption thereof, and the terms and conditions, if any, under which said shares may be converted; and in respect of the terms so fixed by the board of directors, the shares of a particular series may vary from those of any or all other series, but only in respects and within the limits, if any, set forth in the articles of incorporation; and, except as so varied by the board of directors, all of the shares of the same class, regardless of series, shall in all respects be equal and shall have the preferences, rights, privileges and restrictions fixed by the articles of incorporation. Before the issue of any preferred shares of any series, the number of shares of such series and the designation, description and terms thereof fixed by the board of directors pursuant to such authority shall be set forth in a certificate signed and verified by the president or a vice president and countersigned by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, which certificates shall be filed with the director of the department of commerce and insurance and secretary of state and otherwise dealt with as in the case of articles of incorporation.\n\n3.

In the case of a mutual insurance company, notice, including the time and place at which such meeting will be held, may, in lieu of such written or printed notice, be given by publication made by the company in two daily newspapers, one of which shall be published in the City of St. Louis or the city of Kansas City, for at least once a week for two weeks before the time appointed for the meeting.\n\n(3) At the meeting a vote of those entitled to vote shall be taken on the proposed amendment. The proposed amendment shall be adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of all of those entitled to vote at the meeting either in person or by proxy or may be adopted upon a specified vote if contained in the articles or other provision of law which shall not be less than a majority; except that in the case of a mutual insurance company, the proposed amendment shall be adopted upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting at the meeting in person or by proxy.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 516)",

Credit shall be allowed pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit shall be allowed pursuant to subdivision (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection only if the applicable requirements of subdivision (8) have been satisfied.\n\n(1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is licensed to transact insurance in this state.\n\n(2) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the director as a reinsurer in this state. In order to be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall:\n\n(a) File with the director evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction;\n\n(b) Submit to the authority of the department of commerce and insurance to examine its books and records;\n\n(c) Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;\n\n(d) File annually with the director a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and\n\n(e) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet such requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus regarding policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars and its accreditation has not been denied by the director within ninety days after submission of its application.\n\n(3) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this statute and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:\n\n(a) Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars; except that this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system; and\n\n(b) Submits to the authority of the department of commerce and insurance to examine its books and records.\n\n(4) (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. To enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the director information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' annual statement form by licensed insurers. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the director.\n\n(b) Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted pursuant to this subdivision unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by:\n\na. The commissioner or director of the state agency regulating insurance in the state where the trust is domiciled; or\n\nb. The commissioner or director of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.\n\n(c) The form of the trust and any trust amendments shall also be filed with the commissioner or director in every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the director.\n\n(d) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No later than February twenty-eighth of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the next following December thirty-first.\n\n(e) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers:\n\na. The trust fund for a single assuming insurer shall consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by the United States ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars, except as provided in subparagraph b. of this paragraph;\n\nb. At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the director with principal regulator oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding based on an assessment of risk that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus shall not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust;\n\nc. In the case of a group of incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:\n\n(i) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group;\n\n(ii) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 31, 1992, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the trust shall consist of a trustee account in an amount not less than the respective underwriter's several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business in the United States; and\n\n(iii) In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account;\n\nd. The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members;\n\ne. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group.\n\n(5) (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the director as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision.\n\n(b) In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements:\n\na. The assuming insurer shall be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director under paragraph (d) of this subdivision;\n\nb. The assuming insurer shall maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the director by rule;\n\nc. The assuming insurer shall maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the director by rule;\n\nd. The assuming insurer shall agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the director as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;\n\ne. The assuming insurer shall agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the director, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and\n\nf. The assuming insurer shall satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the director.\n\n(c) An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. To be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying requirements of paragraph (b) of this subdivision:\n\na. The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the director to provide adequate protection;\n\nb. The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and\n\nc. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the director:\n\n(i) An annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or\n\n(ii) If a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each underwriter member of the association.\n\n(d) a. The director shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the director as a certified reinsurer.\n\nb. To determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the director shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the director with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction shall not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the director has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered at the discretion of the director.\n\nc. The director may consider a list of qualified jurisdictions published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in determining qualified jurisdictions for the purposes of this section. If the director approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the director shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed by rule.\n\nd. United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.\n\ne. If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the director has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.\n\n(e) The director shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the director by rule. The director shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.\n\n(f) a. A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this subdivision at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the director.\n\nb. For a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the director and consistent with the provisions of this section or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with paragraph (e) of subdivision (4) of this subsection, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision.\n\nc. If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations under paragraph (d) of subdivision (4) of this subsection and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subsection or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to paragraph (e) of subdivision (4) of this subsection. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the director with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.\n\nd. The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (e) of subdivision (4) of this subsection are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this paragraph, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars.\n\ne. With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this paragraph, if the security is insufficient, the director shall order the certified reinsurer to provide sufficient security for such incurred obligations within thirty days. If a certified reinsurer does not provide sufficient security for its obligations incurred under this subsection within thirty days of being ordered to do so by the director, the director has the discretion to allow credit in the amount of the required security for one year. Following this one-year period, the director shall impose reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.\n\nf. (i) For purposes of this paragraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations.\n\n(ii) As used in this subparagraph, the term\"terminated\"refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.\n\n(iii) If the director continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this subdivision, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.\n\ng. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC-accredited jurisdiction, the director has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification and to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.\n\nh. A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the director shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.\n\n(6) Credit:\n\n(a) Shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below:\n\na. The assuming insurer shall have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction. A\"reciprocal jurisdiction\"is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:\n\n(i) A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this subdivision, a\"covered agreement\"is an agreement entered into pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. Sections 313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program; or\n\n(iii) A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision (5) of this subsection, that and which is not otherwise described in item (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph and that and which meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the director by rule;\n\nb. The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth by rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable to its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth by rule;\n\nc. The assuming insurer shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, that and which shall be set forth by rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it shall have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed;\n\nd. The assuming insurer shall agree and provide adequate assurance to the director, in a form specified by the director by rule, as follows:\n\n(i) The assuming insurer shall provide prompt written notice and explanation to the director if it falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subparagraph**b. or c. of this paragraph, or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;\n\n(ii) The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the director as agent for service of process. The director may require that consent for service of process be provided to the director and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this provision shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;\n\n(iii) The assuming insurer shall consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have***been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained;\n\n(iv) Each reinsurance agreement shall include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and\n\n(v) The assuming insurer shall confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that and which involves this state's ceding insurers and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the director and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of subdivision (5) of this subsection and subsection 2 of this section and as specified by the director by rule;\n\ne. The assuming insurer or its legal successor shall provide, if requested by the director, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the director, as specified by the director by rule;\n\nf. The assuming insurer shall maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth by rule;\n\ng. The assuming insurer's supervisory authority shall confirm to the director on an annual basis, as of the preceding December thirty-first or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in subparagraphs b. and c. of this paragraph;\n\nh. Nothing in this subdivision precludes an assuming insurer from providing the director with information on a voluntary basis.\n\n(b) a. The director shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions;\n\nb. A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the NAIC committee process. The director's list shall include any reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under items (i) and (ii) of subparagraph a. of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, and shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the NAIC list. The director may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under rules promulgated by the director; and\n\nc. The director may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process set forth by rule promulgated by the director, except that the director shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined under items****(i) and (ii) of subparagraph a. of paragraph (a) of this subdivision. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from this list credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that and which has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed under this section.\n\n(c) The director shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this subdivision and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this subdivision. The director may add an assuming insurer to such list if an NAIC accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the director as required under subparagraph d. of paragraph (a) of this subdivision and complies with any additional requirements that the director may adopt by rule, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.\n\n(d) a. If the director determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subdivision, the director may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this subdivision in accordance with procedures set forth by rule;\n\nb. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection 2 of this section; and\n\nc. If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and consistent with the provisions of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(e) If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.\n\n(f) Nothing in this subdivision shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this section or other applicable law or regulation.\n\n(g) a. Credit may be taken under this subdivision only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed on or after December 31, 2021, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later: of the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements under paragraph (a) of this subdivision; or the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal;\n\nb. This paragraph shall not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this subdivision, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this section;\n\nc. Nothing in this subdivision shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement, except as permitted by the terms of the agreement; and\n\nd. Nothing in this subdivision shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.\n\n(7) Credit:\n\n(a) Shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subdivision (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection, but only as to the insurance of risks located in a jurisdiction of the United States where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction;\n\n(b) May be allowed in the discretion of the director when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subdivision (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection, but only as to the insurance of risks located in a foreign country where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that country.\n\n(8) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited, or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:\n\n(a) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer shall submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, will comply with all requirements necessary to give such courts jurisdiction, and will abide by the final decisions of such courts or of any appellate courts in this state in the event of an appeal; and\n\n(b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer. This paragraph is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement and the jurisdiction and situs of the arbitration is, with respect to any receivership of the ceding company, any jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n(9) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, the credit permitted by subdivision (4) or (5) of this subsection shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the amount required by paragraph (e) of subdivision (4) of this subsection, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the commissioner or director with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commissioner or director with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund;\n\n(b) The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the commissioner or director with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies;\n\n(c) If the commissioner or director with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof shall be returned by the commissioner or director with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement; and\n\n(d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.\n\n(10) (a) If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the director may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification.\n\n(b) The director shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for a hearing. The suspension or revocation shall not take effect until after the director's order on hearing, unless:\n\na. The reinsurer waives its right to hearing;\n\nb. The director's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subdivision (5) of this subsection; or\n\nc. The director finds that an emergency requires immediate action, and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.\n\n(c) While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subdivision (5) of this subsection or subsection 2 of this section. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance shall be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subdivision (5) of this subsection or subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(11) (a) A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers exceeds fifty percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers is likely to exceed such limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.\n\n(b) A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after ceding to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers more than twenty percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers is likely to exceed such limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.\n\n2. An asset or reduction from liability for the reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection 1 of this section shall be allowed in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer; provided further, that the director may adopt by rule pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section, specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section or the circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated. The reduction shall be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer, under a reinsurance contract with the assuming insurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the security is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by, and under the exclusive control of, the ceding insurer; or, in the case of a trust, held in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section. This security may be in the form of:\n\n(2) Securities listed by the securities valuation office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, including those deemed exempt from filing as defined by the Purposes and Procedures Manual of the Securities Valuation Office, and qualifying as admitted assets;\n\n(3) (a) Clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit issued or confirmed by a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section, no later than December thirty-first of the year for which filing is being made, and in the possession of, or in trust for, the ceding insurer on or before the filing date of its annual statement.\n\n(b) Letters of credit meeting applicable standards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of their issuance or confirmation, notwithstanding the issuing or confirming institution's subsequent failure to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability, shall continue to be acceptable as security until their expiration, extension, renewal, modification or amendment, whichever first occurs;\n\n(4) Any other form of security acceptable to the director.\n\n3. (1) For purposes of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, a\"qualified United States financial institution\"means an institution that:\n\n(a) Is organized or, in the case of a United States office of a foreign banking organization, licensed under the laws of the United States or any state thereof;\n\n(b) Is regulated, supervised and examined by federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies; and\n\n(c) Has been determined by either the director, or the securities valuation office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to meet such standards of financial condition and standing as are considered necessary and appropriate to regulate the quality of financial institutions whose letters of credit will be acceptable to the director.\n\n(2) A\"qualified United States financial institution\"means, for purposes of those provisions of this law specifying those institutions that are eligible to act as a fiduciary of a trust, an institution that:\n\n(a) Is organized, or in the case of a United States branch or agency office of a foreign banking organization, licensed under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and has been granted authority to operate with fiduciary powers; and\n\n(b) Is regulated, supervised and examined by federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies.\n\n4. (1) The director may adopt rules and regulations implementing the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) (a) The director is further authorized to adopt rules and regulations applicable to reinsurance arrangements described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.\n\n(b) A rule adopted under this subdivision may apply only to reinsurance relating to:\n\na. Life insurance policies with guaranteed nonlevel gross premiums or guaranteed nonlevel benefits;\n\nb. Universal life insurance policies with provisions resulting in the ability of a policyholder to keep a policy in force over a secondary guarantee period;\n\nc. Variable annuities with guaranteed death or living benefits;\n\nd. Long-term care insurance policies; or\n\ne. Such other life and health insurance and annuity products as to which the NAIC adopts model regulatory requirements with respect to credit for reinsurance.\n\n(c) A rule adopted under subparagraph**a. or b. of paragraph (b) of this subdivision may apply to any treaty containing policies issued on or after January 1, 2015, or policies issued prior to January 1, 2015, if risk pertaining to such pre-2015 policies is ceded in connection with the treaty, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 2015.\n\n(d) A rule adopted under this subdivision may require the ceding insurer, in calculating the amounts or forms of security required to be held under rules promulgated under this authority, to use the valuation manual adopted in accordance with subsection 6 of section 376.380, including all amendments adopted thereto and in effect on the date as of which the calculation is made, to the extent applicable.\n\n(e) A regulation adopted under this subdivision shall not apply to cessions to an assuming insurer that:\n\na. Meets the conditions set forth in subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this section, or if this state has not fully implemented provisions substantially equivalent to subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this section by rule or otherwise, the assuming insurer is operating in accordance with provisions substantially equivalent to subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this section in a minimum of five other states;\n\nb. Is certified in this state; or\n\nc. Maintains at least two hundred fifty million dollars in capital and surplus when determined in accordance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, including all amendments thereto adopted by the NAIC, excluding the impact of any permitted or prescribed practices, and is:\n\n(i) Licensed in at least twenty-six states; or\n\n(ii) Licensed in at least ten states, and licensed or accredited in a total of at least thirty-five states.\n\n(f) The authority to adopt regulations under this subdivision does not limit the director's general authority to adopt regulations under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n5. (1) The director shall disallow any credit as an asset or as a deduction from liability for any reinsurance found by him to have been arranged for the purpose principally of deception as to the ceding company's financial condition as of the date of any financial statement of the company. Without limiting the general purport of this provision, reinsurance of any substantial part of the company's outstanding risks contracted for in fact within four months prior to the date of any such financial statement and cancelled in fact within four months after the date of such statement, or reinsurance under which the assuming insurer bears no substantial insurance risk or substantial risk of net loss to itself, shall prima facie be deemed to have been arranged for the purpose principally of deception within the intent of this provision.\n\n(2) (a) The director shall also disallow as an asset or deduction from liability to any ceding insurer any credit for reinsurance unless the reinsurance is payable to the ceding company, and if it be insolvent to its receiver, by the assuming insurer on the basis of the liability of the ceding company under the contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding company.\n\n(b) Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except:\n\na. Where the contract of insurance or reinsurance specifically provides for payment to the named insured, assignee or named beneficiary of the policy issued by the ceding insurer in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or\n\nb. Where the assuming insurer, with the consent of it and the direct insured or insureds in an assumption reinsurance transaction subject to sections 375.1280 to 375.1295, has assumed such policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision, in the event that a life and health insurance guaranty association has made the election to succeed to the rights and obligations of the insolvent insurer under the contract of reinsurance, then the reinsurer's liability to pay covered reinsured claims shall continue under the contract of reinsurance, subject to the payment to the reinsurer of the reinsurance premiums for such coverage. Payment for such reinsured claims shall only be made by the reinsurer pursuant to the direction of the guaranty association or its designated successor. Any payment made at the direction of the guaranty association or its designated successor by the reinsurer will discharge the reinsurer of all further liability to any other party for such claim payment.\n\n(d) The reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against such ceding insurer on the contract reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding. During the pendency of such claim, any assuming insurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defenses which it deems available to the ceding insurer, or its liquidator. Such expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. Where two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose a defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though such expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer.\n\n6. To the extent that any reinsurer of an insurance company in liquidation would have been required under any agreement pertaining to reinsurance to post letters of credit or other security prior to an order of liquidation to cover such reserves reflected upon the last financial statement filed with a regulatory authority immediately prior to receivership, such reinsurer shall be required to post letters of credit or other security to cover reserves after a company has been placed in liquidation or receivership. If a reinsurer shall fail to post letters of credit or other security as required by a reinsurance agreement or the provisions of this subsection, the director may consider disallowing as a credit or asset, in whole or in part, any future reinsurance ceded to such reinsurer by a ceding insurance company that is incorporated under the laws of the state of Missouri.\n\n7. The provisions of section 375.420 shall not apply to any action, suit or proceeding by a ceding insurer against an assuming insurer arising out of a contract of reinsurance effectuated in accordance with the laws of Missouri.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a domestic insurer may take credit for reinsurance ceded either as an asset or a reduction from liability only to the extent such credit is allowed by the consistent application of either applicable statutory accounting principles adopted by the NAIC or other accounting principles approved by the director.\n\n9. The director may suspend the accreditation, approval, or certification under subsection 1 of this section of any reinsurer for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of subsection 1 of this section after providing the affected reinsurer with notice and opportunity for hearing.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 516, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1739, A.L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al., A.L. 1994 H.B. 1449 merged with S.B. 687, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1568, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1253 merged with S.B. 1235, A.L. 2013 H.B. 133, A.L. 2021 H.B. 604 merged with S.B. 6)\n\n*Word \"subdivisions\" appears in original rolls of H.B. 604 and S.B. 6, 2021.\n\n**Word \"subparagraphs\" appears in original rolls of H.B. 604 and S.B. 6, 2021.\n\n***Word \"has\" appears in original rolls of S.B. 6, 2021.\n\n****Word \"item\" appears in original rolls of H.B. 604 and S.B. 6, 2021.",

The following standards, either singly or a combination of two or more, may be considered by the director to determine whether the continued operation of any insurer transacting an insurance business in this state might be deemed to be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, or the general public:\n\n(1) Adverse findings reported in financial condition and market conduct examination reports, audit reports, and actuarial opinions, reports, or summaries;\n\n(2) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners Insurance Regulatory Information System and its other financial analysis solvency tools and reports;\n\n(3) Whether the insurer has made adequate provision, according to presently accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer, when considered in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on such assets, and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under such policies and contracts;\n\n(4) The ability of an assuming reinsurer to perform and whether the insurer's reinsurance program provides sufficient protection for the insurer's remaining surplus after taking into account the insurer's cash flow and the classes of business written as well as the financial condition of the assuming reinsurer;\n\n(5) Whether the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, including but not limited to net capital gain or loss, change in nonadmitted assets, and cash dividends paid to shareholders, is greater than fifty percent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards to policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\n(6) Whether the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve-month period or any shorter period of time, excluding net capital gains, is greater than twenty percent of the insurer's remaining surplus as regards to policyholders in excess of the minimum required;\n\n(7) Whether a reinsurer, obligor, or any entity within the insurer's insurance holding company system, is insolvent, threatened with insolvency or delinquent in payment of its monetary or other obligations, and which in the opinion of the director may affect the solvency of the insurer;\n\n(8) Contingent liabilities, pledges, or guaranties which either individually or collectively involve a total amount which in the opinion of the director may affect the solvency of the insurer;\n\n(9) Whether any controlling person of an insurer is delinquent in the transmitting to, or payment of, net premiums to the insurer.

For the purposes of making a determination of an insurer's financial condition under this section, the director may:\n\n(1) Disregard any credit or amount receivable resulting from transactions with a reinsurer that is insolvent, impaired, or otherwise subject to a delinquency proceeding;\n\n(2) Make appropriate adjustments including disallowance to asset values attributable to investments in or transactions with parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates consistent with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual, state laws and regulations;\n\n(3) Refuse to recognize the stated value of accounts receivable if the ability to collect receivables is highly speculative in view of the age of the account or the financial condition of the debtor;\n\n(4) Increase the insurer's liability in an amount equal to any contingent liability, pledge, or guarantee not otherwise included if there is a substantial risk that the insurer will be called upon to meet the obligation undertaken within the next twelve-month period.\n\n4.

The notice of hearing shall state the time and place of hearing and the conduct, condition, or ground upon which the director based the order.

The association shall be obligated to the extent of the covered claims existing prior to the date of a final order of liquidation or a judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in the insurer's domiciliary state that an insolvent insurer exists and arising within thirty days from the date or at the time of the first such order or determination, or before the policy expiration date if less than thirty days after such date, or before or at the time the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if he does so within thirty days of such date. Such obligation shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows:\n\n(1) The full amount of a covered claim for benefits under workers' compensation insurance coverage;\n\n(2) An amount not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars per policy for a covered claim for the return of unearned premium;\n\n(3) An amount not exceeding three hundred thousand dollars per claim for all other covered claims.\n\n2. In no event shall the association be obligated to an insured or claimant in an amount in excess of the face amount or the limits of the policy from which a claim arises or be obligated for the payment of unearned premium in excess of the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, or to an insured or claimant on any covered claim until it receives confirmation from the receiver or liquidator of an insolvent insurer that the claim is within the coverage of an applicable policy of the insolvent insurer, except that within the sole discretion of the association, if the association deems it has sufficient evidence from other sources, including any claim forms which may be propounded by the association, that the claim is within the coverage of an applicable policy of the insolvent insurer, it shall proceed to process the claim, pursuant to its statutory obligations, without such confirmation by the receiver or liquidator:\n\n(1) All covered claims shall be filed with the association on the claim information form required by this subdivision no later than the final date first set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer, except that if the time first set by the court for filing claims is one year or less from the date of insolvency, and an extension of the time to file claims is granted by the court, claims may be filed with the association no later than the new date set by the court or within one year of the date of insolvency, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the association be obligated on a claim filed after such date or on one not filed on the required form. A claim information form shall consist of a statement verified under oath by the claimant which includes all of the following:\n\n(a) The particulars of the claim;\n\n(b) A statement that the sum claimed is justly owing and that there is no setoff, counterclaim, or defense to said claim;\n\n(c) The name and address of the claimant and the attorney who represents the claimant, if any; and\n\n(d) If the claimant is an insured, that the insured's net worth did not exceed twenty-five million dollars on the date the insurer became an insolvent insurer.­­The association may require that a prescribed form be used and may require that other information and documents be included.

All covered claims shall be filed with the association, liquidator or receiver. Notwithstanding any other provisions of sections 375.771 to 375.779, a covered claim shall not include a claim filed after the earlier of eighteen months after the date of the order of liquidation, or the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. The association may require that other information and documents be included in confirming the existence of a covered claim or in determining eligibility of any claimant. Such information may include, but is not limited to:\n\n(a) The particulars of the claim;\n\n(b) A statement that the sum claimed is justly owing and that there is no setoff, counterclaim, or defense to said claim;\n\n(c) The name and address of the claimant and the attorney who represents the claimant, if any; and\n\n(d) A verification under oath of such requested information.­­In no event shall the association be obligated on a claim filed with the association, liquidator or receiver for protection afforded under the insured's policy for incurred but not reported losses.

In the case of claims arising from bodily injury, sickness or disease, the amount of any such award shall not exceed the claimant's reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray, dental services and comparable services for individuals who, in the exercise of their constitutional rights, rely on spiritual means alone for healing in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner thereof, including prosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing, and any amounts lost or to be lost by reason of claimant's inability to work and earn wages or salary or their equivalent, except that the association shall pay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workers' compensation policy. Such award may also include payments in fact made to others, not members of claimant's household, which were reasonably incurred to obtain from such other persons ordinary and necessary services for the production of income in lieu of those services the claimant would have performed for himself had he not been injured. Verdicts as respect only those civil actions as may be brought to recover damages as provided in this section shall specifically set out the sums applicable to each item in this section for which an award may be made.\n\n4. In the case of claims arising from a member insurer subject to a final order of liquidation dated on or after August 31, 2004, the provisions of subsection 3 of this section shall not apply.\n\n5. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 375.771 to 375.779, except in the case of a claim for benefits under workers' compensation coverage, any obligation of the association to or on behalf of the insured and its affiliates on covered claims shall cease when ten million dollars has been paid in the aggregate by the association and any one or more associations similar to the association in any other state or states to or on behalf of such insured, its affiliates, and additional insureds on covered claims or allowed claims arising under the policy or policies of any one insolvent insurer.\n\n6. If the association determines that there may be more than one claimant having a covered claim or allowed claim against the association, or any associations similar to the association in other states, under the policy or policies of any one solvent insurer, the association may establish a plan to allocate amounts payable by the association in such manner as the association in its discretion deems equitable.\n\n7. The association shall be deemed the insurer only to the extent of its obligations on the covered claims and to such extent, subject to the limitations provided in sections 375.771 to 375.779, shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent, including but not limited to the right to pursue and retain salvage and subrogation recoverable on paid covered claim obligations. The association shall not be deemed the insolvent insurer for any purpose relating to the issue of whether the association is amenable to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of any states. However, any obligation to defend an insured shall cease upon:\n\n(1) The association's payment by settlement releasing the insured or on a judgment of an amount equal to the lesser of the association's covered claim obligation limit or the applicable policy limit; or\n\n(2) The association's tender of such amount.\n\n8. The association shall allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the four accounts separately, and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay the obligations of the association under subsection 1 of this section to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, the cost of examinations under subdivision (3) of subsection 9 of this section, and other expenses authorized by sections 375.771 to 375.779. The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year of the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member insurer's assessment may be rounded to the nearest ten dollars. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than two percent of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. The association may defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. Deferred assessments shall be paid when such payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. Such payments shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments by virtue of such deferment, or, in the discretion of any such company, credited against future assessments. No dividends shall be paid stockholders or policyholders of a member insurer so long as all or part of any assessment against such insurer remains deferred. Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made. Assessments made under sections 375.771 to 375.779 and section 375.916 shall not be subject to subsection 1 of section 375.916.\n\n9. The association shall:\n\n(1) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the director, but such designation may be declined by a member insurer;\n\n(2) Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility and for actual expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this section;\n\n(3) Be subject to examination and regulation by the director. The board of directors shall submit, not later than March thirtieth of each year, a financial report for the preceding calendar year in a form approved by the director; and\n\n(4) Proceed to investigate, settle, and determine covered claims.\n\n10. The association may:\n\n(1) Appear in, defend and appeal any action on a claim brought against the association;\n\n(2) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the association;\n\n(3) Act as a servicing facility for other similar entities created by similar laws in this state or other states;\n\n(4) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of sections 375.771 to 375.779 in accord with the plan of operation;\n\n(5) Sue or be sued. Such power to sue includes the power and right to intervene as a party before any court that has jurisdiction over an insolvent insurer as defined in section 375.772;\n\n(6) Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to carry out the purpose of sections 375.771 to 375.779;\n\n(7) Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of sections 375.771 to 375.779;\n\n(8) Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of the association in any account exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year; and\n\n(9) Become a member of the National Conference on Insurance Guaranty Funds.\n\n(L. 1989 S.B. 333, A.L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al., A.L. 2002 H.B. 1468, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1299, A.L. 2013 S.B. 59)",

Such other policies of insurance shall include, but not be limited to, liability coverage, health and accident insurance, hospitalization and other medical expense coverage, health care coverage by a health maintenance organization or health services corporation, or any amount payable by or on behalf of a self-insured plan, workers' compensation benefits, disability insurance, uninsured motorist coverage, and underinsured motorist coverage. The association's obligation pursuant to subsection 1 of section 375.775 shall be reduced by the amount recovered or recoverable, whichever is greater under any such other insurance policy or policies.

As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Adverse action\", a denial, nonrenewal of, or a reduction in the amount of benefits payable or types of coverages under any contract, existing or applied for, in connection with the underwriting of insurance. An offer by an insurer to write a contract through an affiliated insurer does not constitute an adverse action;\n\n(2)\"Contract\", any automobile insurance policy as defined in section 379.110, or any property insurance policy as defined in section 375.001, including such a policy on a mobile home or residential condominium unit or a policy of renters' or tenants' insurance. Contract shall not include any policy of mortgage insurance or commercial insurance;\n\n(3)\"Credit report\", any written or electronic communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency that:\n\n(a) Bears on a person's credit worthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity; and\n\n(b) Is used or collected wholly or partly to serve as a factor in the underwriting of a contract;\n\n(4)\"Credit scoring entity\", any entity that is involved in creating, compiling, or providing insurance credit scores;\n\n(5)\"Insurance credit score\", a numerical representation of the insurance risk a person presents using the person's attributes derived from a credit report or credit information in a formula to assess insurance risk on an actuarial or statistical basis;\n\n(6)\"Insurer\", any insurance company or entity that offers a contract;\n\n(7)\"Underwriting\", the selection of the risk that will be assumed by the insurer on a contract, and specifically the decision whether to accept, deny, renew, nonrenew, reduce, or increase the amount of benefits payable or types of coverages under the contract.\n\n2. An insurer using a credit report or insurance credit score as a factor in underwriting shall not take an adverse action based on such factor without consideration of another noncredit-related underwriting factor.\n\n3. No insurer shall take an adverse action against an applicant or insured based on inability to compute an insurance credit score without consideration of another underwriting factor, unless the insurer can justify the credibility that the lack of an insurance credit score has in underwriting to the director of the department of commerce and insurance.\n\n4. An insurer using a credit report or insurance credit score as a factor in underwriting a contract shall disclose at the time of the original application for the contract or on the application itself that the insurer may gather credit information.\n\n5. An insurer using a credit report or insurance credit score as a factor in underwriting of a contract shall not take an adverse action on such contract based on information that is the subject of a written dispute between the policyholder or applicant and a consumer reporting agency, as noted in such person's credit report, until such dispute has reached final determination in accordance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq. In the event that information is the subject of a written dispute under this subsection, the sixty-day period provided by section 375.002 or section 379.110 shall be extended until fifteen days after the dispute reaches final determination. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any consumer reporting agency, as defined by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq., to include any information on a credit report beyond the extent required by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq.\n\n6. If the use of a credit report or insurance credit score on a contract results in an adverse action, the insurer shall provide the policyholder or applicant:\n\n(1) Notice that a credit report or insurance credit score adversely affected the underwriting of the contract;\n\n(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the consumer credit reporting agency that furnished the credit information, in compliance with the notice requirements of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq.;\n\n(3) Notice of the right to obtain a free credit report from the consumer credit reporting agency within sixty days; and\n\n(4) Notice of the right to lodge a dispute with the consumer credit reporting agency to have any erroneous information corrected in accordance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq.\n\n7. Within thirty days from the date the insurer provides notice of an adverse action pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 6 of this section, the applicant or insured may in writing request from the insurer a statement of reasons for such action. For purposes of determining the thirty-day period, the notice of an adverse action is deemed received three days after mailing. The statement of reasons shall be sufficiently clear and specific so that a person of average intelligence can identify the basis for the insurer's decision without further inquiry. An insurer may provide an explanation of significant characteristics of the credit history that may have impacted such person's insurance credit score to meet the requirements of this subsection. Standardized credit explanations provided by credit scoring entities comply with this subsection.\n\n8. If an insurer bases an adverse action in part on a credit report or insurance credit score, the applicant or insured may within thirty days of such adverse action make a written request for reunderwriting following any correction relating to the credit report or insurance credit score.\n\n9. An insurer may obtain and use a current credit report or insurance credit score on new business or renewal contracts, but shall not take an adverse action with respect to renewal contracts based upon such credit report or insurance credit score until or after the third anniversary date of the initial contract.\n\n10. Insurance inquiries shall not directly or indirectly be used as a negative factor in any insurance credit scoring formula or in the use of a credit report in underwriting.\n\n11. Nothing in this section shall be construed as superceding the provisions of section 375.002 and section 379.114. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting any insurer from using credit information in determining whether to offer a policyholder or applicant the option to finance or establish a payment plan for the payment of any premium for a contract. Nothing in this section shall apply to any entity not acting as an insurer or credit scoring entity as defined in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n12. No credit scoring entity shall provide or sell to any party, other than the insurer, its insurance company affiliates or holding companies, and the producer from whom the inquiry was generated, data or lists that include any information that in whole or in part is submitted in conjunction with credit inquiries about consumers. Such information includes, but is not limited to, expiration dates, information that may identify time periods during which a consumer's insurance may expire, or other nonpublic personal information as defined under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 6801 to 6809. The provisions of this subsection shall not preclude the exchange of information specifically authorized under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1681, et seq., the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 6801 to 6809 and other applicable federal law. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to data disclosed in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer or exchange of all or a portion of an insurer's or producer's business or operating unit, including but not limited to, the sale of a portfolio of contracts, if such disclosure concerns solely consumers of the business or unit and such disclosure is not the primary reason for the sale, merger, transfer or exchange.\n\n13. A violation of this section may be enforceable under section 374.280.\n\n14.

No person who lends money or extends credit may:\n\n(1) Unreasonably reject a contract of insurance furnished by the borrower for the protection of the property securing the credit or lien. A rejection shall not be deemed unreasonable if it is based on reasonable standards, uniformly applied, relating to the extent of coverage required and the financial soundness and the services of an insurer. Such standards shall not discriminate against any particular type of insurer, nor shall such standards call for rejection of an insurance contract because the contract contains coverage in addition to that required in the credit transaction;\n\n(2) Require that any borrower, mortgagor, purchaser, insurer, broker or agent pay a separate charge, in connection with the handling of any contract of insurance required as security for a loan on real estate, or pay a separate charge to substitute the insurance policy of one insurer for that of another. This subdivision does not include the interest which may be charged on premium loans or premium advancements in accordance with the terms of the loan or credit documents;\n\n(3) Use or disclose, without the prior written consent of the borrower, mortgagor, or purchaser taken at a time other than the making of the loan or extension of credit, information relative to a contract of insurance which is required by the credit transaction, for the purpose of replacing such insurance;\n\n(4) Require any procedures or conditions of duly licensed agents, brokers or insurers not customarily required of those agents, brokers or insurers affiliated or in any way connected with the person who lends money or extends credit;\n\n(5) Solicit insurance for the protection of real property, after a person indicates interest in securing a first mortgage credit extension, until such person has received a commitment in writing from the lender as to a loan or credit extension;\n\n(6) As a condition of financing a residential mortgage or providing other financial arrangements for residential property, require a borrower to purchase homeowners' insurance coverage in an amount exceeding the replacement value of the improvements and contents on the real property. A violation of this subdivision shall not affect the validity of the loan, note secured by a deed of trust, mortgage, or deed of trust.\n\n3. Every person who lends money or extends credit and who solicits insurance on real and personal property subject to subsection 2 of this section must explain to the borrower in writing that the insurance related to such credit extension may be purchased from an insurer or agent of the borrower's choice, subject only to the lender's right to reject a given insurer or agent as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of this section. Compliance with disclosures as to insurance required by truth-in-lending laws or comparable state laws shall be in compliance with this subsection. This requirement for a commitment shall not apply in cases where the premium for the required insurance is to be financed as part of the loan or extension of credit involving personal property transactions.

Except as otherwise provided in sections 375.1025 to 375.1062, the director shall recognize an independent certified public accountant as qualified as long as he or she conforms to the standards of his or her profession, as contained in the code of professional ethics of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and rules and regulations and code of ethics and rules of professional conduct of the Missouri state board of accountancy, or similar code.\n\n3. The lead or coordinating audit partner or person having primary responsibility for the audit shall not act in that capacity for more than five consecutive years. Such partner or person shall be disqualified from acting in that or a similar capacity for the same company or its insurance subsidiaries or affiliates for a period of five years. An insurer may make application to the director for relief from the above rotation requirement on the basis of unusual circumstances. Such application shall be made at least thirty days before the end of the calendar year. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval, if any, for relief from this subsection with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and with the NAIC. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC. The director may consider the following factors in determining if the relief should be granted:\n\n(1) Number of partners, expertise of the partners or the number of insurance clients in the currently registered firm;\n\n(2) Premium volume of the insurer; or\n\n(3) Number of jurisdictions in which the insurer transacts business.\n\n4. The director shall neither recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept any annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by any natural person who:\n\n(1) Has been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961 to 1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices under federal law or the laws of any state;\n\n(2) Has been found to have violated the laws of this state with respect to any previous audited financial report submitted pursuant to sections 375.1025 to 375.1062; or\n\n(3) Has demonstrated a pattern or practice of failing to detect or disclose material information in previous reports filed under the provisions of sections 375.1025 to 375.1062.\n\n5. The director may hold a hearing under sections 536.100 to 536.140 to determine whether an independent certified public accountant is qualified and, considering the evidence presented, may rule that the accountant is not qualified for purposes of expressing his or her opinion on the financial statements in the annual audited financial report made pursuant to sections 375.1025 to 375.1062 and require the insurer to replace the accountant with another whose relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of sections 375.1025 to 375.1062.\n\n6. A qualified independent certified public accountant may enter into an agreement with an insurer to have disputes relating to an audit resolved by mediation or arbitration. However, in the event of a delinquency proceeding commenced against the insurer under sections 375.570 to 375.750, the mediation or arbitration provisions shall operate at the option of the statutory successor.\n\n7. The director shall not recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept an annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by an accountant who functions in the role of management, audits his or her own work, or serves in an advocacy role for the insurer. Without limiting the foregoing, the director shall not recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept an annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by an accountant who provides to an insurer, contemporaneously with the audit, the following nonaudit services:\n\n(1) Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the insurer;\n\n(2) Financial information systems design and implementation;\n\n(3) Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports;\n\n(4) Actuarially oriented advisory services involving the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statements. The accountant may assist an insurer in understanding the methods, assumptions, and inputs used in the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statement only if it is reasonable to conclude that the services provided will not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the insurer's financial statements. An accountant's actuary may also issue an actuarial opinion or certification (opinion) on an insurer's reserves if the following conditions have been met:\n\n(a) Neither the accountant nor the accountant's actuary has performed any management functions or made any management decisions;\n\n(b) The insurer has competent personnel (or engages a third-party actuary) to estimate the reserves for which management takes responsibility; and\n\n(c) The accountant's actuary tests the reasonableness of the reserves after the insurer's management has determined the amount of the reserves;\n\n(5) Internal audit outsourcing services;\n\n(6) Management functions or human resources;\n\n(7) Broker or dealer, investment advisor*, or investment banking services;\n\n(8) Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit; or\n\n(9) Any other services that the director determines, by rule, are impermissible.\n\n8. Insurers having direct written and assumed premiums of less than one hundred million dollars in any calendar year may request an exemption from subsection 7 of this section. The insurer shall file with the director a written statement discussing the reasons why the insurer should be exempt from these provisions. If the director finds, upon review of this statement, that compliance with this requirement would constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon the insurer, an exemption may be granted.\n\n9. A qualified independent certified public accountant who performs the audit may engage in other nonaudit services, including tax services, that are not described in and do not conflict with subsection 7 of this section, only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee, in accordance with subsection 10 of this section.\n\n10. All auditing services and nonaudit services provided to an insurer by the qualified independent certified public accountant of the insurer shall be preapproved by the audit committee. The preapproval requirement is waived with respect to nonaudit services if the insurer is a SOX compliant entity or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a SOX compliant entity or:\n\n(1) The aggregate amount of all such nonaudit services provided to the insurer constitutes not more than five percent of the total amount of fees paid by the insurer to its qualified independent certified public accountant during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided;\n\n(2) The services were not recognized by the insurer at the time of the engagement to be nonaudit services; and\n\n(3) The services are promptly brought to the attention of the audit committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the audit committee or by one or more members of the audit committee who are the members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the audit committee.\n\n11. The audit committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the audit committee the authority to grant the preapprovals required by subsection 10 of this section. The decisions of any member to whom this authority is delegated shall be presented to the full audit committee at each of its scheduled meetings.\n\n12. The director shall not recognize an independent certified public accountant as qualified for a particular insurer if a member of the board, president, chief executive officer, controller, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, or any person serving in an equivalent position for that insurer was employed by the independent certified public accountant and participated in the audit of that insurer during the one-year period preceding the date that the most current statutory opinion is due.\n\n13. Subsection 12 of this section shall only apply to partners and senior managers involved in the audit. An insurer may make application to the director for relief from subsection 12 of this section on the basis of unusual circumstances. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval for relief from subsection 12 of this section with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and the NAIC. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al. § 7, A.L. 2009 H.B. 577)\n\n*Word \"adviser\" appears in original rolls.",

The director may petition the court for an order directing him to liquidate a domestic insurer or an alien insurer domiciled in this state on the basis:\n\n(1) Of any ground for an order of rehabilitation as specified in section 375.1165, whether or not there has been a prior order directing the rehabilitation of the insurer;\n\n(2) That the insurer is insolvent;\n\n(3) That the insurer is in such condition that the further transaction of business would be hazardous, financially or otherwise, to its policyholders, its creditors or the public;\n\n(4) That the insurer is found to be in such condition after examination that it could not meet the requirements for incorporation and authorization specified in the law under which it was incorporated or is doing business; or\n\n(5) That the insurer has ceased to transact the business of insurance for a period of one year.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a domestic insurer organized as a stock insurance company may voluntarily dissolve and liquidate as a corporation under*sections 351.462 to 351.482, provided that:\n\n(1) The director, in his or her sole discretion, approves the articles of dissolution prior to filing such articles with the secretary of state. In determining whether to approve or disapprove the articles of dissolution, the director shall consider, among other factors, whether:\n\n(a) The insurer's annual financial statements filed with the director show no written insurance premiums for five years; and\n\n(b) The insurer has demonstrated that all policyholder claims have been satisfied or have been transferred to another insurer in a transaction approved by the director; and\n\n(c) An examination of the insurer pursuant to sections 374.202 to 374.207 has been completed within the last five years; and\n\n(2) The domestic insurer files with the secretary of state a copy of the director's approval, certified by the director, along with articles of dissolution as provided in section 351.462 or 351.468.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al. § 65, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 2010 S.B. 583 with S.B. 834, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1764 referendum, Adopted August 3, 2010)\n\nEffective 8-03-10 (H.B. 1764); 8-28-10 (S.B. 583); 8-28-10 (S.B. 834)\n\n*Words \"pursuant to\" appear in original rolls of S.B. 834.",

Director to be liquidator — powers and duties — special deputy may be appointed, powers — effect of liquidation — order for, issued when — plan for continued operation during appeal, contents — penalty for interference with records or property. —1. An order to liquidate the business of a domestic insurer shall appoint the director and his successors as liquidator and shall direct the liquidator forthwith to take immediate possession of the assets of the insurer and to administer them subject to the supervision of the court until the liquidator is discharged by the court. The liquidation of any insurer shall be considered to be the business of insurance for purposes of application of any law of this state. The liquidator shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts and rights of action, and all of the books and records of the insurer ordered liquidated, wherever located, as of the entry of the order of liquidation. The order shall require the liquidator to take immediate possession of and to secure all of the records and property of the insurer wherever it is located, and to take all measures necessary to preserve the integrity of the insurer's records. The filing or recording of the order with the clerk of the court and the recorder of deeds of the county in which its principal office or place of business is located or, in the case of real estate, with the recorder of deeds of the county where the property is located, shall impart the same notice as a deed, bill of sale or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that recorder of deeds would have imparted.\n\n2. With the approval of the court, the director as liquidator may appoint a special deputy or deputies to act for him under sections 375.1175 to 375.1230. The special deputy shall not be an employee of the department of commerce and insurance. The special deputy shall have all powers of the liquidator granted by sections 375.1175 to 375.1230. The special deputy shall administer and liquidate the insolvent insurer subject to the general supervision of the director and the specific supervision of the court as provided in sections 375.1175 to 375.1230.\n\n3. Upon issuance of the order of liquidation, the rights and liabilities of any such insurer and of its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members and any other persons interested in its estate shall become fixed and the termination of any period fixed by any statute of limitations provided by law shall be suspended as of the date of entry of the order of liquidation, except as provided in sections 375.1178, 375.1206 and 375.1210. Rights of shareholders provided by any law other than as provided by sections 375.1150 to 375.1246 shall be suspended upon issuance of the order of liquidation.\n\n4. An order to liquidate the business of an alien insurer domiciled in this state shall be in the same terms and have the same legal effect as an order to liquidate a domestic insurer, except that the assets and the business in the United States shall be the only assets and business included therein.\n\n5. At the time of petitioning for an order of liquidation, or at any time thereafter, the director, after making determination of an insurer's insolvency, may petition the court for a judicial declaration of such insolvency. After providing such notice and hearing as it deems proper, the court may make the declaration.\n\n6. (1) Any order issued under this section shall require periodic financial reports to the court by the liquidator. Financial reports shall include, at a minimum, the assets and liabilities of the insurer and all funds received or disbursed by the liquidator during the current period. Financial reports shall be filed within one year of the liquidation order and at least annually thereafter.\n\n(2) After an order of liquidation has been entered, the liquidator of such insurer shall file with the director a statement which shall reflect the claims reserves, including losses incurred but not reported, and unearned premium reserves which have been established by the liquidator and which shall also set forth the amounts of such reserves that are allocable to particular reinsurers of the insolvent company. A similar statement shall be filed by each liquidator not less frequently than annually and shall be considered for all intents and purposes as the annual statement which was required to be filed by the insurer with the director prior to the liquidation proceedings. To the extent that any reinsurer of an insurer in liquidation would have been required under any agreement pertaining to reinsurance to post letters of credit or other security prior to an order of liquidation to cover such reserves reflected upon a statement filed with a regulatory authority, such reinsurer shall be required to post letters of credit or other security to cover such reserves after an insurer has been placed in liquidation. If a reinsurer shall fail to post letters of credit or other security required by a reinsurance agreement or the provisions of this section, the director may issue an order barring such reinsurer from thereafter reinsuring any insurer which is incorporated under the laws of the state of Missouri.\n\n7. (1) Within five days after the initiation of an appeal of an order of liquidation, the liquidator shall present for the court's approval a plan for the continued performance of the defendant company's policy claims obligations, including the duty to defend insureds under liability insurance policies, during the pendency of an appeal. Such plan shall provide for the continued performance and payment of policy claims obligations in the normal course of events, notwithstanding the grounds alleged in support of the order of liquidation including the ground of insolvency. In the event the defendant company's financial condition, in the judgment of the liquidator, will not support the full performance of all policy claims obligations during the appeal pendency period, the plan may prefer the claims of certain policyholders and claimants over creditors and interested parties as well as other policyholders and claimants, as the liquidator finds to be fair and equitable considering the relative circumstances of such policyholders and claimants. The court shall examine the plan submitted by the liquidator and if it finds the plan to be in the best interests of the parties, the court shall approve the plan. No action shall lie against the liquidator or any of his deputies, agents, clerks, assistants or attorneys by any party based on preference in an appeal pendency plan approved by the court.\n\n(2) The appeal pendency plan shall not supersede or affect the obligations of any insurance guaranty association.\n\n(3) Any such plans shall provide for equitable adjustments to be made by the liquidator to any distributions of assets to guaranty associations, in the event that the liquidator pays claims from assets of the estate, which would otherwise be the obligations of any particular guaranty association but for the appeal of the order of liquidation, such that all guaranty associations equally benefit on a pro rata basis from the assets of the estate. Further, in the event an order of liquidation is set aside upon any appeal, the company shall not be released from delinquency proceedings unless and until all funds advanced by any guaranty association, including reasonable allocated loss adjustment expenses in connection therewith relating to obligations of the company, shall be repaid in full, together with interest at the judgment rate of interest or unless an arrangement for repayment thereof has been made with the consent of all applicable guaranty associations.\n\n8. Any person who shall knowingly destroy, conceal, convert or alter any records or property of an insurer after entry of an order of liquidation, without having received prior written permission of the liquidator or of the court, or who shall knowingly neglect or refuse, upon the order or demand of the liquidator, to deliver to the liquidator any records or property of an insurer in his possession or control, shall be guilty of a class D felony.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al. § 66, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nEffective 1-01-17",

The liquidator shall have the power:\n\n(1) To employ employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers, consultants and such other personnel as he may deem necessary to assist in the liquidation;\n\n(2) To fix the reasonable compensation of employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers and consultants with the approval of the court;\n\n(3) To pay reasonable compensation to persons appointed and to defray from the funds or assets of the insurer all expenses of taking possession of, conserving, conducting, liquidating, disposing of, or otherwise dealing with the business and property of the insurer. In the event that the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the director may advance the costs so incurred out of funds appropriated for that purpose. Any amounts so advanced for expenses of administration shall be repaid to the director out of the first available moneys of the insurer and such funds repaid shall be transferred by the director to the state treasurer for deposit to the general revenue fund;\n\n(4) To hold hearings, to subpoena witnesses to compel their attendance, to administer oaths, to examine any persons under oath, and to compel any person to subscribe to his testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing; and in connection therewith to require the production of any books, papers, records or other documents which he deems relevant to the inquiry;\n\n(5) To audit the books and records of all agents of the insurer insofar as those records relate to the business activities of the insurer;\n\n(6) To collect all debts and moneys due and claims belonging to the insurer, wherever located, and for this purpose:\n\n(a) To institute timely action in other jurisdictions, in order to forestall garnishment and attachment proceedings against such debts;\n\n(b) To do such other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve or protect its assets or property, including the power to sell, compound, compromise or assign debts for purposes of collection upon such terms and conditions as he deems best; and\n\n(c) To pursue any creditor's remedies available to enforce his claims;\n\n(7) To conduct public and private sales of the property of the insurer;\n\n(8) To use assets of the estate of an insurer under a liquidation order to transfer policy obligations to a solvent assuming insurer, if the transfer can be arranged without prejudice to applicable priorities under section 375.1218;\n\n(9) To acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell, transfer, abandon or otherwise dispose of or deal with, any property of the insurer at its market value or upon such terms and conditions as are fair and reasonable. He shall also have power to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all deeds;\n\n(10) To borrow money on the security of the insurer's assets or without security and to execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation. Any such funds borrowed may be repaid as an administrative expense and have priority over any other claims in class 1 under the priority of distribution;\n\n(11) To enter into such contracts as are necessary to carry out the order to liquidate, and to affirm or disavow any contracts to which the insurer is a party;\n\n(12) To continue to prosecute and to institute in the name of the insurer or in his own name any and all suits and other legal proceedings, in this state or elsewhere, and, with the approval of the supervising court, to abandon the prosecution of claims he deems unprofitable to pursue further. If the insurer is dissolved under section 375.1180, he shall have the power to apply to any court in this state or elsewhere for leave to substitute himself for the insurer as plaintiff;\n\n(13) To prosecute any action which may exist on behalf of the creditors, members, policyholders or shareholders of the insurer against any officer of the insurer, or any other person;\n\n(14) To institute proceedings in the same case for receivership for any organization or corporation having the exclusive or dominant right to manage or control the insurer which is the subject of the main case, when it appears that a receiver is necessary for the preservation of the assets of the insurer or that a receiver is necessary to determine the assets of the insurer held by the organization or corporation. The duration of the receivership and the duties of the receiver shall be in the discretion of the court;\n\n(15) To remove any or all records and property of the insurer to the offices of the director or to such other place as may be convenient for the purposes of efficient and orderly execution of the liquidation. Guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations shall have such reasonable access to the records of the insurer as is necessary for them to carry out their legal obligations;\n\n(16) To deposit in one or more banks in this state such sums as are required for meeting current administration expenses and dividend distributions and to invest all sums not currently needed, unless the court orders otherwise; provided that, at the election of the supervising court, funds held by the liquidator of the insurer's estate shall be deposited and invested by the liquidator pursuant to either of the following standards as the court shall order:\n\n(a) The standards specified by law for the deposit and investment of state funds by the state treasurer, as such standards are determined to be applicable by the court;\n\n(b) The standards specified by law for the investment of money and property of the Missouri state employees' retirement system, as such standards are determined to be applicable by the court;\n\n(17) To file any necessary documents for record in the office of any recorder of deeds or other office in this state or elsewhere where property of the insurer is located;\n\n(18) To assert all defenses available to the insurer as against third persons, including statutes of limitation, statutes of frauds, and the defense of usury. A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a petition in liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator. Whenever a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association has an obligation to defend any suit, the liquidator shall give precedence to such obligation and may defend only in the absence of a defense by such guaranty associations;\n\n(19) To exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies, and powers of any creditor, shareholder, policyholder or member, including any power to avoid any transfer or lien that may be given by the general law and that is not included within*sections 375.1192 to 375.1195, except for any right of distribution pursuant to section 375.1218;\n\n(20) To intervene in any proceeding wherever instituted that might lead to the appointment of a receiver or trustee, and to act as the receiver or trustee whenever the appointment is offered;\n\n(21) To enter into agreements with any receiver or director of any other state relating to the rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution of an insurer doing business in both states; and\n\n(22) To exercise all powers now held or hereafter conferred upon receivers by the laws of this state not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 375.1150 to 375.1246.\n\n2. (1) If an insurer being liquidated issued liability policies on a claims-made basis, which provided an option to purchase an extended period to report claims, then the liquidator may make available to holders of such policies, for a charge, an extended period to report claims as stated herein. The extended reporting period shall be made available only to those insureds who have not secured substitute coverage. The extended period made available by the liquidator shall begin upon termination of any extended period to report claims in the basic policy and shall end at the earlier of the final date for filing of claims in the liquidation proceeding or eighteen months from the entry of the order of liquidation.\n\n(2) The extended period to report claims made available by the liquidator shall be subject to the terms of the policy to which it relates. The liquidator shall make available such extended period within sixty days after the order of liquidation at a charge to be determined by the liquidator subject to approval of the court. Such offer shall be deemed rejected unless the offer is accepted in writing and the charge is paid within ninety days after the order of liquidation. No commissions, premium taxes, assessments or other fees shall be due on the charges paid by policyholders pertaining to the extended period to report claims.\n\n3. The enumeration in this section of the powers and authority of the liquidator shall not be construed as a limitation upon him, nor shall it exclude in any manner his right to do such other acts not herein specifically enumerated, or otherwise provided for, as may be necessary or appropriate for the accomplishment of or in aid of the purpose of liquidation.\n\n4.

Contracts reinsuring policies of life or health insurance or annuities referred to in section 375.1178 issued by a ceding insurer that has been placed into liquidation under sections 375.1150 to 375.1246 shall be continued, subject to the provisions of this section, unless:\n\n(1) The contracts were terminated pursuant to their terms prior to the date of the order of liquidation; or\n\n(2) The contracts were terminated pursuant to the order of liquidation, in which case the provisions of subsection 9 of this section shall apply.\n\n3. (1) At any time within one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, a guaranty association covering policies of life or health insurance or annuities referred to in section 375.1178, in whole or in part, may elect to assume the rights and obligations of the ceding insurer that relate to the policies or annuities under any one or more reinsurance contracts between the ceding insurer and its reinsurers. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be made by the guaranty association or the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations on its behalf by sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers.\n\n(2) To facilitate the decision, the receiver and each affected reinsurer shall make available upon request to the guaranty association or to the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations on its behalf:\n\n(a) Copies of in-force reinsurance contracts and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed; and\n\n(b) Notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts.\n\n(3) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subdivision shall apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by a guaranty association:\n\n(a) The guaranty association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts, for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation;\n\n(b) The guaranty association shall be entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods on or after the date of the order of liquidation;\n\n(c) Within thirty days following the date of the guaranty association's election to assume a reinsurance contract, the guaranty association and the reinsurer shall calculate the balance due to or from the guaranty association under each reinsurance contract as of the date of such election, and the guaranty association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other within thirty-five days of the date of such election. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the guaranty association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contract or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (3) of subsection 9 of this section;\n\n(d) If the guaranty association, or receiver on behalf of such guaranty association, within sixty days of the date of the guaranty association's election to assume a reinsurance contract, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the date of such election that are due pursuant to the reinsurance contract, the reinsurer shall not be entitled to terminate the reinsurance contract for failure to pay premiums, and shall not be entitled to set off any unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the guaranty association, against amounts due such guaranty association.\n\n4. If a receiver continues policies of life or health insurance or annuities referred to in section 375.1178 in force following an order of liquidation, and the policies or annuities are not covered in whole or in part by one or more guaranty associations, the receiver may, within one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, elect to assume the rights and obligations of the ceding insurer under any one or more of the reinsurance contracts that relate to the policies or annuities, provided the contracts have not been terminated as set forth in subsection 2 of this section. The election shall be made by sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers. In that event, payment of premiums on the reinsurance contracts for the policies and annuities, for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, shall be chargeable against the estate as a class 1 administrative expense. Amounts paid by the reinsurer on account of losses on the policies and annuities shall be to the estate of the ceding insurer.\n\n5. During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the date the guaranty association or the receiver elects to assume the rights and obligations of the ceding insurer under any one or more of the reinsurance contracts that relate to the policies or annuities as provided for in subsection 3 or 4 of this section, the guaranty association, the receiver, and the reinsurer shall not have any rights or obligations under any reinsurance contract that is eligible for assumption by such association or the receiver.\n\n6. (1) If the guaranty association or the receiver, as the case may be, has timely elected to assume a reinsurance contract pursuant to subsection 3 or 4 of this section, as applicable, the parties' rights and obligations shall be governed by the provisions of subsection 3 or 4 of this section, as applicable.\n\n(2) Where the guaranty association covering policies of life or health insurance or annuities referred to in section 375.1178 or the receiver, as the case may be, does not timely elect to assume a reinsurance contract pursuant to subsection 3 or 4 of this section, as applicable, the reinsurance contract shall be terminated retroactively effective on the date of the order of liquidation and subsection 9 of this section shall apply.\n\n7. When policies of life or health insurance or annuities referred to in section 375.1178, or the obligations of the guaranty association with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies or annuities may also be transferred by the guaranty association, in the case of contracts assumed under subsection 3 of this section, or the receiver, in the case of contracts assumed under subsection 4 of this section, subject to the following:\n\n(1) Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred shall not cover any new policies or annuities in addition to those transferred;\n\n(2) The obligations described in subsections 3 and 4 of this section shall no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and\n\n(3) Notice shall be given in writing, return receipt requested, by the transferring party to the affected reinsurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer.\n\n8. The provisions of this section shall, to the extent provided in sections 375.1150 to 375.1246, supersede the provisions of any law or of any affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the ceding insurer or any other person. The receiver shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to provisions of sections 375.1150 to 375.1246 including applicable setoff provisions.\n\n9. When a reinsurance contract is terminated pursuant to sections 375.1150 to 375.1246, the reinsurer and the receiver shall commence a mandatory negotiation procedure in accordance with this subsection:\n\n(1) No later than thirty days after the date of termination, each party shall appoint an actuary to determine an estimated sum due as a result of the termination of the reinsurance contract calculated in a way expected to make the parties economically indifferent as to whether the reinsurance contract continues or terminates, giving due regard to the economic effects of the insolvency.

The parties shall make a good faith effort to reach agreement on the sum due;\n\n(3) If the parties are unable to reach agreement within ninety days following the submission of materials required in subdivision (2) of this subsection, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the reinsurance contract. In the event that the reinsurance contract does not contain an arbitration clause, either party may initiate arbitration pursuant to this subdivision by providing the other party with a written demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the following procedures:\n\n(a) Venue for the arbitration shall be within the county of the court's jurisdiction pursuant to section 375.1154, or another location agreed to by the parties;\n\n(b) Within thirty days of the responding party's receipt of the arbitration demand, each party shall appoint an arbitrator who is a disinterested active or retired officer or executive of a life or health insurance or reinsurance company, or other professional with no less than ten years' experience in or relating to the field of life or health insurance or reinsurance. The two arbitrators shall appoint an independent, impartial, disinterested umpire who is an active or retired officer or executive of a life or health insurance or reinsurance company, or other professional with no less than ten years' experience in the field of life or health insurance or reinsurance. If the arbitrators are unable to agree on an umpire, each arbitrator shall provide the other with the names of three qualified individuals, each arbitrator shall strike two names from the other's list, and the umpire shall be chosen by drawing lots from the remaining individuals;\n\n(c) Within sixty days following the appointment of the umpire, the parties shall, unless otherwise ordered by the panel, submit to the arbitration panel their estimates of the sum due as a result of the termination of the reinsurance contract, together with all relevant documents and other information supporting the estimate;\n\n(d) The time periods set forth in these paragraphs may be extended upon mutual agreement of the parties;\n\n(e) The panel shall have all powers necessary to conduct the arbitration proceedings in a fair and appropriate manner, including the power to request additional information from the parties, authorize discovery, hold hearings, and hear testimony. The panel also may appoint independent actuarial experts, the expense of which shall be shared equally between the parties;\n\n(4) An arbitration panel considering the matters set forth in this subsection shall apply the standards set forth in this subsection and shall issue a written award specifying a net settlement amount due from one party or the other as a result of the termination of the reinsurance contract. The receivership court shall confirm that award absent proof of statutory grounds for vacating or modifying arbitration awards under the Federal Arbitration Act;\n\n(5) If the net settlement amount agreed or awarded pursuant to this subsection is payable by the reinsurer, the reinsurer shall pay the amount due to the estate subject to any applicable set-off under section 375.1198. If the net settlement amount agreed or awarded pursuant to this subsection is payable by the ceding insurer, the reinsurer shall be deemed to have a timely filed claim against the estate for that amount, which claim shall be paid pursuant to the priority established in subdivision (5)*of section 375.1218. The affected guaranty associations shall not be entitled to receive the net settlement amount, except to the extent they are entitled to share in the estate assets as creditors of the estate, and shall have no responsibility for the net settlement amount.\n\n10. Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section shall alter or modify the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall abrogate or limit any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall give a policyholder or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section shall limit or affect any guaranty association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. Nothing in this section shall apply to reinsurance contracts covering property or casualty risks.\n\n11.

If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then such transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within two years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.\n\n(2) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:\n\n(a) The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer; or\n\n(b) The transfer was made within four months before the filing of the petition; or\n\n(c) The creditor receiving it or to be benefitted thereby or his agent acting with reference thereto had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or\n\n(d) The creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer, as an officer whether or not he held such position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five percent of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm, corporation, association, or persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm's length.\n\n(3) Where the preference is avoidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property; except where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair market value, he shall have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.\n\n2. (1) A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes perfected to the extent that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes perfected to the extent that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.\n\n(3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.\n\n(4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.\n\n3. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of such proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.\n\n(2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of subsection 2 of this section, if such consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. Such a lien could not, however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of subsection 2 of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action or ruling.\n\n4. A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection 2 of this section to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' rights are performed within twenty-one days or any period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.\n\n5. If any lien deemed voidable under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which thereby has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under this act*which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.\n\n6. The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections 1 and 5 of this section shall be discharged from such lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.\n\n7. The court shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section. Reasonable notice of any hearings in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnified or than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within such reasonable times and upon such terms as the court shall fix.\n\n8. The liability of the surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the liquidator, or where the property is retained under subsection 7 of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.\n\n9. If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within four months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this act*, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent that the amount of such money or value of such property is reasonable as relates to actual services rendered as determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate, provided that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate thereof, payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provision of paragraph (d) of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section.\n\n10. (1) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney or any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference when he has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference. A rebuttable presumption may be established that such a person is personally liable if the transfer was made within four months before the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation.\n\n(2) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection 1 of this section shall be personally liable therefor and shall be bound to account to the liquidator.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any person.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al. § 77)\n\n*\"This act\" (H.B. 385, et al., 1991) contained numerous sections.

Whenever any third party asserts a cause of action against an insured of an insurer in liquidation, the third party may file a claim with the liquidator.\n\n2. Whether or not the third party files a claim, the insured may file a claim on his own behalf in the liquidation. If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within sixty days after mailing of the notice required by section 375.1185, whichever is later, he is an unexcused late filer.\n\n3. The liquidator shall make his recommendations to the court under section 375.1218, for the allowance of an insured's claim under subsection 2 of this section after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action and the probable costs and expenses of defense. After allowance by the court, the liquidator shall withhold any dividends payable on the claims, pending the outcome of liquidation and negotiation with the insured. Whenever it seems appropriate, he shall reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and amend his recommendations to the court. The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendation as in its initial determination. The court may amend its allowance as it thinks appropriate. As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage dividend as was paid on other claims of like property, based on the lesser of the amount actually recovered from the insured by action or paid by agreement plus the reasonable costs and expense of defense, or the amount allowed on the claims by the court. After all claims are settled or barred, any sum remaining from the amount withheld shall revert to the undistributed assets of the insurer. Delay in final payment under this subsection shall not be a reason for unreasonable delay of final distribution and discharge of the liquidator.\n\n4. The liability of the insurer relating to liabilities incurred, but for which claims relating to such liabilities are not reported, accrued or claimed, shall be determined with reference to the provisions of this subsection. In such an event, the amount of such liabilities shall be calculated, at their present value, by a panel appointed pursuant to this subsection. The liquidator and the claimant shall each appoint one arbitrator, and the court shall appoint a special magistrate who shall preside over all proceedings under this subsection. Thereupon, the panel shall hear and determine the amount of such liabilities pursuant to the procedures provided by sections 435.365 to 435.395. Any party to the proceeding shall have all rights provided by sections 435.400 to 435.455 and the provisions of said sections shall be applicable to such proceedings.\n\n5. If several claims founded upon one policy are filed, whether by third parties or claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total equals the policy limit. Claims by the insured shall be evaluated as provided in subsection 3 of this section. If any insured's claim is subsequently reduced under subsection 3 of this section, the amount thus freed shall be apportioned ratably among the claims which have been reduced under this subsection.\n\n6. No claim may be presented under this section if it is or may be covered by any guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al. § 87)",

No subclasses shall be established within any class.

The order of distribution of claims shall be:\n\n(1) Class 1. The costs and expenses of administration during rehabilitation and liquidation, including but not limited to the following:\n\n(a) The actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer, and costs necessary to store records required to be preserved pursuant to section 375.1228;\n\n(b) Compensation for all authorized services rendered in the rehabilitation and liquidation;\n\n(c) Any necessary filing fees;\n\n(d) The fees and mileage payable to witnesses;\n\n(e) Authorized reasonable attorney's fees and other professional services rendered in the rehabilitation and liquidation; and\n\n(f) The reasonable expenses of the Missouri Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association, the Missouri Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association, and any similar organization in any other state, including overhead, salaries, and other general administrative expenses allocable to the receivership. These expenses shall be subordinate to all other costs and expenses of administration under paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subdivision. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the distribution of claims from an insurer's estate if such insurer was first placed under an order of rehabilitation or an order of liquidation if no order of rehabilitation was entered on or after August 28, 2018.\n\n(2) Class 2. All claims under policies including such claims of the federal or any state or local government for losses incurred (\"loss claims\") including third party claims and all claims of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association including reasonable allocated loss adjustment expenses and all claims of a life and health insurance guaranty association or foreign guaranty association which covers claims of life and health insurance policies, relating to the handling of such claims. All claims under life insurance and annuity policies and funding agreements, whether for death proceeds, annuity proceeds or investment values shall be treated as loss claims. That portion of any loss, indemnification for which is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered by the claimant, shall not be included in this class, other than benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligation of support or by way of succession at death or as proceeds of life insurance, or as gratuities. No payment by an employer to his employee shall be treated as a gratuity. Early distributions to guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations may be made in the manner provided in section 375.1205, provided that such guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations agree to indemnify the liquidator if a shortage occurs in the insurer's estate of property necessary to settle claims as provided by this section. Any early distributions shall not increase the proportionate share of such guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations, of distributions of the insurer's estate. The liquidator shall have authority to inquire into the reasonableness of any allocated loss adjustment expenses claimed by a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association and such claim shall not be allowed if it is found to be unreasonable.\n\n(3) Class 3. Claims of the United States government other than those claims included in class 2.\n\n(4) Class 4. Reasonable compensation to employees for services performed to the extent that they do not exceed two months of monetary compensation and represent payment for services performed within one year before the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if rehabilitation preceded liquidation, within one year before the filing of the petition for rehabilitation. Principal officers and directors shall not be entitled to the benefit of this priority except as otherwise approved by the liquidator and the court. Such priority shall be in lieu of any other similar priority which may be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees.\n\n(5) Class 5.

Claims of any state or local government except those under class 2 of this section. Claims, including those of any governmental body for a penalty or forfeiture, shall be allowed in this class only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby. The remainder of such claims shall be postponed as class 9 claims.\n\n(7) Class 7. Claims filed late or any other claims other than class 8 or 9 claims.\n\n(8) Class 8.

Insolvent insurers, claims to be handled by guaranty association — definitions — payment of claims, reimbursement — receiver obligations and utilization of collateral. —1. The provisions of this section shall apply to workers' compensation large deductible policies issued by an insurer subject to delinquency proceedings under this chapter. This section shall not apply to first party claims or to claims funded by a guaranty association net of the deductible unless subsection 3 of this section applies. Large deductible policies shall be administered in accordance with their terms, except to the extent such terms conflict with the provisions of this section.\n\n2. For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Collateral\", any cash, letters of credit, surety bond, or any other form of security posted by the insured or by a captive insurer or reinsurer to secure the insured's obligation under the large deductible policy to pay deductible claims or to reimburse the insurer for deductible claim payments. Collateral may also secure an insured's obligation to reimburse or pay the insurer as may be required for other secured obligations;\n\n(2)\"Commercially reasonable\", to act in good faith using prevailing industry practices and making all reasonable efforts considering the facts and circumstances of the matter;\n\n(3)\"Deductible claim\", any claim, including a claim for loss and defense and cost-containment expense, unless such expenses are excluded, under a large deductible policy that is within the deductible;\n\n(4)\"Delinquency proceeding\", shall have the same meaning ascribed to it in section 375.1152;\n\n(5)\"Guaranty association\", the Missouri property and casualty insurance guaranty association created by sections 375.771 to 375.779, as amended, and any other similar entities created by the laws of any other state for the payment of claims of insolvent insurers;\n\n(6)\"Large deductible policy\", any combination of one or more workers' compensation policies and endorsements issued to an insured and contracts or security agreements entered into between an insured and the insurer in which the insured has agreed with the insurer to:\n\n(a) Pay directly the initial portion of any claim under the policy up to a specified dollar amount or the expenses related to any claim; or\n\n(b) Reimburse the insurer for its payment of any claim or related expenses under the policy up to the specified dollar amount of the deductible.\n\n­­The term large deductible policy also includes policies that contain an aggregate limit on the insured's liability for all deductible claims in addition to a per-claim deductible limit. The primary purpose and distinguishing characteristic of a large deductible policy is the shifting of a portion of the ultimate financial responsibility under the large deductible policy to pay claims from the insurer to the insured, even though the obligation to initially pay claims may remain with the insurer. Large deductible policies do not include policies, endorsements, or agreements which provide that the initial portion of any covered claim shall be self-insured and further that the insurer**shall have no payment obligation within the self-insured retention. Large deductible policies also do not include policies that provide for retrospectively rated premium payments by the insured or reinsurance arrangements or agreements, except to the extent such arrangements or agreements assume, secure, or pay the policyholder's large deductible obligations;\n\n(7)\"Other secured obligations\", obligations of an insured to an insurer other than those under a large deductible policy, such as those under a reinsurance agreement or other agreement involving retrospective premium obligations, the performance of which is secured by collateral that also secures an insured's obligations under a large deductible policy;\n\n(8)\"Receiver\", shall have the same meaning ascribed to it in section 375.1152.\n\n3. Unless otherwise agreed by the responsible guaranty association, all large deductible claims which are also covered claims, as defined by the applicable guaranty association law, including those that may have been funded by an insured before liquidation, shall be turned over to the guaranty association for handling. To the extent the insured funds or pays the deductible claim pursuant to an agreement by the guaranty fund or otherwise, the insured's funding or payment of a deductible claim will extinguish the obligations, if any, of the receiver or any guaranty association to pay such claim. No charge of any kind shall be made against the receiver or a guaranty association on the basis of an insured's funding or payment of a deductible claim.\n\n4. To the extent a guaranty association pays any deductible claim for which the insurer would have been entitled to reimbursement from the insured, a guaranty association shall be entitled to the full amount of the reimbursement and available collateral as provided for under this section to the extent necessary to reimburse the guaranty association. Such reimbursements and collateral shall be subject to any reasonable and actual expenses recovered by the receiver as provided for under subsection 7 of this section. Reimbursements paid to the guaranty association under this subsection shall not be treated as distributions under section 375.1218 or as early access payments under section 375.1205. To the extent that a guaranty association pays a deductible claim that is not reimbursed either from collateral or by insured payments, or incurred expenses in connection with large deductible policies that are not reimbursed under this section, the guaranty association shall be entitled to assert a claim for those amounts in the delinquency proceeding. Nothing in this subsection limits any rights of the receiver or a guaranty association that may otherwise exist under applicable law to obtain reimbursement from insureds for claims payments made by the guaranty association under policies of the insurer or for the guaranty association's related expenses such as those affording the guaranty association the right to recover for claims payments made to or on behalf of high net worth insureds or claimants.\n\n5. (1) The receiver shall have the obligation to collect reimbursements owed for deductible claims as provided for herein and shall take all commercially reasonable actions to collect such reimbursements. The receiver shall promptly bill insureds for reimbursement of deductible claims:\n\n(a) Paid by the insurer prior to the commencement of delinquency proceedings;\n\n(b) Paid by a guaranty association upon receipt by the receiver of notice from a guaranty association of reimbursable payments; or\n\n(c) Paid or allowed by the receiver.\n\n(2) If the insured does not make payment within the time specified in the large deductible policy, or within sixty days after the date of billing if no time is specified, the receiver shall take all commercially reasonable actions to collect any reimbursements owed.\n\n(3) Neither the insolvency of the insurer, nor its inability to perform any of its obligations under the large deductible policy, shall be a defense to the insured's reimbursement obligation under the large deductible policy.\n\n(4) Except for gross negligence, an allegation of improper handling or payment of a deductible claim by the insurer, the receiver, or any guaranty association shall not be a defense to the insured's reimbursement obligations under the large deductible policy.\n\n6. (1) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the receiver shall utilize collateral if available to secure the insured's obligation to fund or reimburse deductible claims or other secured obligations or other payment obligations. A guaranty association shall be entitled to collateral as provided for in this subsection to the extent needed to reimburse a guaranty association for the payments of a deductible claim. Any distributions made to a guaranty association under this subsection shall not be treated as distributions under section 375.1218 or as early access payments under section 375.1205.\n\n(2) All claims against the collateral shall be paid in the order received and no claim of the receiver, including those described in this subsection, shall supersede any other claim against the collateral as described in subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(3) The receiver shall draw down collateral to the extent necessary in the event that the insured fails to:\n\n(a) Perform its funding or payment obligations under any large deductible policy;\n\n(b) Pay deductible claim reimbursements within the time specified in the large deductible policy or within sixty days after the date of the billing if no time is specified;\n\n(c) Pay amounts due the estate for preliquidation obligations;\n\n(d) Timely fund any other secured obligation; or\n\n(e) Timely pay expenses.\n\n(4) Claims that are validly asserted against the collateral shall be satisfied in the order in which such claims are received by the receiver; except that, if more than one creditor has a valid claim against the same collateral and the available collateral, along with billing collection efforts and to the extent that the collateral is subject to other known secured obligations, are together insufficient to pay each creditor in full, then the director as rehabilitator or liquidator shall prorate payments to each creditor based upon the relationship the amount of claims each creditor has paid bears to the total of all claims paid by all such creditors.\n\n(5) Excess collateral may be returned to the insured as determined by the receiver after a periodic review of claims paid, outstanding case reserves, and a factor for incurred but not reported claims.\n\n7. The receiver shall be entitled to deduct from the collateral or from the deductible reimbursements reasonable and actual expenses incurred in connection with the collection of the collateral and deductible reimbursements under the provisions of this section, subject to the review and approval by the court.\n\n8. The court having jurisdiction over the delinquency proceedings under section 375.1154 shall have jurisdiction to resolve disputes arising under the provisions of this section.\n\n9. The provisions of this section shall apply to all delinquency proceedings that either commence on or after September 14, 2016, or are open and pending on September 14, 2016, provided that, the provisions of this section shall not affect any delinquency proceeding for which a final order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to September 14, 2016.\n\n10. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or adversely affect any rights or powers a guaranty association may have under applicable state law to obtain reimbursement from certain classes of policyholders for claims payments made by the guaranty association under policies of the insolvent insurer, or for related expenses the guaranty association incurs.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1763)\n\n*Effective 9-14-16.
