Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a bank or trust company may transfer by assignment to an affiliated entity any or all of the fiduciary capacities of such bank or trust company, without any order of or other action by any court or any consent or other approval of any interested person, except as provided in subsection 5 of this section, upon the prior approval of the director of finance and provided that such bank or trust company complies with the provisions of this section. The assignment may designate all fiduciary capacities, a general class or classes of fiduciary capacities, or specified individual accounts or other particularly identified fiduciary capacities.\n\n3. The bank or trust company, together with the affiliated entity, shall file an application for approval of the transfer of fiduciary capacities with the director of finance together with such other information as the director of finance may deem necessary. Before the director of finance issues an order approving the transfer of fiduciary capacities, the bank or trust company shall also file proof in a form satisfactory to the director of finance that the bank or trust company has given written notice, including a summary of the provisions of subsection 5 of this section relating to objections to the transfer of the fiduciary accounts, of the proposed transfer by certified mail, at least thirty days prior to the filing of such proof, to all persons, firms, organizations or corporations who are known to it to be living or existing grantors under each affected trust or other fiduciary account or, if there is no such known living or existing grantor, to each living or existing beneficiary thereof known to it to have received any distribution transmitted by the bank or trust company with respect to such fiduciary account in the calendar year of the giving of such notice or the immediately preceding calendar year. If any living or existing grantor or any such beneficiary delivers to the bank or trust company any communication regarding the proposed transfer, the bank or trust company shall furnish the director of finance with a copy of such communication together with any accompanying documents. If the director of finance shall determine that the affiliated entity has the authority to act in such fiduciary capacities and is qualified to do so and that the transfer of such fiduciary capacities to the affected entity will not materially adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary accounts, he shall issue an order approving such transfer of fiduciary capacities.\n\n4. After the director of finance issues an order approving the transfer of fiduciary capacities, the bank or trust company shall publish a notice of the transfer of fiduciary capacities pursuant to this section in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city in which its main banking house or principal place of business, respectively, is located. Upon the sixtieth day after the date of such publication, the transfer by assignment of fiduciary capacities shall be effective except with respect to any such fiduciary capacities which are then the subject of notice of objection pursuant to subsection 5 of this section.\n\n5. Within sixty days after the publication of notice of the approval by the director of finance of the transfer of fiduciary capacities pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, any person who was entitled to receive a written notice pursuant to subsection 3 of this section may give written notice to the bank or trust company objecting to the transfer of the fiduciary account in which such person has an interest, and the bank or trust company shall petition the circuit court of the county or city in which the notice was published to determine whether the transfer of the fiduciary capacity to the affiliated entity will materially adversely affect the administration of such fiduciary account. After notice to all interested parties and a hearing on the issues, the circuit court may appoint a new fiduciary to succeed the bank or trust company if it finds that the transfer of the fiduciary capacity to the affiliated entity will materially adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary account and that the appointment of a new fiduciary is in the best interests of the beneficiaries of such fiduciary account and, if the court does not so find, it shall direct the bank or trust company to transfer by assignment such fiduciary capacity to the affiliated entity.\n\n6. Each appointment or other designation to a fiduciary capacity of a bank or trust company in a trust, will or other instrument executed after the effective date of any transfer by such bank or trust company pursuant to this section of all fiduciary capacities or a general class of fiduciary capacities in which such appointment or other designation is included shall be deemed an appointment or other designation of the affiliated entity substituted for such bank or trust company, except where the trust, will or other instrument by which such appointment or other designation is made expressly negates the provisions of this section.\n\n7. On the effective date of the transfer of fiduciary capacities pursuant to this section, the transferring bank or trust company shall be released from all transferred fiduciary duties and shall cease to act in all such transferred fiduciary capacities, except that such transferring bank or trust company shall not be relieved of any liabilities arising out of a breach of fiduciary duty occurring prior to such effective date. The transferring bank or trust company shall file an itemized accounting of any assets and liabilities in each transferred fiduciary account with the successor fiduciary upon the effective date of the transfer.

As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Bank\", any bank subject to the provisions of chapter 362, which is duly authorized to exercise trust powers, and any national bank which is authorized to exercise trust powers under the laws of the United States and which has its principal place of business in Missouri, including a national bank whose operations include providing trust and other fiduciary services and related activities;\n\n(2)\"Beneficiary\", any person or entity which benefits from, or has a present or future interest in, any money or property administered by a person with a fiduciary obligation;\n\n(3)\"Director\", the director of the division of finance;\n\n(4)\"Fiduciary obligation\", any obligation of any bank or trust company to a person or entity resulting from an appointment, designation or undertaking to act alone or jointly with others primarily for the benefit of others in matters connected with such appointment, designation or undertaking, and including, but is not limited to, acting as a trustee of a trust, including a testamentary or nontestamentary trust, or a trustee of a common trust fund; executor; administrator; personal representative; guardian; conservator; custodian; assignee; depositary; receiver; attorney-in-fact; registrar or transfer agent with respect to stocks, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of any corporation, association, state, municipality, or public authority; agent, including escrow agent or agent for the investment of money; or in any other similar capacity. The term\"fiduciary obligation\"includes any obligation occurring as a result of an appointment or designation to any foregoing capacity upon the death of a person serving in such capacity or upon the happening of any other future event;\n\n(5)\"Transferee\", a bank or trust company assuming fiduciary obligations pursuant to this section from a transferor;\n\n(6)\"Transferor\", a bank or trust company transferring fiduciary obligations pursuant to this section to a transferee;\n\n(7)\"Trust company\", any trust company or bank organized under the laws of this state which is duly authorized to exercise trust powers.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a bank or trust company may transfer by assignment to another bank or trust company any or all of the fiduciary obligations of such bank or trust company, without any order of or other action by any court or any consent or other approval of any interested person, except as provided in subsection 5 of this section, upon the prior approval of the director and provided that the transferor and transferee comply with the provisions of this section. The assignment may encompass all fiduciary obligations, a general class or classes of fiduciary obligations, or specified individual accounts or other particularly identified fiduciary obligations.\n\n3. The transferor, transferee or any beneficiary on behalf of all beneficiaries jointly shall file an application for approval of the transfer of a fiduciary obligation with the director, and shall provide all relevant information as the director may deem necessary. The transferee shall also file proof with the director that the transferee has given written notice by certified mail of the proposed transfer, including a summary of the provisions of subsection 5 of this section relating to objections to the transfer of the fiduciary obligation, at least thirty days and not more than sixty days prior to the filing of the application, to the transferor, all persons, firms, organizations or corporations who are known to the applicant to be living or existing grantors under each affected trust or other fiduciary obligation, or if there is no such known living or existing grantor, to each living or existing beneficiary thereof known to the transferee. If any living or existing grantor or any such beneficiary delivers to the applicant any communication regarding the proposed transfer, the applicant shall furnish the director with a copy of such communication together with any accompanying documents. If the director determines that the transferee has the authority and is qualified to complete the fiduciary obligation, and that the transfer of the fiduciary obligation will not materially adversely affect the fiduciary obligation, he shall issue an order approving the transfer of the fiduciary obligation. If the director fails to approve or deny the transfer of the fiduciary obligation within thirty days of the date of the filing of the application with the director, the application shall be deemed approved by the director.\n\n4. If the director approves the transfer of a fiduciary obligation, within twenty days of the approval, the transferee shall publish a notice of the transfer of the fiduciary obligation pursuant to this section in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the transferor's main banking house or principal place of business, respectively, is located. The transfer of the fiduciary obligation shall be effective upon the thirtieth day after the date of such publication except with respect to any fiduciary obligation which upon that date is the subject of notice of objection made pursuant to subsection 5 of this section.\n\n5. Within thirty days after the publication of notice of approval by the director of the transfer of a fiduciary obligation pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, any grantor or beneficiary who was entitled to receive a written notice pursuant to subsection 3 of this section may give written notice to the transferee objecting to the transfer of the fiduciary obligation in which such person has an interest. In order to complete the transfer, the transferee may petition the probate division of the circuit court of the county or city not within a county in which the notice was published to determine whether the transfer of the fiduciary capacity will materially adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary account. After notice to all interested parties and a hearing on the issues, the circuit court may deny the relief sought by the petitioning transferee and not transfer the fiduciary obligation to the petitioning transferee, may appoint a new fiduciary to succeed the transferor if the court finds that the appointment of a new fiduciary is in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the fiduciary obligation but that the transfer of the fiduciary obligation to the petitioning transferee will materially adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary account, or shall order the transferor to transfer by assignment the fiduciary obligation to the petitioning transferee.\n\n6. On the effective date of the transfer of a fiduciary obligation pursuant to this section, the transferor shall be released from all transferred fiduciary obligations and all liability relating to such transferred fiduciary obligations, and shall cease to act regarding all such transferred fiduciary obligations, except that such transferor shall not be relieved of any liabilities arising out of a breach of a fiduciary obligation occurring prior to such effective date. The transferor shall file an itemized accounting of all assets and liabilities in each transferred fiduciary account with the transferee upon the effective date of the transfer. Notwithstanding the provision of any law or the provision of any agreement to the contrary, the transferor shall not impose fees relating to the transfer of the fiduciary obligation in excess of the actual cost to the transferor of the transfer of the fiduciary obligation. The failure by a bank or trust company to give any notice required by subsection 3 of this section with respect to any fiduciary account shall not affect the validity of the transfer of a fiduciary obligation pursuant to this section with respect to any other fiduciary obligation or account.\n\n7. Any appointment or other designation of a bank or trust company to a fiduciary obligation in a trust, will or other instrument shall be deemed to be made based only on facts and circumstances in existence on the date and at the time that the appointment or designation is made, and the director or a court, when considering the transfer of a fiduciary obligation, shall consider whether the transferee has the authority to complete the fiduciary obligation and is qualified to do so, the effect of the transfer of the fiduciary obligation including whether the transfer of the fiduciary obligation will materially adversely affect the fiduciary obligation, and whether the transfer of the fiduciary obligation is in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the fiduciary obligation.\n\n(L. 1996 S.B. 494 § 1, A.L. 2008 S.B. 788)",

The board of directors of the out-of-state bank shall file an application with the director of the division of finance, on a form to be prescribed by the director, seeking approval of its relocation to this state. The application shall contain a certification that the relocation has been approved by at least a majority of the shareholders of the out-of-state bank.\n\n3. The application shall contain articles of agreement executed as provided for other individuals seeking to incorporate a bank or trust company pursuant to this chapter, except that the articles of agreement:\n\n(1) May provide that instead of the capital stock having actually been paid up in money the capital stock is to be paid up in assets of the out-of-state bank, the net value of which is equal to at least the full amount of the capital stock of the proposed resulting bank or trust company;\n\n(2) Shall provide that the proposed resulting bank or trust company is, and shall be considered, the same business and corporate entity as, and a continuation of the corporate entity and identity of, the converting out-of-state bank although as to rights, powers and duties, the proposed resulting institution is a bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state of Missouri; and\n\n(3) Shall set out the names and addresses of all persons who are to be officers of the proposed bank or trust company.\n\n4.

If the director takes exception as to either or both matters, the director shall give notice of such exception to the majority of the board of directors of the converting out-of-state bank who shall have the same right of appeal as is provided by the laws of this state in the case of the proposed incorporators of a new bank or trust company.\n\n5. Upon the approval of the relocation and conversion, the director of the division of finance shall execute and deliver to the bank or trust company the director's certificate stating that the bank or trust company named in the certificate has been duly organized and is the institution resulting from the conversion of the out-of-state bank into the resulting bank or trust company, and that the resulting bank or trust company is, and shall be considered, the same business and corporate entity as, and a continuation of the corporate entity and identity of, the converting out-of-state bank.

When a deposit is made by any person in the name of the depositor and any one or more other persons, whether minor or adult, as joint tenants or in form to be paid to any one or more of them, or the survivor or survivors of them and whether or not the names are stated in the conjunctive or the disjunctive or otherwise, the deposit thereupon and any additions thereto made by any of these persons, upon the making thereof, shall become the property of these persons as joint tenants, and the same, together with all interest thereon, shall be held for the exclusive use of the persons so named, and may be paid to any one of such persons during his lifetime, or to any one of the survivors of them after the death of any one or more of them. The making of a deposit in such form, and the making of additions thereto, in the absence of fraud or undue influence, shall be conclusive evidence in any action or proceeding to which either the bank or trust company or any survivor is a party of the intention of all the parties to the account to vest title to the account and the additions thereto and all interest thereon in the survivor. By written instructions of all joint tenants given to the bank or trust company they may require the signatures of more than one of such persons during their lifetimes or of more than one of the survivors after the death of any one of them on any order for payment, withdrawal, check endorsement or receipt, in which case the bank shall honor orders to pay or withdrawals and make payments of interest only in accordance with such instructions, but no such instructions shall limit the right of the sole survivor or of all of the survivors to all or any part of any such deposit or interest thereon. The payment and the receipt or acquittance of the one to whom the payment is made as provided in this section shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge to the bank or trust company, whether any one or more of the persons named is dead or alive, for all payments made on account of such deposit prior to the receipt by the bank or trust company of notice in writing signed by any one of the joint tenants not to pay the deposit in accordance with the terms thereof. After receipt of such notice a bank or trust company may refuse without liability to honor any check or other order to pay, withdrawal, receipt, or to pay out any interest thereon pending determination of the rights of the parties. No bank or trust company paying any survivor in accordance with the provisions of this section shall thereby be liable for any estate, inheritance or succession taxes which may be due this state. As to any minor who is a joint tenant as provided in this section, all of the provisions of section 362.465 shall apply.\n\n2. If more than two persons are named as such depositors and one of them dies, the deposit becomes the property of the survivors as joint tenants.\n\n3. The pledge or assignment to the bank or trust company of all or part of a joint tenancy deposit or the interest thereon, signed by any joint tenant or tenants, whether minor or adult, upon whose signature or signatures withdrawals may be made from the account shall be a valid pledge or transfer to the bank or trust company of that part of the deposit pledged or assigned, and shall not operate to sever or terminate the joint tenancy of or any part of the account, subject to the effect of the pledge or assignment.\n\n4. The adjudication of incompetency of any one or more joint tenants shall not operate to sever or terminate the joint tenancy of any part of the deposit and the deposit may be withdrawn, paid out or pledged by any one or more of the joint tenants in the same manner as though the adjudication of incompetency had not been made except that any payment, withdrawal or pledge on behalf of the incompetent joint tenant shall be by his guardian.\n\n5. Any deposit made in the name of two persons or the survivor thereof who are husband and wife shall be considered a tenancy by the entirety unless otherwise specified.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 7996, A.L. 1967 p. 445, A.L. 1977 S.B. 420)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5400; 1919 § 11779\n\n(1967) A deposit made by deceased depositor and in the name of deceased depositor \"or\" his brother was not in form to be paid to either, or the survivor of them, and did not comply with this section. Ison v. Ison (Mo.), 410 S.W.2d 65.\n\n(1967) The use of the words \"as tenants by the entirety\" in relation to two persons who are not husband and wife creates no presumption of a joint tenancy. Horton v. Estate of Elmore (A.), 420 S.W.2d 48.\n\n(1967) Certificates of deposit issued to the order of deceased or defendant were not within purview of statute and created no presumption of joint tenancy with the incident of survivorship, but account which is accompanied and commemorated by an integrated, unambiguous joint tenancy deposit contract of the parties constitutes the single and final memorial of the parties which may not be varied or changed by parol evidence. Melton v. Ensley (A.), 421 S.W.2d 44.\n\n(1974) Overrules Jenkins v. Meyer and Wantuck v. United Savings and Loan Association. Held, this section creates a statutory joint tenancy and the strict common law requirements do not apply. Dietz v. Humphreys (Mo.), 507 S.W.2d 389.\n\n(1975) Held that facts did not meet requirements for statutory joint tenancy. Smith v. Thomas (A.), 520 S.W.2d 132.\n\n(1976) Where deposits and withdrawals were all made by person originally opening account and that person acting alone changed title of the account to read A or B and signature cards for a joint account were never signed, the account did not become a joint account and A's estate was entitled to proceeds. Matter of Estate of Bonacker (A.), 532 S.W.2d 898.\n\n(1980) Before statutory joint tenancy can be created in bank account, there must be deposit made in name of depositor and any one or more other persons, and it must be made in form to be paid to any one or more of them. Thummel v. Thummel (A.), 609 S.W.2d 175.\n\n(1980) Where statute creating joint account is not complied with, but bank deposit is payable to husband and wife, but account is not in their names as husband and wife, account is presumed to be held in estate by entirety whether husband or wife or both furnished monies that went into account.

Banks exempt from furnishing security for insured deposits — single bank pooling of securities, administrator, requirements. —1. Notwithstanding any provision of law of this state or of any political subdivision thereof requiring security for deposits in the form of collateral, surety bond or in any other form, security for such deposits shall not be required to the extent said deposits are insured under the provisions of an act of congress creating and establishing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar agency created and established by the Congress of the United States.\n\n2. (1) As an alternative to the requirements for direct pledging of security for deposit of public funds in excess of the amount that is federally insured or guaranteed pursuant to sections 110.010, 110.020, and 110.060, a banking institution authorized as legal depositary for public funds may secure the deposits of any governmental entity by granting a security interest in a single pool of securities to secure the repayment of all public funds deposited in the banking institution by such governmental entities and not otherwise federally insured or secured pursuant to law.\n\n(2) A banking institution may secure the deposit of public funds using the direct method as provided in chapter 110, or the single-bank-pooled method provided in this section, or may elect to offer government entities the choice of either method to secure the deposit of public funds.\n\n(3) Under the direct method, a banking institution may secure the deposit of public funds of each government entity separately by furnishing securities pursuant to sections 110.010, 110.020, and 110.060.\n\n(4) Under the single-bank-pooled method, a banking institution may secure the deposit of public funds of one or more government entities through a pool of eligible securities held in custody and safekeeping with one or more other banking institutions or safe depositaries, to be held subject to the order of the director of the division of finance or the administrator appointed pursuant to subsection 3 of this section for the benefit of the government entities having public funds deposited with such banking institution as set forth in this section.\n\n3. (1) The director of the division of finance shall have exclusive authority to appoint a bank, trust company, or association for Missouri banks which is chartered or incorporated in Missouri, to serve as the administrator with respect to a single-bank-pooled method. The administrator shall act as an agent for banking institutions and as the nominee of the government entities for purposes of administering the pool of securities pledged to secure uninsured public fund deposits. The fees and expenses of such administrator shall be paid by the banking institutions utilizing the single-bank-pooled method. The single-bank-pooled method shall not be utilized by any banking institution unless an administrator has been appointed by the director pursuant to this section and is acting as the administrator. The director may require the administrator to post a surety bond or security to the director in an amount up to one hundred thousand dollars to assure the faithful performance of the duties of the administrator.\n\n(2) At all times the aggregate market value of the pool of securities so deposited, pledged, or in which a security interest is granted shall be at least equal to one hundred two percent of the amount on deposit which is in excess of the amount so insured.\n\n(3) Each banking institution shall carry on its accounting records at all times a general ledger or other appropriate account of the total amount of all public funds to be secured by the pool of securities as determined at the opening of business each day, and the aggregate market value of the pool of securities pledged, or in which a security interest is granted to secure such public funds.\n\n(4) If a banking institution elects to secure the deposit of public funds through the use of the single-bank-pooled method, such banking institution shall notify the administrator in writing that it has elected to utilize the single-bank-pooled method and the proposed effective date thereof and enter such agreement as the administrator may require.\n\n(5) A banking institution may not retain any deposit of public funds which is required to be secured unless it has secured the deposits for the benefit of the government entities having public funds with such banking institution pursuant to this section.\n\n(6) Only the securities and collateral described or listed pursuant to section 30.270 for the safekeeping and payment of deposits by the state treasurer may be provided and accepted as security for the deposit of public funds and shall be eligible as collateral. The administrator shall not accept any securities which are not described or listed pursuant to section 30.270.\n\n(7) The administrator may establish such procedures and reporting requirements as necessary for depository banking institutions and their safekeeping banks or depositaries to confirm the amount of insured public fund deposits, the pledge of securities to the administrator to secure the deposit of public funds, as agent for each participating banking institution, and to monitor the market value of pledged securities as reported by the custody agents, and to add, substitute, or remove securities held in the single bank pool as directed by the depository banking institution.\n\n(8) In the event of the failure and insolvency of a banking institution using the single-bank-pooled method, subject to any order of the director pursuant to powers vested under chapter 361, the administrator shall direct the safekeeping banks or depositaries to sell the pledged securities and direct proceeds to the payment of the uninsured public fund deposits or to transfer the pledged securities to that banking institution's primary supervisory agency or the duly appointed receiver for the banking institution to be liquidated to pay out the uninsured public fund deposits.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 8000, A.L. 2025 H.B. 754 merged with S.B. 98)",

Any trust company may be appointed conservator, trustee, personal representative, receiver, assignee or in any other fiduciary capacity, in the manner now provided by law for appointment of individuals to any such office. On the application of any natural person acting in any such office, or on the application of any natural persons acting jointly in any such office, any trust company may be appointed by the court or officer having jurisdiction in the place and stead of the person or persons; or on the application of the person or persons any trust company may be appointed to the office to act jointly with the person or persons theretofore appointed, or appointed at the same time; provided, the appointment shall not increase the compensation to be paid the joint fiduciaries over the amount pursuant to the law payable to a fiduciary acting alone.\n\n4.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, a bank, trust company or affiliate thereof, when acting as a trustee, investment advisor, custodian, or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the investment and reinvestment of assets may invest and reinvest the assets, subject to the standards contained in section 456.8-816 and sections 469.900 to 469.913, in the securities of any open-end or closed-end management investment company or investment trust registered pursuant to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (15 U.S.C. Sections 80a-1, et seq.) (collectively, \"mutual funds\"), or in shares or interests in a partnership or limited liability company or other entity that operates as a privately offered investment fund. Such investment and reinvestment of assets may be made notwithstanding that such bank, trust company, or affiliate provides services to the investment company or trust or privately offered investment fund as investment advisor, sponsor, distributor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, or otherwise, and receives reasonable remuneration for such services. Such bank or trust company or affiliate thereof is entitled to receive fiduciary fees with respect to such assets. For such services the bank or trust company or affiliate thereof shall be entitled only to the normal fiduciary fee but neither a bank, trust company nor affiliate shall be required to reduce or waive its compensation for services provided in connection with the investment and management of assets because the fiduciary invests, reinvests or retains assets in a mutual fund or privately offered investment fund. The provisions of this subsection apply to any trust, advisory, custody or other fiduciary relationship established before or after August 28, 1999, unless the governing instrument refers to this section and provides otherwise.\n\n12.

The term\"out-of-state bank or trust company\", as used in this section, shall mean:\n\n(1) Any bank or trust company now or hereafter organized under the laws of any state of the United States other than Missouri; and\n\n(2) Any national banking association or any thrift institution under the jurisdiction of the office of the comptroller of the currency having its principal place of business in any state of the United States other than Missouri.\n\n2. Except as provided in subsections 4 and 6 of this section, any out-of-state bank or trust company may act in this state as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or in any other like fiduciary capacity, without the necessity of complying with any law of this state relating to the licensing of foreign banking corporations by the director of finance or relating to the qualifications of foreign corporations to do business in this state, and notwithstanding any prohibition, limitation or restriction contained in any other law of this state, provided only that:\n\n(1) The out-of-state bank or trust company is authorized to act in this fiduciary capacity or capacities in the state in which it is incorporated, or, if the out-of-state bank or trust company be a national banking association, or a thrift institution, it is authorized to act in this fiduciary capacity or capacities in the state in which it has its principal place of business; and\n\n(2) Any bank or other corporation organized under the laws of this state or a national banking association or thrift institution having its principal place of business in this state may act in these fiduciary capacities in that state without further showing or qualification, other than that it is authorized to act in these fiduciary capacities in this state, compliance with minimum capital, bonding, or securities pledge requirements applicable to all banks and trust companies doing business in that state, and compliance with any law of that state concerning service of process:\n\n(a) Which may require the appointment of an official or other person for the receipt of process; or\n\n(b) Which contains provisions to the effect that any bank or trust company which is not incorporated under the laws of that state, or if a national bank or thrift institution then which does not have its principal place of business in that state, acting in that state in a fiduciary capacity pursuant to provisions of law making it eligible to do so, shall be deemed to have appointed an official of that state to be its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all legal process in any action or proceeding against it relating to or growing out of any trust, estate or matter in respect of which the entity has acted or is acting in that state in this fiduciary capacity, and that the acceptance of or engagement in that state in any acts in this fiduciary capacity shall be deemed its agreement that the process against it, which is so served, shall be of the same legal force and validity as though served upon it personally, or which contains any substantially similar provisions.\n\n3. Any out-of-state bank or trust company eligible to act in any fiduciary capacity in this state pursuant to the provisions of this section may so act whether or not a resident of this state be acting with it in this capacity, may use its corporate name in connection with such activity in this state, and may be appointed to act in this fiduciary capacity by any court having jurisdiction in the premises, all notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to prohibit or make unlawful any activity in this state by a bank or trust company which is not incorporated under the laws of this state, or if a national bank or thrift institution then which does not have its principal place of business in this state, which would be lawful in the absence of this section.\n\n4. Except as provided in subsection 6 of this section, prior to the time when any out-of-state bank or trust company acts pursuant to the authority of this section in any fiduciary capacity or capacities in this state, the out-of-state bank or trust company shall file with the director of finance a written application for a certificate of reciprocity and the director of finance shall issue the certificate to the out-of-state bank or trust company. The application shall state the information set forth in the following subdivisions (1) to (7), and the out-of-state bank or trust company shall be subject to the following subdivisions (8) to (10):\n\n(1) The correct corporate name of the out-of-state bank or trust company;\n\n(2) The name of the state under the laws of which it is incorporated, or if the out-of-state bank or trust company is a national banking association or thrift institution shall state that fact;\n\n(3) The address of its principal business office;\n\n(4) In what fiduciary capacity or capacities it desires to act, in the state of Missouri;\n\n(5) Whether the out-of-state bank or trust company intends to establish a trust representative office, facility, branch, or other physical location in the state of Missouri and the activities to be conducted at such office, facility, branch, or location;\n\n(6) That it is authorized to act in a similar fiduciary capacity or capacities in the state in which it is incorporated, or, if it is a national banking association, in which it has its principal place of business;\n\n(7) That the application shall constitute the irrevocable appointment of the director of finance of Missouri as its true and lawful attorney to receive service of all legal process in any action or proceeding against it relating to or growing out of any trust, estate or matter in respect of which the out-of-state bank or trust company may act in this state in the fiduciary capacity pursuant to the certificate of reciprocity applied for;\n\n(8) Subject to subdivision (10) of this subsection unless the out-of-state bank or trust company verifies to the director of the division of finance that it satisfies capital requirements equal to the new charter requirement for a Missouri trust company or that it maintains a bond for the faithful performance of all its fiduciary activities equivalent to the Missouri capital requirements, the director may require the applicant to submit a bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Missouri in the minimum amount of one million dollars in a form or such greater amount acceptable to the director of the division of finance. The surety bond shall secure the faithful performance of the fiduciary obligations of the out-of-state bank or trust company in Missouri;\n\n(9) The application shall be verified by an officer of the out-of-state bank or trust company, and there shall be filed with it such certificates of public officials and copies of documents certified by public officials as may be necessary to show that the out-of-state bank or trust company is authorized to act in a fiduciary capacity or capacities similar to those in which it desires to act in the state of Missouri, in the state in which it is incorporated, or, if it is a national banking association in which it has its principal place of business. The director of finance shall, thereupon, if the out-of-state bank or trust company is one which may act in the fiduciary capacity or capacities as provided in subsection 2 of this section, issue to the entity a certificate of reciprocity. The certificate of reciprocity shall recite and certify that the out-of-state bank or trust company is eligible to act in this state pursuant to this section and shall recite the fiduciary capacity or capacities in which the out-of-state bank or trust company is eligible so to act;\n\n(10) Notwithstanding subdivision (8) of this subsection, to facilitate interstate reciprocity under this section, the director may enter a memorandum of understanding with the bank or trust company regulator of another jurisdiction to accept the capital requirements of that jurisdiction in lieu of the Missouri minimum capital or bond requirements set forth in subdivision (8) of this subsection and establish such other terms to assure reciprocal interstate treatment for Missouri chartered bank or trust companies in that jurisdiction.\n\n5. A certificate of reciprocity issued to any out-of-state bank or trust company shall remain in effect until the out-of-state bank or trust company shall cease to be entitled under subsection 2 of this section to act in this state in the fiduciary capacity or capacities covered by the certificate, and thereafter until revoked by the director of finance. If at any time the out-of-state bank or trust company shall cease to be entitled under subsection 2 of this section to act in this state in the fiduciary capacity or capacities covered by the certificate, the director of finance shall revoke the certificate and give written notice of the revocation to the out-of-state bank or trust company. No revocation of any certificate of reciprocity shall affect the right of the out-of-state bank or trust company to continue to act in this state in a fiduciary capacity in estates or matters in which it has theretofore begun to act in a fiduciary capacity pursuant to the certificate.\n\n6. An out-of-state bank or trust company shall not establish or maintain a trust representative office, facility, branch, or other physical location in this state for the conduct of business as a fiduciary unless:\n\n(1) The out-of-state bank or trust company is under the control of a Missouri bank or a Missouri bank holding company and the out-of-state bank or trust company has complied with the requirements relating to the qualifications of out-of-state bank or trust company to do business in this state;\n\n(2) The out-of-state bank or trust company is a bank, trust company or national banking association in good standing that possesses fiduciary powers from its chartering authority and is the surviving corporation to a merger or consolidation with a national banking association located in Missouri or a Missouri bank or trust company or is otherwise authorized by federal law to establish a branch in Missouri. The provisions of this subdivision are enacted to implement subsection 2 of this section and section 362.610, and the provisions of Title 12, U.S.C. Section 36 of the National Bank Act and other applicable federal law; or\n\n(3) The out-of-state bank or trust company is a state-chartered bank, savings and loan association, trust company, national banking association, or thrift institution in good standing that possesses fiduciary powers and has received a certificate of reciprocity, in which case it may open a trust representative office, facility, branch, or other physical location in Missouri, provided a bank, savings and loan association or trust company chartered under the laws of Missouri and a national bank or thrift institution with its principal location in Missouri, all with fiduciary powers, are permitted to open and operate such a trust representative office, facility, branch, or other physical location under the same or less restrictive conditions in the state in which the out-of-state bank or trust company is organized or has its principal office.\n\n7. An out-of-state bank or trust company, insofar as it acts in a fiduciary capacity in this state pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall not be deemed to be transacting business in this state, if the out-of-state bank or trust company does not establish or maintain in this state a place of business, branch office, or agency for the conduct in this state of business as a fiduciary.\n\n8. Every out-of-state bank or trust company to which a certificate of reciprocity shall have been issued shall be deemed to have appointed the director of finance to be its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all legal process in any action or proceeding against it relating to or growing out of any trust, estate or matter in respect of which the out-of-state bank or trust company acts in this state in any fiduciary capacity pursuant to the certificate of reciprocity. Service of the process shall be made by delivering a copy of the summons or other process, with a copy of the petition when service of the copy is required by law, to the director of finance or to any person in his or her office authorized by him to receive the service. The director of finance shall immediately forward the process, together with the copy of the petition, if any, to the out-of-state bank or trust company, by registered mail, addressed to it at the address on file with the director, or if there be none on file then at its last known address. The director of finance shall keep a permanent record in his or her office showing for all such process served, the style of the action or proceeding, the court in which it was brought, the name and title of the officer serving the process, the day and hour of service, and the day of mailing by registered mail to the out-of-state bank or trust company and the address to which mailed. In case the process is issued by a court, the same may be directed to and served by any officer authorized to serve process in the city or county where the director of finance shall have his or her office, at least fifteen days before the return thereof. If an out-of-state bank or trust company has established a trust representative office, trust facility, branch, or other physical location in the state of Missouri, that bank or trust company may also be served legal process at any such location by service upon any officer, agent, or employee at that location.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 445, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1092, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1571, A.L. 2000 S.B. 896, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1511, A.L. 2005 H.B. 707, A.L. 2015 H.B. 1098, A.L. 2019 S.B. 179)\n\n(Source: RSMo 1959 § 363.205)",
