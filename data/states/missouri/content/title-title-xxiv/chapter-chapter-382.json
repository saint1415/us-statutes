Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may invest in, otherwise acquire or operate one or more subsidiaries engaged or registered to engage in one or more of the following businesses:\n\n(1) Any kind of insurance business authorized by the laws of the state of Missouri;\n\n(2) Investing, reinvesting or trading in securities for its own account, that of its parent, any subsidiary of its parent, or any affiliate or subsidiary;\n\n(3) Rendering other services including, but not limited to, actuarial, loss prevention, safety engineering, marketing, data processing, accounting, claims, appraisal and collection services, if such services relate to the operations of the insurance business of the insurer; provided, however, that such services shall not include services of salvage of motor vehicles, the mechanical, body or other repair of motor vehicles and the towing or retrieval of motor vehicles;\n\n(4) Ownership and management of the kinds of assets which the parent corporation could itself own or manage;\n\n(5) Acting as administrative agent for a governmental instrumentality which is performing an insurance function;\n\n(6) Financing of insurance premiums;\n\n(7) Any other business activity determined by the director to be reasonably ancillary to the insurance business of the insurer;\n\n(8) Owning a corporation or corporations engaged in or organized to engage exclusively in one or more of the businesses specified in this section;\n\n(9) Acting as an insurance broker or as an insurance agent for its parent or for any of its parent's insurer subsidiaries;\n\n(10) Management of any investment company subject to or registered pursuant to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, including related sales and services;\n\n(11) Acting as a broker-dealer subject to or registered pursuant to the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and\n\n(12) Rendering investment advice to governments, government agencies, corporations or other organizations or groups.\n\n2. In addition, a domestic insurance company may, if it maintains books and records which separately account for such business, engage directly in any business referred to in subdivisions (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of subsection 1 of this section, either to the extent necessarily or properly incidental to the insurance business the insurer is authorized to do in this state or to the extent approved by the director and subject to any limitations the director may prescribe for the protection of the interests of the policyholders of the insurer after taking into account the effect of such business on the insurer's existing insurance business and its surplus, the proposed allocation of the estimated costs of such business and the risks inherent in such business as well as the relative advantages to the insurer and its policyholders of conducting such business directly instead of through a subsidiary. Nothing in sections 382.010 to 382.300 shall be deemed to limit the powers of a domestic insurance company existing prior to September 28, 1971.\n\n3. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted domestic insurers, a domestic insurer may also do one or more of the following:\n\n(1) Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent of such insurer's assets or fifty percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, if after such investments the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investment, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:\n\n(a) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and\n\n(b) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;\n\n(2) With the approval of the director, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, if after such investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs;\n\n(3) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided that each such subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection or in other insurance laws applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this subdivision, the total investment of the insurer shall include:\n\n(a) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and\n\n(b) The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of such subsidiary.\n\n4. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities made pursuant to subsection 3 of this section shall be made as provided by the statutes of this state.\n\n5. Whether any investment pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 of this section meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined immediately after such investment is made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the date they are made.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 101 §§ 2, 3, 4, A.L. 1987 S.B. 337, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 2014 S.B. 794)\n\nCROSS REFERENCES:\n\nBi-state development agency, bonds of, investment in authorized, 70.377\n\nMultinational banks, securities and obligations of, investment in, when, 409.950\n\nSavings accounts in insured savings and loan associations, investment in authorized, 369.194",

Acquisitions where change of control of insurer, subject to order, when — contents, requirements — violations, penalties. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Acquisition\", any agreement, arrangement or activity the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes but is not limited to the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers;\n\n(2)\"Involved insurer\"includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired or is the result of a merger.\n\n2. Except as provided in this subsection, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state. This section shall not apply to the following:\n\n(1) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes so long as such securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under subdivision (2) of section 382.010, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of insurance or other appropriate person of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and such disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by such person to the director;\n\n(2) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the director in accordance with subsection 3 of this section thirty days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition; however, such preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other subdivision of this subsection;\n\n(3) The acquisition of already affiliated persons;\n\n(4) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:\n\n(a) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed five percent of the total market;\n\n(b) There would be no increase in any market share; or\n\n(c) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed twelve percent of the total market, and the market share of the involved insurer after the acquisition would increase by two percent of the total market or less.\n\n­­For the purpose of this subdivision, a\"market\"means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state;\n\n(5) An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business;\n\n(6) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner or other appropriate person affirmatively finds that such insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition; the public benefits of improving such insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and such findings are communicated by such person to the director.\n\n3. An acquisition covered by subsection 2 of this section may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection 5 of this section, unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period described in this subsection has expired. The acquired person or acquiring person may file a preacquisition notification. The director shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection. The preacquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subdivision (4) of subsection 2 of this section cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The director may require such additional material and information as he or she deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection 4 of this section. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion. The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt by the director of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of such receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the director. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the director on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of such additional information by the director or termination of the waiting period by the director.\n\n4. (1) The director may enter an order under subsection 5 of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection 3 of this section.\n\n(2) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the director shall consider the following:\n\n(a) Any acquisition covered under subsection 2 of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards:\n\na. If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following share of the market:\n\nb. If the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following share of the market:\n\n­­A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are to be interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subdivision (1) of this subsection. For the purpose of this subdivision, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be insurer A;\n\n(b) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five to ten years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection 2 of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in subdivision (1) of this subsection if:\n\na. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;\n\nb. One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of such large insurers showing the requisite seven percent or more increase in the market share; and\n\nc. Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more.\n\n(3) For the purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection:\n\n(a) The term\"insurer\"includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control;\n\n(b) The term\"market\"means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the director shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state;\n\n(c) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the director.\n\n(4) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the director may establish that the requisite anticompetitive effect exists based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subdivision (2) of this subsection, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect, based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subdivision include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(5) An order shall not be entered under subsection 5 of this section if:\n\n(a) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource use that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or\n\n(b) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of such increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.\n\n5. If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the director may enter an order:\n\n(1) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or\n\n(2) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.\n\n­­Such an order shall not be entered unless there is a hearing, notice of such hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing, and the hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than sixty days after the end of the waiting period. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the director setting forth his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law. An order entered under this subsection shall not become final earlier than thirty days after it is issued, during which time any involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such plan or other information, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified. An order issued pursuant to this subsection shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.\n\n6. Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the director under subsection 5 of this section, and while such order is in effect, may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the director, be subject at the discretion of the director to any one or more of the following:\n\n(1) A monetary penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for every day of violation; or\n\n(2) Suspension or revocation of such person's license.\n\n7. Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any such filing requirement shall be subject to a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\n8. Sections 382.260 and 382.280 do not apply to acquisitions covered by subsection 2 of this section.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al., A.L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 2015 H.B. 50)",

Internationally active insurance group, director to act as supervisor or acknowledge another regulatory authority as supervisor, when — duties, activities — rulemaking authority. —1. The director is authorized to act as the groupwide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with the provisions of this section. However, the director may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the groupwide supervisor if the internationally active insurance group:\n\n(1) Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;\n\n(2) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States but not in this state; or\n\n(3) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and in this state but the director has determined, pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections 3 and 9 of this section, that another regulatory official is the appropriate groupwide supervisor.\n\n2. An insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the director make a determination or acknowledgment as to a groupwide supervisor pursuant to this section.\n\n3. In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the director shall identify a single groupwide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The director may determine that the director is the appropriate groupwide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state. However, the director may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate groupwide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The director shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:\n\n(1) The domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that hold the largest share of the internationally active insurance group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities;\n\n(2) The domicile of the top-tiered insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(3) The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;\n\n(4) Whether another regulatory official is acting as or is seeking to act as the groupwide supervisor under a regulatory system that the director determines to be:\n\n(a) Substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of this state; or\n\n(b) Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for groupwide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and\n\n(5) Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the groupwide supervisor provides the director with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.\n\n4. A director identified under this section as the groupwide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another regulatory official to serve as the groupwide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the groupwide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (5) of subsection 3 of this section, and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group, and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.\n\n5. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, when another regulatory official is acting as the groupwide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the director shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the groupwide supervisor, subject to subsection 6 of this section. In the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in either the internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in this state holding the largest share of the internationally active insurance group's premiums, assets, or liabilities, or this state being the domicile of the top-tiered insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group, the director shall make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate groupwide supervisor for such an internationally active insurance group under subsections 3 and 4 of this section.\n\n6. In the event of a dispute as to the proper regulatory official to act as groupwide supervisor, a determination by the director not to acknowledge the current groupwide supervisor shall be made only after notice and a public hearing, and such determination shall be accompanied by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law including, but not limited to, application of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (5) of subsection 3 of this section.\n\n7. Under section 382.220, the director is authorized to collect from any insurer registered under sections 382.100 to 382.180 all information necessary to determine whether the director may act as the groupwide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the director may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the groupwide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to groupwide supervision by the director, the director shall notify the insurer registered under sections 382.100 to 382.180 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have not less than thirty days to provide the director with additional information pertinent to the pending determination. The director shall publish on the department's website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the director has determined are subject to groupwide supervision by the director.\n\n8. If the director is the groupwide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the director is authorized to engage in any of the following groupwide supervisory activities:\n\n(1) Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:\n\n(a) The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and\n\n(b) Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;\n\n(2) Request, from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the director's supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk including, but not limited to, information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:\n\n(a) Governance, risk assessment, and management;\n\n(b) Capital adequacy; and\n\n(c) Material intercompany transactions;\n\n(3) Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of such internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;\n\n(4) Communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 382.230, through supervisory colleges as set forth in section 382.225 or otherwise;\n\n(5) Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under sections 382.100 to 382.180, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the director's role as groupwide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. Such agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and\n\n(6) Other groupwide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated in this subsection, as considered necessary by the director.\n\n9. If the director acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is the groupwide supervisor, the director is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with groupwide supervision undertaken by the groupwide supervisor, provided that:\n\n(1) The director's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state; and\n\n(2) The regulatory official acknowledged as the groupwide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the director's activities as a groupwide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable. Where such recognition and cooperation are not reasonably reciprocal, the director is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.\n\n10. The director is authorized to enter into agreements with, or obtain documentation from, any insurer registered under sections 382.100 to 382.180, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, regarding members of the internationally active insurance group, which provides the basis for or otherwise clarifies a regulatory official's role as groupwide supervisor.\n\n11. The director may promulgate regulations necessary for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable, and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2019, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12. An insurer registered under sections 382.100 to 382.180 and subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the director's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagements of attorneys, actuaries, and any other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.\n\n(L. 2019 S.B. 54)",

In order to assist in the performance of the director's duties, the director:\n\n(1) May share documents, materials, or other information including the confidential and privileged documents, materials, or other information subject to subsection 1 of this section, including proprietary and trade secret documents and materials, with other state, federal, and international financial regulatory agencies, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, with any third-party consultants designated by the director, and with state, federal, and international law enforcement authorities including members of any supervisory college described in section 382.225; provided that the recipient agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of such documents, materials, or other information, and has verified in writing the legal authority to maintain confidentiality;\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section and subdivision (1) of this subsection, may share confidential and privileged documents, materials, or other information reported under section 382.175 only with the directors of states having statutes or regulations substantially similar to subsection 1 of this section and who have agreed in writing not to disclose such information;\n\n(3) May receive documents, materials, or other information including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, including proprietary and trade secret information, from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries and from regulatory and law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any documents, materials, or other information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or other information; and\n\n(4) Shall enter into a written agreement with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and any third-party consultant designated by the director governing sharing and use of information provided under sections 382.010 to 382.300 consistent with this subsection that shall:\n\n(a) Specify procedures and protocols regarding the confidentiality and security of information shared with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant designated by the director under sections 382.010 to 382.300 including procedures and protocols for sharing by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners with other state, federal, and international regulators. The agreement shall provide that the recipient agrees, in writing, to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the documents, materials, or other information and has verified, also in writing, the legal authority to maintain such confidentiality;\n\n(b) Specify that ownership of information shared with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant as designated by the director under sections 382.010 to 382.300 remains with the director and that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' or third-party consultant's, as designated by the director, use of such information is subject to the direction of the director;\n\n(c) Excluding documents, material, or information reported pursuant to section 382.177, prohibit the NAIC or a third-party consultant designated by the director from storing the information shared under sections 382.010 to 382.300 in a permanent database after the underlying analysis is completed;\n\n(d) Require prompt notice to be given to an insurer whose confidential information in the possession of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant designated by the director under sections 382.010 to 382.300 is subject to a request or subpoena to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant designated by the director, for disclosure or production;\n\n(e) Require the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or third-party consultant as designated by the director to consent to intervention by an insurer in any judicial or administrative action in which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or third-party consultant as designated by the director may be required to disclose confidential information about the insurer shared with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant designated by the director, and its affiliates and subsidiaries under sections 382.010 to 382.300; and\n\n(f) For documents, material, or information reporting under section 382.177, in the case of an agreement involving a third-party consultant designated by the director, provide for notification of the identity of the consultant to the applicable insurers.\n\n4. The sharing of information by the director under sections 382.010 to 382.300 shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory or rulemaking authority, and the director is solely responsible for the administration, execution, and enforcement of the provisions of sections 382.010 to 382.300.\n\n5. No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials, or other information shall occur as a result of disclosure of such documents, materials, or other information to the director under this section or as a result of sharing as authorized in sections 382.010 to 382.300.\n\n6. Documents, materials, or other information in the possession or control of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a third-party consultant designated by the director under sections 382.010 to 382.300 shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure under chapter 610, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.\n\n7. The group capital calculation and resulting group capital ratio required under section 382.176 and the liquidity stress test along with its results and supporting disclosures required under section 382.177 are regulatory tools for assessing group risks and capital adequacy and group liquidity risks, respectively, and are not intended as a means to rank insurers or insurance holding company systems generally. Therefore, except as otherwise may be required under sections 382.010 to 382.300, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing directly or indirectly to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station or any electronic means of communication available to the public, or in any other way as an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing a representation or statement with regard to the group capital calculation, group capital ratio, the liquidity stress test results, or supporting disclosures for the liquidity stress test of any insurer or any insurer group, or of any component derived in the calculation by any insurer, broker, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business, would be misleading and is therefore prohibited; provided, however, that if any materially false statement with respect to the group capital calculation, resulting group capital ratio, an inappropriate comparison of any amount to an insurer's or insurance group's group capital calculation or resulting group capital ratio, liquidity stress test result, supporting disclosures for the liquidity stress test, or an inappropriate comparison of any amount to an insurer's or insurance group's liquidity stress test result or supporting disclosures is published in any written publication and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the director with substantial proof the falsity of such statement or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the insurer may publish announcements in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.\n\n(L. 1971 S.B. 101 § 26, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1574, A.L. 2015 H.B. 50, A.L. 2019 S.B. 54, A.L. 2021 S.B. 6)",

Notwithstanding any request from the director made under subsection 3 of this section, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the director or commissioner of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the NAIC. An insurer that is a member of an insurance group, however, shall not be required to submit the report required by this section to the director until the earlier of the adoption of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and National Association of Insurance Commissioners Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulations by the lead state of such insurance group, or June 1, 2020.\n\n2.

For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling person level, an intermediate holding company level, or the individual legal entity level depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer or insurance group's risk appetite is determined; or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors is coordinated and exercised; or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in level of reporting.\n\n5.
