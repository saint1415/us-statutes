Any person may purchase or acquire or agree to purchase or acquire from any seller any contract on such terms and conditions and at such price as may be agreed upon between them. Filing of the assignment notice to the buyer of the assignment, and any requirement that the holder maintain dominion over the payments or the motor vehicle if repossessed shall not be necessary to the validity of a written assignment of a contract as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledges, mortgages and lien claimants of the seller. Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his contract, payment thereunder made by the buyer to the last known holder of the contract shall be binding upon all subsequent holders.\n\n2. The holder of a retail installment contract upon request by the buyer may agree to an amendment thereto to extend or defer the scheduled due date of all or any part of any installment or installments to renew, restate or reschedule the unpaid balance of such contract, and may collect for same a refinance charge not to exceed an amount computed as follows: If all or any part of any installment or installments is deferred for not more than two months the holder may at his election charge and collect on the amount deferred for the period deferred a refinance charge computed at a rate which will not exceed the same yield as is permitted on monthly payment contracts under subsection 1 of section 365.120; provided that the minimum deferment charge shall be one dollar. Such amendment may also include payment by the buyer of the additional cost to the holder of premiums for continuing in force any insurance coverages provided for in the contract and any additional necessary official fees. In any other extension, renewal, restatement or rescheduling of the unpaid balance, the refinance charge may be computed as follows: the sum of the unpaid balance as of the refinancing date and the cost for any insurance and other benefits incidental to the refinancing, any additional necessary official fees, and any accrued delinquency and collection charges, after deducting a refund credit as for prepayment pursuant to section 365.140, shall constitute a principal balance, the refinance charge may be computed for the term of the refinanced contract at the applicable rate for finance charges provided in subsection 1 of section 365.120 obtained by reclassifying the motor vehicle by its year model at the time of the refinancing. The provisions of this chapter relating to minimum finance charges under subsection 2 of section 365.120 and acquisition costs under the refund schedule in section 365.140 shall not apply in calculating refinance charges. The amendment to the contract must be confirmed in a writing which shall set forth the terms of the amendment and the new due dates and amounts of the installments, and shall either be delivered to the buyer or mailed to him at his address as shown on the contract. Said writing together with the original contract and any previous amendments thereto shall constitute the retail installment contract.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and upon request by the buyer, the holder of a retail installment contract may agree to an amendment thereto to extend or defer the scheduled due dates on such contract with an original amount of six hundred dollars or more, and provided the debtor agrees in writing, the holder may collect a fee in advance for allowing the debtor to defer monthly payments on the credit so long as the fee on each deferred period is no more than the lesser of fifty dollars or ten percent of the loan payments deferred; however, a minimum fee of twenty-five dollars is permitted. In addition, under this subsection no extensions shall be made until the first recurring monthly payment is collected on any one extension of credit, the original time price differential paid to the holder on the retail installment contract remains the same and this subsection applies only to nonprecomputed extensions of credit.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 466 § 12, A.L. 2005 H.B. 248)",
