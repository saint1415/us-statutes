      "text": "Title XXIV BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nChapter 379\n\n379.203. Automobile liability policy, required provisions — uninsured motorist coverage required — recovery against tort-feasor, how limited. —1. No automobile liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto, or in the case of any commercial motor vehicle, as defined in section 301.010, any employer having a fleet of five or more passenger vehicles, such coverage is offered therein or supplemental thereto, in not less than the limits for bodily injury or death set forth in section 303.030, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death, resulting therefrom. Such legal entitlement exists although the identity of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle cannot be established because such owner or operator and the motor vehicle departed the scene of the occurrence occasioning such bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death, before identification. It also exists whether or not physical contact was made between the uninsured motor vehicle and the insured or the insured's motor vehicle. Provisions affording such insurance protection against uninsured motorists issued in this state prior to October 13, 1967, shall, when afforded by any authorized insurer, be deemed, subject to the limits prescribed in this section, to satisfy the requirements of this section.\n\n2. For the purpose of this coverage, the term\"uninsured motor vehicle\"shall, subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, be deemed to include an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified herein because of insolvency.\n\n3. An insurer's insolvency protection shall be applicable only to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured's uninsured motorist coverage is in effect where the liability insurer of the tort-feasor becomes insolvent within two years after such an accident. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any insurer from affording insolvency protection under terms and conditions more favorable to its insureds than is provided hereunder.\n\n4. In the event of payment to any person under the coverage required by this section, and subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, the insurer making such payment shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such person against any person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury for which such payment is made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer; provided, however, with respect to payments made by reason of the coverage described in subsections 2 and 3 above, the insurer making such payment shall not be entitled to any right of recovery against such tort-feasor in excess of the proceeds recovered from the assets of the insolvent insurer of said tort-feasor.\n\n5. In any action on a policy of automobile liability insurance coverage providing for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles, the fact that the owner or operator of such uninsured motor vehicle whether known or unknown failed to file the report required by section 303.040 shall be prima facie evidence of uninsured status, and such failure to file may be established by a statement of the absence of such a report on file with the office of the director of revenue, certified by the director, which statement shall be received in evidence in any of the courts of this state. In any such action, the report required by section 303.040, when filed by the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, shall be prima facie evidence of lack of insurance coverage and the report, or a copy thereof, certified by the director of revenue, may be introduced into evidence in accordance with section 303.310.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 516, A.L. 1971 H.B. 85, A.L. 1972 S.B. 458, A.L. 1982 S.B. 480, A.L. 1991 H.B. 385, et al.)\n\n(1974) Held that where vehicle was run off road without actual contact uninsured motorist coverage would apply if vehicle which ran plaintiff off the road could be positively identified and was in fact an uninsured motorist. Ward v. Allstate Insurance Co. (Mo.), 514 S.W.2d 576.\n\n(1975) Where insured was passenger in his car and car was being driven by insured's brother who carried no insurance, insured was denied recovery under the uninsured motorist provisions of his policy after single automobile accident. Term \"uninsured motor vehicle\" requires insurers to protect their insureds only from collisions with other vehicles lacking liability coverage. Miles v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (A.), 519 S.W.2d 378.\n\n(1975) Insuror is entitled to reimbursement, up to the amount it has paid under uninsured motorist coverage, from recovery had against uninsured motorist. State Farm ex. rel. Manchester Insurance and Indemnity Co. v. Moss (Mo.), 522 S.W.2d 772.\n\n(1975) Holder of two policies on two different vehicles is entitled to \"stack\" uninsured motorist coverage of both policies if necessary to satisfy judgment. Galloway v. Farmers Insurance Company, In. (A.), 523 S.W.2d 339.\n\n(1975) \"Uninsured motor vehicle\" does not mean underinsured vehicle. Mere fact that multiple claims greatly reduced coverage available to claimant does not allow him to come under uninsured motorist provision of his own policy. Brake v. MFA Mutual Insurance Company (A.), 525 S.W.2d 109.\n\n(1975) Passenger in automobile is not a user within the policy provisions covering person \"using\" the insured automobile and is not covered under uninsured motorist coverage. Waltz v. Cameron Mutual Insurance Co. (A.), 526 S.W.2d 340.\n\n(1976) Public policy expressed in this section prohibited insurer from limiting recovery by insured to only one of two separate uninsured motorist coverages, included in one policy and for which separate premiums were charged, one for each of two cars of which only one car was involved in the accident. Cameron Mutual Insurance Co. v. Madden (Mo.), 533 S.W.2d 538.\n\n(1980) Employee eligible for payment under employer's uninsured motorist coverage was not entitled to \"stacking\" of the uninsured motorist coverage provided by the fleet policy for each vehicle insured by it. Linderer v. Royal Globe Insurance Co. (A.), 597 S.W.2d 656.\n\n(1980) Person injured in accident involving his employer's vehicle and an uninsured motorist not entitled to a \"stacking\" of the uninsured motorist coverage provided for each of employer's 1,420 vehicles, but was entitled to a \"stacking\" of such coverage on his own vehicles. Linderer v. Royal Globe Insurance Co. (A.), 597 S.W.2d 656.\n\n(1980) The term \"uninsured motor vehicle\" must be construed as referring to a vehicle being operated by a person whose legal responsibility for damages is not caused by any liability insurance provision. Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Hogan (Mo.), 605 S.W.2d 798.\n\n(1980) Use of term \"uninsured motorist\" in statute requiring inclusion of uninsured motorist insurance within automobile liability policies, is shorthand expression for \"owners and operators of uninsured motor vehicles\"; therefore, focus of statute is on uninsured vehicle and not whether owner or operator is \"uninsured motorist\" under circumstances of accident. Harrison v. MFA Mutual Insurance Co. (Mo.), 607 S.W.2d 137.\n\n(1980) Term \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as used in statutes providing that uninsured motorist insurance shall be included within automobile liability policy for protection of persons insured thereunder refers to vehicle whose operator or owner did not have in effect at time of accident an automobile liability policy with respect to motor vehicle involved in accident. Harrison v. MFA Mutual Insurance Co. (Mo.), 607 S.W.2d 137.\n\n(1980) Uninsured motorist statute has no application in cases where tort-feasor did have automobile liability policy which complied with requirements of Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law. Harrison v. MFA Mutual Insurance Co. (Mo.), 607 S.W.2d 137.\n\n(1980) Provision of uninsured motorist statute which states that \"uninsured motor vehicle\" includes an insured motor vehicle where liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to legal liability of its insured because of insolvency applies only where automobile insured under policy is hit by another vehicle and insurer of record vehicle becomes insolvent. Harrison v. MFA Mutual Insurance Co. (Mo.), 607 S.W.2d 137.\n\n(1980) Provision in statute requiring that uninsured motorist insurance be included within automobile liability policies allowing recovery under uninsured motorist provision when insurer of other vehicle involved is insolvent, by use of language \"subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage,\" recognizes insurer's right to define uninsured automobile. Harrison v. MFA Mutual Insurance Co. (Mo.), 607 S.W.2d 137.\n\n(1985) The public policy as declared in this section mandates that when an insured has two separate policies containing uninsured motorist clauses, effect shall be given to both coverages without reduction or limitation by policy provisions, and that both coverages are available to those insured thereby. Bergtholdt v. Farmers Ins. Co., Inc., (A.), 691 S.W.2d 357.\n\n(1986) The term \"uninsured motorist\" as used in section 379.203, RSMo, includes a motorist who is underinsured by the standards of section 303.030, RSMo. Cook v. Pedigo, 714 S.W.2d 949 (Mo. App. 1986).\n\n(1989) Insurer's prohibition of stacking by the policyholder's minor children is contrary to statute and invalid. Where plaintiff was a pedestrian and was injured by a hit and run driver, he was entitled to stack the uninsured motorist coverage on each of his father's autos. (Mo.App. E.D.) Husch by Husch v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 772 S.W.2d 692.\n\n(1993) Insurance company's limit of uninsured motorist coverage to injuries which were result of an accident is against public policy and is void because it attempts to narrow mandated uninsured motorist coverage required by section for every automobile liability policy. Thornburg v. Farmers Insurance Co., 859 S.W.2d 847 (Mo. App. W.D.).\n\n(1995) Where plaintiff was otherwise qualified as an insured for liability purposes, insurance policy exclusions limiting uninsured motorist protection in insurance policy limiting coverage to owned vehicles was void as against Missouri law and public policy. Bernardo v. Northland Insurance Co., 45 F.3d 272 (8th Cir.).\n\n(1996) Uninsured motorist coverage is not based on the vehicle in which the insured is operating or riding, but is personal coverage which follows the insured. Schmidt v. City of Gladstone, 913 S.W.2d 937 (Mo.App.W.D.).",

Documents required for insurance transactions or proof of coverage by electronic means permitted, when, requirements — inapplicability — withdrawal of consent, no additional fees for paper records — discounts. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Delivered by electronic means\", includes delivery to an electronic mail address at which a party has consented to receive notices or documents, or posting on an electronic network or site accessible via the internet, mobile application, computer, mobile device, tablet, or any other electronic device, together with a separate notice to a party directed to the electronic mail address at which the party has consented to receive notice of the posting;\n\n(2)\"Party\", any recipient of any notice or document required as part of an insurance transaction, including but not limited to an applicant, an insured or a policyholder.\n\n2. Subject to subsection 3 of this section, any notice to a party or any other document required under applicable law in an insurance transaction or that is to serve as evidence of insurance coverage may be delivered, stored, and presented by electronic means so long as it meets the requirements of sections 432.200 to 432.295. Delivery of a notice or document in accordance with this subsection shall be considered equivalent to any delivery method required under applicable law, including delivery by first class mail, first class mail postage prepaid, certified mail, or certificate of mailing.\n\n3. A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means by an insurer to a party under this section if:\n\n(1) The party has affirmatively consented to that method of delivery and has not withdrawn the consent;\n\n(2) The party, before giving consent, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement informing the party of:\n\n(a) Any right or option to have the notice or document provided in paper or another nonelectronic form at no additional cost;\n\n(b) The right of the party to withdraw consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means;\n\n(c) Whether the party's consent applies only to the particular transaction as to which the notice or document must be given or to identified categories of notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means during the course of the parties' relationship;\n\n(d) The means, after consent is given, by which a party may obtain a paper copy of a notice or document delivered by electronic means at no additional cost; and\n\n(e) The procedure a party must follow to withdraw consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means and to update information needed to contact the party electronically;\n\n(3) The party, before giving consent, is provided with a statement of the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means and consents electronically, and confirms consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the party can access information in the electronic form that will be used for notices or documents delivered by electronic means as to which the party has given consent; and\n\n(4) After consent of the party is given, the insurer, in the event a change in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain a notice or document delivered in electronic means creates a material risk that the party will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice or document to which the consent applies:\n\n(a) Provides the party with a statement of the revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means and of the right of the party to withdraw consent pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) of this subsection; and\n\n(b) Complies with subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if a policy of insurance is purchased directly through an insurer's website, portal, or application, and is initially delivered by electronic means, a party's consent to have all future notices and documents related to the policy, or claims thereunder, delivered by electronic means shall be presumed. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the right of a party under this section to withdraw its consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means.\n\n5. This section does not affect requirements relating to content or timing of any notice or document required under applicable law. If any provision of applicable law requiring a notice or document to be provided to a party expressly requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt of the notice or document, the notice or document may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used provides for verification or acknowledgment of receipt. Absent verification or acknowledgment of receipt of the initial notice or document on the part of the party, the insurer shall send two subsequent notices or documents at intervals of five business days. The legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of any contract or policy of insurance executed by a party may not be made contingent upon obtaining electronic consent or confirmation of consent of the party in accordance with subdivision (3) of subsection 3 of this section.\n\n6. A withdrawal of consent by a party does not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a notice or document delivered by electronic means to the party before the withdrawal of consent is effective. A withdrawal of consent by a party is effective within thirty days after receipt of the withdrawal by the insurer. Failure by an insurer to comply with subdivision (4) of subsection 3 of this section may be treated, at the election of the party, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this section.\n\n7. This section does not apply to a notice or document delivered by an insurer in an electronic form before August 28, 2013, to a party who, before that date, has consented to receive notices or documents in an electronic form otherwise allowed by law. If the consent of a party to receive certain notices or documents in an electronic form is on file with an insurer before August 28, 2013, and pursuant to this section, an insurer intends to deliver additional notices or documents to such party in an electronic form, then prior to delivering such additional notices or documents electronically, the insurer shall notify the party of:\n\n(1) The notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means under this section that were not previously delivered electronically; and\n\n(2) The party's right to withdraw consent to have notices or documents delivered by electronic means.\n\n8. A party who does not consent to delivery of notices or documents under subsection 3 of this section, or who withdraws their consent, shall not be subject to any additional fees or costs for having notices or documents provided or made available to them in paper or another nonelectronic form.\n\n9. If any provision of applicable law requires a signature or notice or document to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by the provision, is attached to or logically associated with the signature, notice, or document.\n\n10. This section may not be construed to modify, limit, or supercede the provisions of sections 354.442, 376.1450, or 432.200 to 432.295. The provisions of this section shall apply to notices and documents issued by insurers organized under this chapter or chapter 380 and to notices and documents relating to life insurance products issued by insurers organized under chapter 376.\n\n11.

The director shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this section and impose any authorized penalty or remedy against any person who violates this section.\n\n16.

No insurer shall cancel or refuse to write or refuse to renew a policy of automobile insurance on any person with at least two years' driving experience solely because of the age, residence, race, sex, color, creed, national origin, ancestry or lawful occupation, including the military service, of anyone who is or seeks to become insured or solely because another insurer has refused to write a policy, or has cancelled or has refused to renew an existing policy in which that person was the named insured, nor shall any insurance company or its agent or representative require any applicant, policyholder or operator to divulge in a written application or otherwise whether any insurer has cancelled or refused to renew or issue to the applicant, policyholder or operator a policy of automobile insurance; provided, however, nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to require any insurer which under its plan of operation insures a particular class of persons or customarily operates in a specific geographical territory to insure any person outside of the class or operate outside the geographical territory.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 354 § 3, A.L. 1974 S.B. 572)\n\n(1977) This section does not prohibit a cancellation whose effective date would occur more than sixty-one days past the issuance of the policy so long as the cancellation was initiated during the initial sixty-day period.

Notice shall be sent by United States Postal Service certificate of mailing, first class mail using Intelligent Mail barcode (IMb), or another mail tracking method used, approved, or accepted by the United States Postal Service. Where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium at least ten days' notice of cancellation shall be given and such notice shall contain the following notice or substantially similar in bold conspicuous type: \"THIS POLICY IS CANCELLED EFFECTIVE AT THE DATE AND TIME INDICATED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS IS THE FINAL NOTICE OF CANCELLATION WE WILL SEND PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND TIME OF CANCELLATION INDICATED IN THIS NOTICE.\".

Issuance of a notice of cancellation under subsection 1 of this section constitutes a present and unequivocal act of cancellation of the policy.\n\n3. An insurer may reinstate a policy cancelled under subsection 1 of this section at any time after the notice of cancellation is issued if the reason for the cancellation is remedied. An insurer may send communications to the insured, including but not limited to billing notices for past-due premium, offers to reinstate the policy if past-due premium is paid, notices confirming cancellation of the policy, or billing notices for payment of earned but unpaid premium. The fact that a policy may be so reinstated or any such communication may be made does not invalidate or void any cancellation effectuated under subsection 1 of this section or defeat the present and unequivocal nature of acts of cancellation as described under subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4.

Any request for electronic delivery of renewal notices shall be designated on the application form signed by the applicant, made in writing by the policyholder, or made in accordance with sections 432.200 to 432.295. The insurer shall comply with any subsequent request by a policyholder to rescind authorization for electronic delivery and to elect to receive renewal notices by first class mail. Any delivery of a renewal notice by electronic means shall not constitute notice of cancellation of a policy even if such notice is included with the renewal notice.\n\n(2) An insurer shall provide a written notice of a reduction in coverage to the named insured no less than fifteen days prior to the effective date of the proposed reduction in coverage or shall send such notice of reduction in coverage with the written notice of renewal described in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Written notice of a reduction in coverage may be satisfied by providing the named insured a copy of or access to the updated policy form or the policy form language that will be changed. The notice shall be sent by first class mail or may be sent electronically if agreed to or requested by the policyholder.\n\n5.

Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\n\n(3) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expense provisions are applicable and shall accurately reflect the expenses of insurers or groups of insurers.\n\n(4) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.

Every insurer shall file with the director, except as to commercial property or commercial casualty insurance as provided in subsection 6 of this section, every manual of classifications, rules, underwriting rules and rates, every rating plan and every modification of the foregoing which it uses and the policies and forms to which such rates are applied. Any insurer may satisfy its obligation to make any such filings by becoming a member of, or a subscriber to, a licensed rating organization which makes such filings and by authorizing the director to accept such filings on its behalf, provided that nothing contained in section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361 shall be construed as requiring any insurer to become a member of or a subscriber to any rating organization or as requiring any member or subscriber to authorize the director to accept such filings on its behalf. Filing with the director by such insurer or licensed rating organization within ten days after such manuals, rating plans or modifications thereof or policies or forms are effective shall be sufficient compliance with this section.\n\n2. Except as to commercial property or commercial casualty insurance as provided in subsection 6 of this section, no insurer shall make or issue a policy or contract except pursuant to filings which are in effect for that insurer or pursuant to section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361.

Upon the written application of the insured, stating his or her reasons therefor, filed with the insurer, a rate in excess of that provided by a filing otherwise applicable may be used on any specific risk.\n\n4. Every insurer which is a member of or a subscriber to a rating organization shall be deemed to have authorized the director to accept on its behalf all filings made by the rating organization which are within the scope of its membership or subscribership, provided:\n\n(1) That any subscriber may withdraw or terminate such authorization, either generally or for individual filings, by written notice to the director and to the rating organization and may then make its own independent filings for any kinds of insurance, or subdivisions, or classes of risks, or parts or combinations of any of the foregoing, with respect to which it has withdrawn or terminated such authorization, or may request the rating organization, within its discretion, to make any such filing on an agency basis solely on behalf of the requesting subscriber; and\n\n(2) That any member may proceed in the same manner as a subscriber unless the rating organization shall have adopted a rule, with the approval of the director:\n\n(a) Requiring a member, before making an independent filing, first to request the rating organization to make such filing on its behalf and requiring the rating organization, within thirty days after receipt of such request, either:\n\na. To make such filing as a rating organization filing;\n\nb. To make such filing on an agency basis solely on behalf of the requesting member; or\n\nc. To decline the request of such member; and\n\n(b) Excluding from membership any insurer which elects to make any filing wholly independently of the rating organization.\n\n5. Any change in a filing made pursuant to this section during the first six months of the date such filing becomes effective shall be approved or disapproved by the director within ten days following the director's receipt of notice of such proposed change.\n\n6. Commercial property and commercial casualty requirements differ as follows:\n\n(1) Commercial property and commercial casualty insurance rates, rate plans, modifications, and manuals of classifications, except as specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be filed with the director for informational purposes only within ten days of use. Such rates are not to be reviewed or approved by the department of commerce and insurance as a condition of their use. Nothing in this subsection shall require the filing of individual rates where the original manuals, rates and rules for the insurance plan or program to which such individual policies conform have already been filed with the director;\n\n(2) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (4) of this subsection, commercial property and casualty underwriting rules or guidelines, rates, rate plans, modifications, and manuals of classification are exempt from filing requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter, whether the insurance coverage is endorsed to or otherwise made part of another type of insurance or sold as a stand-alone policy;\n\n(3) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (4) of this subsection, commercial property and casualty insurance policy forms are exempt from filing requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter when the aggregate total annual commercial insurance premiums for all property and casualty insurance purchased by a commercial policyholder, excluding premiums for the types of insurance specified in subdivision (4) of this subsection, are equal to or exceed one hundred thousand dollars and the commercial policyholder employs a full-time risk manager or has retained a licensed insurance producer to negotiate on its behalf;\n\n(4) The filing exemptions in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection shall not apply to:\n\n(a) Workers' compensation;\n\n(b) Medical malpractice liability;\n\n(c) Farm property and liability;\n\n(d) Any coverage issued by an assigned risk or residual market plan pursuant to section 303.200; and\n\n(e) Any specific policy or bond required by the division of workers' compensation of a self-insured employer or group trust, their trustees, or entities providing services to self-insured employers or group trusts;\n\n(5) All policies exempt from filing pursuant to subdivision*(2) or (3) of this subsection shall include, at the time of policy issuance, a notice advising the policyholder that the policy may include rates or forms exempt from filing with the department. Such notice shall state that this policy may include rates and forms which may not be filed with the Missouri department of commerce and insurance;\n\n(6) If an insurer will only renew a commercial casualty or commercial property insurance policy with an increase in premium of twenty-five percent or more, a premium alteration requiring notification notice must be mailed or delivered by the insurer at least sixty days prior to the expiration date of the policy, except in the case of an umbrella or excess policy the coverage of which is contingent on the coverage of an underlying policy of commercial property or casualty insurance, in which case notice of an increase in premium of twenty-five percent or more shall be mailed or delivered at least thirty days prior to the expiration date of the policy. Such notice shall be mailed or delivered to the agent of record and to the named insured at the address shown in the policy. If the insurer fails to meet this notice requirement, the insured shall have the option of continuing the policy for the remainder of the notice period plus an additional thirty days at the premium rate of the existing policy or contract. This provision does not apply if the insurer has offered to renew a policy without such an increase in premium or if the insured fails to pay a premium due or any advance premium required by the insurer for renewal. For purposes of this section,\"premium alteration requiring notification\"means an annual increase in premium of twenty-five percent or more, exclusive of premium increases due to a change in the operations of the insured which increases either the hazard insured against or the individual loss characteristics, or due to a change in the magnitude of the exposure basis, including, without limitation, increases in payroll or sales. For commercial multiperil policies, no premium alteration requiring notification shall be required unless the increase in premium for all of a policyholder's policies taken together amounts to a twenty-five percent or more annual increase in premium;\n\n(7) Commercial property and commercial casualty policy forms, except as specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection, shall be filed with the director within ten days of use as provided pursuant to subsection 1 of this section. However, if after review, it is determined that corrective action must be taken to modify the filed forms, the director shall impose such corrective action on a prospective basis for new policies. All policies previously issued which are of a type that is subject to such corrective action shall be deemed to have been modified to conform to such corrective action retroactive to their inception date;\n\n(8) An insurer renewing a policy issued with policy forms not filed with the director pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection shall provide written notice to the first named insured and producer of record, if any, at least ten days prior to the current policy's expiration date if, after renewal, there will be a material restriction or reduction in coverage not specifically requested by the insured, required by law or based on the altered nature or extent of the risk insured. The notice may be in a printed or electronic form and shall explain what coverage will be reduced or eliminated or what condition will be restricted. It shall be a rebuttable presumption that all insureds received the notice if it was sent by email or first class mail to the first named insured's last known email address or mailing address contained in the policy. If the insurer has not so notified the policyholder, the policyholder may elect to cancel the renewal policy within thirty days of delivery of the renewal policy and the earned premium for the time the renewal policy was in force shall be calculated pro rata at the lower of the current or previous year's rate. If the insured accepts the renewal, any premium change or alteration of coverage, terms or conditions shall be effective immediately upon the expiration of the prior policy. Nothing in this subdivision shall restrict the right of the parties to an insurance contract to amend an insurance policy if requested by the insured without the requirement for any notice;\n\n(9) For purposes of this section,\"commercial casualty\"means \"commercial casualty insurance\" as defined in section 379.882. For purposes of this section,\"commercial property\"means property insurance, which is for business and professional interests, whether for profit, nonprofit or public in nature which is not for personal, family or household purposes, and shall include commercial inland marine insurance, but does not include title insurance;\n\n(10) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the director's authority over excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates or affect the application of any laws governing unfair trade practices, unfair claims practices, or the content of policy forms;\n\n(11) The commercial casualty and commercial property insurance filing requirement exemptions included in this section shall apply to all property and casualty insurance policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2019.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 547 § 4, A.L. 1999 S.B. 386, A.L. 2001 S.B. 186, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1468, A.L. 2018 S.B. 594)\n\n*Word \"subdivisions\" appears in original rolls.",

Such a rating organization shall make application to the director for license as a rating organization for such kinds of insurance, or subdivisions, or classes or risk, or parts or combinations of any of the foregoing as are specified in its application and shall file therewith:\n\n(1) A copy of its constitution, its articles of agreement or association or its certificate of incorporation, and of its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business;\n\n(2) A list of its members and subscribers;\n\n(3) The name and address of a resident of this state upon whom notices or orders of the director or process affecting such rating organization may be served;\n\n(4) A statement of its qualifications as a rating organization; and\n\n(5) An agreement that the director may examine such rating organization in accordance with the provisions of section 379.343.\n\n3. If the director finds that the applicant is competent, trustworthy, and otherwise qualified to act as a rating organization, and that its constitution, articles of agreement or association or certificate of incorporation, and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, he shall issue a license specifying the kinds of insurance, or subdivisions, or classes or risk, or parts or combinations of any of the foregoing for which the applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization. Every such application shall be granted or denied in whole or in part by the director within sixty days of the date of its filing with him. Licenses issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for three years unless sooner suspended or revoked by the director. The fee for the license is twenty-five dollars. Licenses issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or revoked by the director, after hearing upon notice, in the event the rating organization ceases to meet the requirements of this subsection. Every rating organization shall notify the director promptly of every change in:\n\n(1) Its constitution, its articles of agreement or association, or its certificate of incorporation, and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business;\n\n(2) Its list of members and subscribers; and,\n\n(3) The name and address of the resident of this state designated by it upon whom notices or orders of the director or process affecting such rating organization may be served.\n\n4. Subject to rules and regulations which have been approved by the director as reasonable, each rating organization shall permit any insurer, not a member, to be a subscriber to its services for any one or more of the kinds of insurance, subdivisions, or classes or risk or parts or combinations of any of the foregoing for which it is authorized to act as an organization. Notice of proposed changes in such rules and regulations shall be given to subscribers. Each rating organization shall furnish its services without discrimination to its members and subscribers. The reasonableness of any rule or regulation in its application to subscribers, or the refusal of any rating organization to admit an insurer as a subscriber, shall, at the request of any subscriber or any such insurer, be reviewed by the director at a hearing held upon at least ten days' written notice to such rating organization and to such subscriber or insurer. If the director finds that such rule or regulation is unreasonable in its application to subscribers, he shall order that such rule or regulation shall not be applicable to subscribers. If the rating organization fails to grant or reject an insurer's application for subscribership within thirty days after it was made, the insurer may request a review by the director as if the application had been rejected. If the director finds that the insurer has been refused admittance to the rating organization as a subscriber without justification, he shall order the rating organization to admit the insurer as a subscriber. If he finds that the action of the rating organization was justified, he shall make an order affirming its action.\n\n5. No rating organization shall adopt any rule the effect of which would be to prohibit or regulate the payment of dividends or savings allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders or members.\n\n6. Cooperation among rating organizations or among rating organizations and insurers in ratemaking or in other matters within the scope of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361 is hereby authorized, provided the filings resulting from such cooperation are subject to all the provisions of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361 which are applicable to filings generally. The director may review such cooperative activities and practices and if, after a hearing, he finds that any such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable, or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361, he may issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361, and requiring the discontinuance of such activity or practice.\n\n7. Any rating organization may subscribe for or purchase actuarial, technical or other services, and such services shall be available to all members and subscribers without discrimination.\n\n8. A\"member of a rating organization\"means an insurer entitled to participate in its management and electing to exercise its right to so participate.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 547 § 5)",

If the director believes that a person has engaged, is engaging in, or has taken a substantial step toward engaging in an act, practice or course of business constituting a violation of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361 or a rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto, or that a person has materially aided or is materially aiding an act, practice, omission, or course of business constituting a violation of section 379.017 and sections 379.316 to 379.361 or a rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto, the director may maintain a civil action for relief authorized under section 374.048. A violation of any of these sections is a level two violation under section 374.049. The practice of using a rate not in effect under section 379.321, if caused by a single act or omission by the insurer or filing organization, is a level two violation under section 374.049. Each act as part of a rating violation does not constitute a separate violation under section 374.049.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 547 § 20, A.L. 2007 S.B. 66)",

Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.

Carriers to offer all health plans in market — health benefit plans, requirements — exclusion of coverage for certain employees. —1. (1) Every small employer carrier shall, as a condition of transacting business in this state with small employers, actively offer to small employers all health benefit plans it actively markets to small employers in this state, except for plans developed for health benefit trust funds.\n\n(2) (a) A small employer carrier shall issue a health benefit plan to any eligible small employer that applies for either such plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other reasonable provisions of the health benefit plan not inconsistent with sections 379.930 to 379.952.\n\n(b) For health benefit plans purchased on or before March 23, 2010, in the case of a small employer carrier that establishes more than one class of business pursuant to section 379.934, the small employer carrier shall maintain and issue to eligible small employers all health benefit plans in each class of business so established. A small employer carrier may apply reasonable criteria in determining whether to accept a small employer into a class of business, provided that:\n\na. The criteria are not intended to discourage or prevent acceptance of small employers applying for a health benefit plan;\n\nb. The criteria are not related to the health status or claim experience of the small employer;\n\nc. The criteria are applied consistently to all small employers applying for coverage in the class of business; and\n\nd. The small employer carrier provides for the acceptance of all eligible small employers into one or more classes of business.\n\n­­The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a class of business into which the small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new small employers.\n\n2. Health benefit plans purchased on or before March 23, 2010, covering small employers shall comply with the following provisions:\n\n(1) A health benefit plan shall comply with the provisions of sections 376.450 and 376.451.\n\n(2) (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subdivision, requirements used by a small employer carrier in determining whether to provide coverage to a small employer, including requirements for minimum participation of eligible employees and minimum employer contributions, shall be applied uniformly among all small employers with the same number of eligible employees applying for coverage or receiving coverage from the small employer carrier.\n\n(b) A small employer carrier shall not require a minimum participation level greater than:\n\na. One hundred percent of eligible employees working for groups of three or less employees; and\n\nb. Seventy-five percent of eligible employees working for groups with more than three employees.\n\n(c) In applying minimum participation requirements with respect to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall not consider employees or dependents who have qualifying existing coverage in determining whether the applicable percentage of participation is met.\n\n(d) A small employer carrier shall not increase any requirement for minimum employee participation or modify any requirement for minimum employer contribution applicable to a small employer at any time after the small employer has been accepted for coverage.\n\n(3) (a) If a small employer carrier offers coverage to a small employer, the small employer carrier shall offer coverage to all of the eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents who apply for enrollment during the period in which the employee first becomes eligible to enroll under the terms of the plan. A small employer carrier shall not offer coverage to only certain individuals or dependents in a small employer group or to only part of the group.\n\n(b) A small employer carrier shall not modify a health benefit plan with respect to a small employer or any eligible employee or dependent through riders, endorsements or otherwise, to restrict or exclude coverage for certain diseases or medical conditions otherwise covered by the health benefit plan.\n\n(c) An eligible employee may choose to retain their individually underwritten health benefit plan at the time such eligible employee is entitled to enroll in a small employer health benefit plan. If the eligible employee retains their individually underwritten health benefit plan, a small employer may provide a defined contribution through the establishment of a cafeteria 125 plan under section 379.953*. Small employers shall establish an equal amount of defined contribution for all plans. If an eligible employee retains their individually underwritten health benefit plan under this subdivision, the provisions of sections 379.930 to 379.952 shall not apply to the individually underwritten health benefit plan.\n\n3. (1) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, a small employer carrier shall not be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection 1 of this section in the case of the following:\n\n(a) To a small employer, where the small employer is not physically located in the carrier's established geographic service area;\n\n(b) To an employee, when the employee does not live, work or reside within the carrier's established geographic service area; or\n\n(c) Within an area where the small employer carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director, that it will not have the capacity within its established geographic service area to deliver service adequately to the members of such groups because of its obligations to existing group policyholders and enrollees.\n\n(2) A small employer carrier that cannot offer coverage pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision (1) of this subsection may not offer coverage in the applicable area to new cases of employer groups with more than fifty eligible employees or to any small employer groups until the later of one hundred eighty days following each such refusal or the date on which the carrier notifies the director that it has regained capacity to deliver services to small employer groups.\n\n(3) A small employer carrier shall apply the provisions of this subsection uniformly to all small employers without regard to the claims experience of a small employer and its employees and their dependents or any health status-related factor relating to such employees and their dependents.\n\n4. A small employer carrier shall not be required to provide coverage to small employers pursuant to subsection 1 of this section for any period of time for which the director determines that requiring the acceptance of small employers in accordance with the provisions of subsection 1 of this section would place the small employer carrier in a financially impaired condition, and the small employer is applying this subsection uniformly to all small employers in the small group market in this state consistent with applicable state law and without regard to the claims experience of a small employer and its employees and their dependents or any health status-related factor relating to such employees and their dependents.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 796 §§ 6, B, A.L. 2007 H.B. 818, A.L. 2016 S.B. 865 & 866)\n\n*Section 379.953 does not exist.",

Each participant contract shall state that under section 379.1324 no benefit shall be paid to the participant or any other party from any state guaranty fund based on a claim against the assets of the participant's protected cell in which such assets are insufficient to satisfy the claim;\n\n(12) At the discretion of the director, the business written by a sponsored captive, with respect to each cell, shall be:\n\n(a) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any state;\n\n(b) Reinsured by reinsurer authorized or approved by the state of Missouri; or\n\n(c) Secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or other arrangement that is acceptable to the director.­­The director may require the sponsored captive to increase the funding of any security arrangement established under this subdivision. If the form of security is a letter of credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved by the director. A trust maintained under this subdivision shall be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the director;\n\n­­The director may require the sponsored captive to increase the funding of any security arrangement established under this subdivision.

A trust maintained under this subdivision shall be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the director;\n\n(13) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 375.1150 to 375.1246 or other laws of this state, and in addition to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section, in the event of an insolvency of a sponsored captive insurance company where the director determines that one or more protected cells remain solvent, the director may separate such cells from the sponsored captive insurance company, and may allow, on application of the sponsor, for the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing sponsored captive insurance companies with a sponsor or sponsors, or one or more other captive insurance companies, under such plan or plans of operation as the director deems acceptable.\n\n5. A protected cell of a sponsored captive insurance company may be formed as an incorporated protected cell, as described in subdivision (1) of subsection 4 of this section. The articles of incorporation or articles of organization of an incorporated protected cell shall refer to the sponsored captive insurance company for which it is a protected cell and shall state that the protected cell is incorporated or organized for the limited purposes authorized by the sponsored captive insurance company's license. A copy of the prior written approval of the director to add the incorporated protected cell, required by subdivision (11) of subsection 4 of this section, shall be attached to and filed with the articles of incorporation or articles of organization. It is the intent of the general assembly under this subsection to provide sponsored captive insurance companies with the option to establish one or more protected cells as a separate corporation formed under chapter 351 or limited liability company formed under chapter 347. This section shall not be construed to limit any rights or protections applicable to protected cells not established as corporations or limited liability companies.\n\n6. A sponsor of a sponsored captive insurance company may be any person approved by the director in the exercise of the director's discretion, based on a determination that the approval of such person as sponsor is consistent with the purposes of sections 379.1300 to 379.1351. In evaluating the qualifications of a proposed sponsor, the director shall consider the type and structure of the proposed sponsor entity, its experience in financial operations, financial stability, and strength of business reputation and such other facts deemed relevant by the director. A risk retention group shall not be either a sponsor or a participant of a sponsored captive insurance company.\n\n7. Associations, corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, trusts, and other business entities may be participants in any sponsored captive insurance company formed or licensed under this chapter. A sponsor may be a participant in a sponsored captive insurance company. A participant need not be a shareholder of the sponsored captive insurance company or an affiliate thereof. A participant shall insure only its own risks through a sponsored captive insurance company.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 4 of this section, the assets of two or more protected cells may be combined for purposes of investment and such combination shall not be construed as defeating the segregation of such assets for accounting or other purposes. Sponsored captive insurance companies shall comply with the investment requirements contained in sections 379.080 and 379.082, as applicable; provided, however, that compliance with such investment requirements shall be waived for sponsored captive insurance companies to the extent that credit for reinsurance ceded to reinsurers is allowed under section 379.1320 or to the extent otherwise deemed reasonable and appropriate by the director. The director shall exercise his or her discretion in approving the accounting standards in use by the company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the director may approve the use of alternative reliable methods of valuation and rating.\n\n9. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of sections 375.1150 to 375.1246 shall apply in full to a sponsored captive insurance company. Upon any order of supervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation of a sponsored captive insurance company, the receiver shall manage the assets and liabilities of the sponsored captive insurance company under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 375.1150 to 375.1246:\n\n(1) The assets of a protected cell shall not be used to pay any expense or claims other than those attributable to such protected cell; and\n\n(2) A sponsored captive insurance company's capital and surplus shall at all times be available to pay any expenses of or claims against the sponsored captive insurance company.\n\n(L. 2013 S.B. 287)",

Except as provided in subsection 2 of this section, a peer-to-peer car-sharing program shall assume liability of a shared vehicle owner for:\n\n(1) Bodily injury or property damage to third parties;\n\n(2) Uninsured and underinsured motorist losses; or\n\n(3) To the extent personal injury protection coverage is required by law, personal injury protection losses;\n\n­­during the car-sharing period in an amount stated in the peer-to-peer car-sharing program agreement, which amount shall not be less than the amount required under chapter 303.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the definition of \"car-sharing termination time\" in section 379.1910, the assumption of liability under subsection 1 of this section shall not apply to any shared vehicle owner when:\n\n(1) A shared vehicle owner makes an intentional or fraudulent material misrepresentation or omission to the peer-to-peer car-sharing program before the car-sharing period in which the loss occurred; or\n\n(2) Acting in concert with a shared vehicle driver who fails to return the shared vehicle in accordance with the terms of the car-sharing program agreement.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the definition of \"car-sharing termination time\" in section 379.1910, the assumption of liability under subsection 1 of this section shall apply to bodily injury losses, property damage losses, uninsured and underinsured motorist losses, or to the extent personal injury protection coverage is required by law, personal injury protection losses, by damaged third parties as required by chapter 303.\n\n4. A peer-to-peer car-sharing program shall ensure that, during each car-sharing period, the shared vehicle owner and the shared vehicle driver are insured under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy that provides insurance coverage in amounts no less than the minimum amounts set forth in chapter 303, and that:\n\n(1) Recognizes that the shared vehicle insured under the policy is made available and used through a peer-to-peer car-sharing program; or\n\n(2) Does not exclude use of a shared vehicle by a shared vehicle driver.\n\n5. The insurance described under subsection 4 of this section may be satisfied by motor vehicle liability insurance maintained by:\n\n(1) A shared vehicle owner;\n\n(2) A shared vehicle driver;\n\n(3) A peer-to-peer car-sharing program; or\n\n(4) A shared vehicle owner, a shared vehicle driver, and a peer-to-peer car-sharing program.\n\n6. The insurance described in subsection 5 of this section that is satisfying the insurance requirement of subsection 4 of this section shall be primary during each car-sharing period. If a claim occurs in another state with minimum financial responsibility limits higher than the minimum financial responsibility requirements in chapter 303 during the car-sharing period, the coverage maintained under subsection 5 of this section shall satisfy the difference in minimum coverage amounts up to the applicable policy limits.\n\n7. The insurer, insurers, or peer-to-peer car-sharing program providing coverage under subsection 4 or 5 of this section shall assume primary liability for a claim when:\n\n(1) A dispute exists as to who was in control of the shared vehicle at the time of the loss and the peer-to-peer car-sharing program does not have available, did not retain, or fails to provide the information required by section 379.1930; or\n\n(2) A dispute exists as to whether the shared vehicle was returned to the alternatively agreed-upon location as required under paragraph (b) of subdivision (5) of section 379.1910.\n\n8. If insurance maintained by a shared vehicle owner or shared vehicle driver in accordance with subsection 5 of this section has lapsed or does not provide the required coverage, insurance maintained by a peer-to-peer car-sharing program shall provide the coverage required by subsection 4 of this section, beginning with the first dollar of a claim, and have the duty to defend such claim except under circumstances as set forth in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n9. Coverage under an automobile insurance policy maintained by the peer-to-peer car-sharing program shall not be dependent on another automobile insurer first denying a claim nor shall another automobile insurance policy be required to first deny a claim.\n\n10. Nothing in this section:\n\n(1) Limits the liability of the peer-to-peer car-sharing program for any act or omission of the peer-to-peer car-sharing program itself that results in injury to any person as a result of the use of a shared vehicle through a peer-to-peer car-sharing program; or\n\n(2) Limits the ability of the peer-to-peer car-sharing program to, by contract, seek indemnification from the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle driver for economic loss sustained by the peer-to-peer car-sharing program resulting from a breach of the terms and conditions of the car-sharing program agreement.\n\n(L. 2025 H.B. 974, et al.)\n\nEffective 1-01-26",
