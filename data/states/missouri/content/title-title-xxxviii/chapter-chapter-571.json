An application for a concealed carry permit shall be made to the sheriff of the county or any city not within a county in which the applicant resides. An application shall be filed in writing, signed under oath and under the penalties of perjury, and shall state whether the applicant complies with each of the requirements specified in subsection 2 of this section. In addition to the completed application, the applicant for a concealed carry permit must also submit the following:\n\n(1) A photocopy of a firearms safety training certificate of completion or other evidence of completion of a firearms safety training course that meets the standards established in subsection 1 or 2 of section 571.111; and\n\n(2) A nonrefundable permit fee as provided by subsection 11 or 12 of this section.\n\n5. (1) Before an application for a concealed carry permit is approved, the sheriff shall make only such inquiries as he or she deems necessary into the accuracy of the statements made in the application. The sheriff may require that the applicant display a Missouri driver's license or nondriver's license or military identification and orders showing the person being stationed in Missouri. In order to determine the applicant's suitability for a concealed carry permit, the applicant shall be fingerprinted. No other biometric data shall be collected from the applicant. The sheriff shall conduct an inquiry of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System within three working days after submission of the properly completed application for a concealed carry permit. If no disqualifying record is identified by these checks at the state level, the fingerprints shall be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. Upon receipt of the completed report from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and the response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation national criminal history record check, the sheriff shall examine the results and, if no disqualifying information is identified, shall issue a concealed carry permit within three working days.\n\n(2) In the event the report from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and the response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation national criminal history record check prescribed by subdivision (1) of this subsection are not completed within forty-five calendar days and no disqualifying information concerning the applicant has otherwise come to the sheriff's attention, the sheriff shall issue a provisional permit, clearly designated on the certificate as such, which the applicant shall sign in the presence of the sheriff or the sheriff's designee. This permit, when carried with a valid Missouri driver's or nondriver's license or a valid military identification, shall permit the applicant to exercise the same rights in accordance with the same conditions as pertain to a concealed carry permit issued under this section, provided that it shall not serve as an alternative to an national instant criminal background check required by 18 U.S.C. Section 922(t). The provisional permit shall remain valid until such time as the sheriff either issues or denies the certificate of qualification under subsection 6 or 7 of this section. The sheriff shall revoke a provisional permit issued under this subsection within twenty-four hours of receipt of any report that identifies a disqualifying record, and shall notify the concealed carry permit system established under subsection 5 of section 650.350. The revocation of a provisional permit issued under this section shall be proscribed in a manner consistent to the denial and review of an application under subsection 6 of this section.\n\n6. The sheriff may refuse to approve an application for a concealed carry permit if he or she determines that any of the requirements specified in subsection 2 of this section have not been met, or if he or she has a substantial and demonstrable reason to believe that the applicant has rendered a false statement regarding any of the provisions of sections 571.101 to 571.121. If the applicant is found to be ineligible, the sheriff is required to deny the application, and notify the applicant in writing, stating the grounds for denial and informing the applicant of the right to submit, within thirty days, any additional documentation relating to the grounds of the denial. Upon receiving any additional documentation, the sheriff shall reconsider his or her decision and inform the applicant within thirty days of the result of the reconsideration. The applicant shall further be informed in writing of the right to appeal the denial pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114. After two additional reviews and denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the application shall appeal the denial pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114.\n\n7. If the application is approved, the sheriff shall issue a concealed carry permit to the applicant within a period not to exceed three working days after his or her approval of the application. The applicant shall sign the concealed carry permit in the presence of the sheriff or his or her designee.\n\n8. The concealed carry permit shall specify only the following information:\n\n(1) Name, address, date of birth, gender, height, weight, color of hair, color of eyes, and signature of the permit holder;\n\n(2) The signature of the sheriff issuing the permit;\n\n(3) The date of issuance; and\n\n(4) The expiration date.\n\n­­The permit shall be no larger than two and one-eighth inches wide by three and three-eighths inches long and shall be of a uniform style prescribed by the department of public safety. The permit shall also be assigned a concealed carry permit system county code and shall be stored in sequential number.\n\n9. (1) The sheriff shall keep a record of all applications for a concealed carry permit or a provisional permit and his or her action thereon. Any record of an application that is incomplete or denied for any reason shall be kept for a period not to exceed one year. Any record of an application that was approved shall be kept for a period of one year after the expiration and nonrenewal of the permit.\n\n(2) The sheriff shall report the issuance of a concealed carry permit or provisional permit to the concealed carry permit system. All information on any such permit that is protected information on any driver's or nondriver's license shall have the same personal protection for purposes of sections 571.101 to 571.121. An applicant's status as a holder of a concealed carry permit, provisional permit, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall not be public information and shall be considered personal protected information. Information retained in the concealed carry permit system under this subsection shall not be distributed to any federal, state, or private entities and shall only be made available for a single entry query of an individual in the event the individual is a subject of interest in an active criminal investigation or is arrested for a crime. A sheriff may access the concealed carry permit system for administrative purposes to issue a permit, verify the accuracy of permit holder information, change the name or address of a permit holder, suspend or revoke a permit, cancel an expired permit, or cancel a permit upon receipt of a certified death certificate for the permit holder. Any person who violates the provisions of this subdivision by disclosing protected information shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n10. Information regarding any holder of a concealed carry permit, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, is a closed record. No bulk download or batch data shall be distributed to any federal, state, or private entity, except to MoSMART or a designee thereof. Any state agency that has retained any documents or records, including fingerprint records provided by an applicant for a concealed carry endorsement prior to August 28, 2013, shall destroy such documents or records, upon successful issuance of a permit.\n\n11. For processing an application for a concealed carry permit pursuant to sections 571.101 to 571.121, the sheriff in each county shall charge a nonrefundable fee not to exceed one hundred dollars which shall be paid to the treasury of the county to the credit of the sheriff's revolving fund. This fee shall include the cost to reimburse the Missouri state highway patrol for the costs of fingerprinting and criminal background checks. An additional fee shall be added to each credit card, debit card, or other electronic transaction equal to the charge paid by the state or the applicant for the use of the credit card, debit card, or other electronic payment method by the applicant.\n\n12. For processing a renewal for a concealed carry permit pursuant to sections 571.101 to 571.121, the sheriff in each county shall charge a nonrefundable fee not to exceed fifty dollars which shall be paid to the treasury of the county to the credit of the sheriff's revolving fund.\n\n13. For the purposes of sections 571.101 to 571.121, the term\"sheriff\"shall include the sheriff of any county or city not within a county or his or her designee and in counties of the first classification the sheriff may designate the chief of police of any city, town, or municipality within such county.\n\n14. For the purposes of this chapter,\"concealed carry permit\"shall include any concealed carry endorsement issued by the department of revenue before January 1, 2014, and any concealed carry document issued by any sheriff or under the authority of any sheriff after December 31, 2013.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 349, et al., § 571.094, subsecs. 1 to 12, A.L. 2008 H.B. 2034, A.L. 2011 H.B. 294, et al., A.L. 2012 H.B. 1647, A.L. 2013 S.B. 75, A.L. 2014 S.B. 656 merged with S.B. 745, A.L. 2016 S.B. 656)\n\n*Effective 10-14-16, see § 21.250.

After six months, the sheriff who issued the expired concealed carry permit or certificate of qualification shall notify the concealed carry permit system that such permit is expired and cancelled. If the person has a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, the sheriff who issued the certificate of qualification for the endorsement shall notify the director of revenue that such certificate is expired regardless of whether the endorsement holder has applied for a concealed carry permit under subsection 3 of this section.

The sheriff in the new jurisdiction shall notify the sheriff in the old jurisdiction of the permit holder's change of address and the sheriff in the old jurisdiction shall transfer any information on file for the permit holder to the sheriff in the new jurisdiction within thirty days. The sheriff of the new jurisdiction may charge a processing fee of not more than ten dollars for any costs associated with notification of a change in residence. The sheriff shall report the residence change to the concealed carry permit system, take possession and destroy the old permit, and then issue a new permit to the permit holder. The new address shall be accessible by the concealed carry permit system within three days of receipt of the information. If the person has a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, the endorsement holder shall also furnish proof to the department of revenue of his or her residence change. In such cases, the change of residence shall be made by the department of revenue onto the individual's driving record.\n\n6. Any person issued a concealed carry permit pursuant to sections 571.101 to 571.121, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall notify the sheriff or his or her designee of the permit or endorsement holder's county or city of residence within seven days after actual knowledge of the loss or destruction of his or her permit or driver's license or nondriver's license containing a concealed carry endorsement. The permit or endorsement holder shall furnish a statement to the sheriff that the permit or driver's license or nondriver's license containing the concealed carry endorsement has been lost or destroyed. After notification of the loss or destruction of a permit or driver's license or nondriver's license containing a concealed carry endorsement, the sheriff may charge a processing fee of ten dollars for costs associated with replacing a lost or destroyed permit or driver's license or nondriver's license containing a concealed carry endorsement and shall reissue a new concealed carry permit within three working days of being notified by the concealed carry permit or endorsement holder of its loss or destruction.

The sheriff may charge a processing fee of not more than ten dollars for any costs associated with obtaining a corrected or new concealed carry permit. The permit or endorsement holder shall furnish proof of the name change to the sheriff within thirty days of changing his or her name and display his or her concealed carry permit or current driver's license or nondriver's license containing a concealed carry endorsement. The sheriff shall report the name change to the concealed carry permit system, and the new name shall be accessible by the concealed carry permit system within three days of receipt of the information.\n\n8. The person with a concealed carry permit, or endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall notify the sheriff of a name or address change within thirty days of the change. A concealed carry permit and, if applicable, endorsement shall be automatically invalid after one hundred eighty days if the permit or endorsement holder has changed his or her name or changed his or her residence and not notified the sheriff as required in subsections 5 and 7 of this section. The sheriff shall assess a late penalty of ten dollars per month for each month, up to six months and not to exceed sixty dollars, for the failure to notify the sheriff of the change of name or address within thirty days.\n\n9. (1) As used in this subsection, the term\"active military member\"means any person who is on active duty in the United States Armed Forces, on active state duty, on full-time National Guard duty under Title 32 of the United States Code.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if a concealed carry permit, or endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, expires while the person issued the permit or endorsement is an active military member, the permit shall be renewed if the person completes the renewal requirements under subsection 3 of this section within two months of returning to Missouri after discharge from such duty or recovery from such incapacitation. Once the two-month period has expired, the provisions of subsection 4 of this section shall apply except the penalties shall begin to accrue upon the expiration of the two-month period described in this subsection rather than on the expiration date of the permit or endorsement.\n\n(3) Beginning August 28, 2020, an active military member may complete the renewal of his or her endorsement or permit under subdivision (2) of this subsection*by mail. To renew an endorsement or permit by mail, an active military member shall mail to the sheriff who issued his or her permit a renewal application, a copy of his or her current concealed carry permit, a military identification acceptable for in-person renewal of permits, and the renewal fee.
