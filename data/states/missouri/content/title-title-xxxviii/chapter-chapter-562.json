A person is not guilty of an offense unless his or her liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act.\n\n2. A\"voluntary act\"is:\n\n(1) A bodily movement performed while conscious as a result of effort or determination; or\n\n(2) An omission to perform an act of which the actor is physically capable.\n\n3. Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procures or receives the thing possessed, or having acquired control of it was aware of his or her control for a sufficient time to have enabled him or her to dispose of it or terminate his or her control.\n\n4. A person is not guilty of an offense based solely upon an omission to perform an act unless the law defining the offense expressly so provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 60, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nEffective 1-01-17",

Guilt for an offense may be based upon an attempt to commit an offense if, with the purpose of committing the offense, a person performs any act which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A\"substantial step\"is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.\n\n2. It is no defense to a prosecution that the offense attempted was, under the actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.\n\n3. Unless otherwise set forth in the statute creating the offense, when guilt for a felony or misdemeanor is based upon an attempt to commit that offense, the felony or misdemeanor shall be classified one step lower than the class provided for the felony or misdemeanor in the statute creating the offense.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 60, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nTransferred 2014; formerly 564.011; Effective 1-01-17",

A person commits the offense of conspiracy to commit, in any manner or for any purpose, an offense if the person agrees, with one or more persons, to commit any class A, B, or C felony offense, or any unclassified felony offenses if the maximum term of imprisonment for such unclassified felony exceeds ten years or more, and one or more of such persons do any act in furtherance of such an agreement.\n\n2. It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or persons.\n\n3. If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one offense of conspiracy so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.\n\n4. (1) No person shall be convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense if, after conspiring to commit the offense, he or she prevented the accomplishment of the objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.\n\n(2) The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n5. For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:\n\n(1) A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;\n\n(2) If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him or her only if he or she advises those with whom he or she has conspired of his or her abandonment or he or she informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his or her participation in it.\n\n6.

If the definition of any offense prescribes a culpable mental state but does not specify the conduct, attendant circumstances or result to which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental state applies to each such material element.\n\n2. If the definition of an offense prescribes a culpable mental state with regard to a particular element or elements of that offense, the prescribed culpable mental state shall be required only as to specified element or elements, and a culpable mental state shall not be required as to any other element of the offense.\n\n3. Except as provided in subsection 2 of this section and section 562.026, if the definition of any offense does not expressly prescribe a culpable mental state for any elements of the offense, a culpable mental state is nonetheless required and is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly; but reckless or criminally negligent acts do not establish such culpable mental state.\n\n4. If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence as the culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely.\n\n5.

A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he or she believes his or her conduct does not constitute an offense unless his or her belief is reasonable and:\n\n(1) The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order which is not known to him or her and has not been published or otherwise made reasonably available to him or her, and he or she could not have acquired such knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him or her; or\n\n(2) He or she acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in:\n\n(a) A statute;\n\n(b) An opinion or order of an appellate court; or\n\n(c) An official interpretation of the statute, regulation or order defining the offense made by a public official or agency legally authorized to interpret such statute, regulation or order.\n\n3.
