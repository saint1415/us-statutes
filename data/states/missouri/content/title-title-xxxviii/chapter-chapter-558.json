A sentence to pay a fine, when imposed on a corporation for an offense defined in this code or for any offense defined outside this code for which no specific corporate fine is specified, shall be a sentence to pay an amount, fixed by the court, which does not exceed:\n\n(1) For a felony, twenty thousand dollars;\n\n(2) For a misdemeanor, ten thousand dollars;\n\n(3) For an infraction, one thousand dollars; or\n\n(4) If the corporation has gained money or property through the commission of the offense, to pay an amount, fixed by the court, not exceeding double the amount of the corporation's gain from the commission of the offense.\n\n3. As used in this section the term\"gain\"means the amount of money or the value of property derived from the commission of the offense. The amount of money or value of property returned to the victim of the offense or seized by or surrendered to lawful authority prior to the time sentence is imposed shall be deducted from the fine. When the court imposes a fine based on gain the court shall make a finding as to the amount of the offender's gain from the crime. If the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support such a finding, the court may conduct a hearing upon the issue.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 60, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nTransferred 2014; formerly 560.011; Effective 1-01-17",

In determining the amount and the method of payment of a fine, the court shall, insofar as practicable, proportion the fine to the burden that payment will impose in view of the financial resources of an individual. The court shall not sentence an offender to pay a fine in any amount which will prevent him or her from making restitution or reparation to the victim of the offense.\n\n2. When any other disposition is authorized by statute, the court shall not sentence an individual to pay a fine only unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and character of the offender, it is of the opinion that the fine alone will suffice for the protection of the public.\n\n3. The court shall not sentence an individual to pay a fine in addition to any other sentence authorized by section 557.011 unless:\n\n(1) He or she has derived a pecuniary gain from the offense; or\n\n(2) The court is of the opinion that a fine is uniquely adapted to deterrence of the type of offense involved or to the correction of the defendant.\n\n4.

In cases of class D and E felonies, the court shall have discretion to imprison for a special term not to exceed one year in the county jail or other authorized penal institution, and the place of confinement shall be fixed by the court. If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term longer than one year upon a person convicted of a class D or E felony, it shall commit the person to the custody of the department of corrections.\n\n3. (1) When a regular sentence of imprisonment for a felony is imposed, the court shall commit the person to the custody of the department of corrections for the term imposed under section 557.036, or until released under procedures established elsewhere by law.\n\n(2) A sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall be for a definite term and the court shall commit the person to the county jail or other authorized penal institution for the term of his or her sentence or until released under procedure established elsewhere by law.\n\n4. (1) Except as otherwise provided, a sentence of imprisonment for a term of years for felonies other than dangerous felonies as defined in section 556.061, and other than sentences of imprisonment which involve the individual's fourth or subsequent remand to the department of corrections shall consist of a prison term and a conditional release term. The conditional release term of any term imposed under section 557.036 shall be:\n\n(a) One-third for terms of nine years or less;\n\n(b) Three years for terms between nine and fifteen years;\n\n(c) Five years for terms more than fifteen years; and the prison term shall be the remainder of such term. The prison term may be extended by the parole board pursuant to subsection 5 of this section.\n\n(2)\"Conditional release\"means the conditional discharge of an offender by the parole board, subject to conditions of release that the parole board deems reasonable to assist the offender to lead a law-abiding life, and subject to the supervision under the division of probation and parole. The conditions of release shall include avoidance by the offender of any other offense, federal or state, and other conditions that the parole board in its discretion deems reasonably necessary to assist the releasee in avoiding further violation of the law.\n\n5. The date of conditional release from the prison term may be extended up to a maximum of the entire sentence of imprisonment by the parole board. The director of any division of the department of corrections except the division of probation and parole may file with the parole board a petition to extend the conditional release date when an offender fails to follow the rules and regulations of the division or commits an act in violation of such rules. Within ten working days of receipt of the petition to extend the conditional release date, the parole board shall convene a hearing on the petition. The offender shall be present and may call witnesses in his or her behalf and cross-examine witnesses appearing against the offender. The hearing shall be conducted as provided in section 217.670. If the violation occurs in close proximity to the conditional release date, the conditional release may be held for a maximum of fifteen working days to permit necessary time for the division director to file a petition for an extension with the parole board and for the parole board to conduct a hearing, provided some affirmative manifestation of an intent to extend the conditional release has occurred prior to the conditional release date. If at the end of a fifteen-working-day period a parole board decision has not been reached, the offender shall be released conditionally. The decision of the parole board shall be final.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 60, A.L. 1979 S.B. 234, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1196, A.L. 1984 S.B. 611, A.L. 1990 H.B. 974, A.L. 1994 S.B. 763, A.L. 2003 S.B. 5, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60)\n\n(2010) Statutory amendment in 1990 removing conditional release eligibility for inmates convicted of certain violent felonies is constitutional under original purpose, single subject, ex post facto, and retrospective provisions.

For the purposes of this section,\"prison commitment\"means and is the receipt by the department of corrections of an offender after sentencing. For purposes of this section, prior prison commitments to the department of corrections shall not include an offender's first incarceration prior to release on probation under section 217.362 or 559.115. Other provisions of the law to the contrary notwithstanding, any offender who has been found guilty of a felony other than a dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061 and is committed to the department of corrections shall be required to serve the following minimum prison terms:\n\n(1) If the offender has one previous prison commitment to the department of corrections for a felony offense, the minimum prison term which the offender must serve shall be forty percent of his or her sentence or until the offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at least thirty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first;\n\n(2) If the offender has two previous prison commitments to the department of corrections for felonies unrelated to the present offense, the minimum prison term which the offender must serve shall be fifty percent of his or her sentence or until the offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at least forty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first;\n\n(3) If the offender has three or more previous prison commitments to the department of corrections for felonies unrelated to the present offense, the minimum prison term which the offender must serve shall be eighty percent of his or her sentence or until the offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at least forty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first.\n\n3. Other provisions of the law to the contrary notwithstanding, any offender who has been found guilty of a dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061 and is committed to the department of corrections shall be required to serve a minimum prison term of eighty-five percent of the sentence imposed by the court or until the offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at least forty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first.\n\n4.

For purposes of this section, the term\"minimum prison term\"shall mean time required to be served by the offender before he or she is eligible for parole, conditional release or other early release by the department of corrections.\n\n6. An offender who was convicted of, or pled guilty to, a felony offense other than those offenses listed in subsection 2 of this section prior to August 28, 2019, shall no longer be subject to the minimum prison term provisions under subsection 2 of this section, and shall be eligible for parole, conditional release, or other early release by the department of corrections according to the rules and regulations of the department.\n\n7. (1) A sentencing advisory commission is hereby created to consist of eleven members. One member shall be appointed by the speaker of the house. One member shall be appointed by the president pro tem of the senate. One member shall be the director of the department of corrections. Six members shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor from among the following: the public defender commission; private citizens; a private member of the Missouri Bar; the board of probation and parole; and a prosecutor. Two members shall be appointed by the supreme court, one from a metropolitan area and one from a rural area. All members shall be appointed to a four-year term. All members of the sentencing commission appointed prior to August 28, 1994, shall continue to serve on the sentencing advisory commission at the pleasure of the governor.\n\n(2) The commission shall study sentencing practices in the circuit courts throughout the state for the purpose of determining whether and to what extent disparities exist among the various circuit courts with respect to the length of sentences imposed and the use of probation for offenders convicted of the same or similar offenses and with similar criminal histories. The commission shall also study and examine whether and to what extent sentencing disparity among economic and social classes exists in relation to the sentence of death and if so, the reasons therefor, if sentences are comparable to other states, if the length of the sentence is appropriate, and the rate of rehabilitation based on sentence. It shall compile statistics, examine cases, draw conclusions, and perform other duties relevant to the research and investigation of disparities in death penalty sentencing among economic and social classes.\n\n(3) The commission shall study alternative sentences, prison work programs, work release, home-based incarceration, probation and parole options, and any other programs and report the feasibility of these options in Missouri.\n\n(4) The governor shall select a chairperson who shall call meetings of the commission as required or permitted pursuant to the purpose of the sentencing commission.\n\n(5) The members of the commission shall not receive compensation for their duties on the commission, but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of these duties and for which they are not reimbursed by reason of their other paid positions.\n\n(6) The circuit and associate circuit courts of this state, the office of the state courts administrator, the department of public safety, and the department of corrections shall cooperate with the commission by providing information or access to information needed by the commission. The office of the state courts administrator will provide needed staffing resources.\n\n8. Courts shall retain discretion to lower or exceed the sentence recommended by the commission as otherwise allowable by law, and to order restorative justice methods, when applicable.\n\n9. If the imposition or execution of a sentence is suspended, the court may order any or all of the following restorative justice methods, or any other method that the court finds just or appropriate:\n\n(1) Restitution to any victim or a statutorily created fund for costs incurred as a result of the offender's actions;\n\n(2) Offender treatment programs;\n\n(3) Mandatory community service;\n\n(4) Work release programs in local facilities; and\n\n(5) Community-based residential and nonresidential programs.\n\n10. Pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of this section, the court may order the assessment and payment of a designated amount of restitution to a county law enforcement restitution fund established by the county commission pursuant to section 50.565. Such contribution shall not exceed three hundred dollars for any charged offense. Any restitution moneys deposited into the county law enforcement restitution fund pursuant to this section shall only be expended pursuant to the provisions of section 50.565.\n\n11. A judge may order payment to a restitution fund only if such fund had been created by ordinance or resolution of a county of the state of Missouri prior to sentencing. A judge shall not have any direct supervisory authority or administrative control over any fund to which the judge is ordering a person to make payment.\n\n12. A person who fails to make a payment to a county law enforcement restitution fund may not have his or her probation revoked solely for failing to make such payment unless the judge, after evidentiary hearing, makes a finding supported by a preponderance of the evidence that the person either willfully refused to make the payment or that the person willfully, intentionally, and purposefully failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to pay.\n\n13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow the sentencing advisory commission to issue recommended sentences in specific cases pending in the courts of this state.\n\n(L. 1986 H.B. 1098 § 1, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1340 & 1348, A.L. 1989 S.B. 215 & 58, A.L. 1990 H.B. 974, A.L. 1993 H.B. 562, A.L. 1994 S.B. 763, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1508 merged with S.B. 766, A.L. 2003 S.B. 5, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1055, A.L. 2005 H.B. 353, A.L. 2012 S.B. 628, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1371, A.L. 2019 H.B. 192, A.L. 2024 S.B. 754, et al.)\n\n(2018) General Assembly did not express its intent to have 2017 amendment to section apply retroactively, thus it only applies prospectively.

Multiple sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently unless the court specifies that they shall run consecutively; except in the case of multiple sentences of imprisonment imposed for any offense committed during or at the same time as, or multiple offenses of, the following felonies:\n\n(1) Rape in the first degree, forcible rape, or rape;\n\n(2) Statutory rape in the first degree;\n\n(3) Sodomy in the first degree, forcible sodomy, or sodomy;\n\n(4) Statutory sodomy in the first degree; or\n\n(5) An attempt to commit any of the felonies listed in this subsection. In such case, the sentence of imprisonment imposed for any felony listed in this subsection or an attempt to commit any of the aforesaid shall run consecutively to the other sentences. The sentences imposed for any other offense may run concurrently.\n\n2. If a person who is on probation, parole or conditional release is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed after the granting of probation or parole or after the start of his or her conditional release term, the court shall direct the manner in which the sentence or sentences imposed by the court shall run with respect to any resulting probation, parole or conditional release revocation term or terms. If the subsequent sentence to imprisonment is in another jurisdiction, the court shall specify how any resulting probation, parole or conditional release revocation term or terms shall run with respect to the foreign sentence of imprisonment.\n\n3. A court may cause any sentence it imposes to run concurrently with a sentence an individual is serving or is to serve in another state or in a federal correctional center. If the Missouri sentence is served in another state or in a federal correctional center, subsection 4 of section 558.011 and section 217.690 shall apply as if the individual were serving his or her sentence within the department of corrections of the state of Missouri, except that a personal hearing before the parole board shall not be required for parole consideration.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 60, A.L. 1980 H.B. 1138, et al., A.L. 1982 H.B. 1196, A.L. 1983 H.B. 713 Revision, A.L. 1995 H.B. 424, A.L. 2013 H.B. 215, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60)\n\n(1985) Court construed this section to mandate consecutive sentences for rape and sodomy committed by defendant at the same time.

A sentence of imprisonment shall commence when a person convicted of an offense in this state is received into the custody of the department of corrections or other place of confinement where the offender is sentenced.\n\n2. Such person shall receive credit toward the service of a sentence of imprisonment for all time in prison, jail or custody after the offense occurred and before the commencement of the sentence, when the time in custody was related to that offense. This credit shall be based upon the certification of the sheriff as provided in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 217.305 and may be supplemented by a certificate of a sheriff or other custodial officer from another jurisdiction having held the person on the charge of the offense for which the sentence of imprisonment is ordered.\n\n3. The officer required by law to deliver a person convicted of an offense in this state to the department of corrections shall endorse upon the papers required by section 217.305 both the dates the offender was in custody and the period of time to be credited toward the service of the sentence of imprisonment, except as endorsed by such officer.\n\n4. If a person convicted of an offense escapes from custody, such escape shall interrupt the sentence. The interruption shall continue until such person is returned to the correctional center where the sentence was being served, or in the case of a person committed to the custody of the department of corrections, to any correctional center operated by the department of corrections. An escape shall also interrupt the jail time credit to be applied to a sentence which had not commenced when the escape occurred.\n\n5. If a sentence of imprisonment is vacated and a new sentence imposed upon the offender for that offense, all time served under the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence, unless the time has already been credited to another sentence as provided in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n6. If a person released from imprisonment on parole or serving a conditional release term violates any of the conditions of his or her parole or release, he or she may be treated as a parole violator.
