Each homicide offense which is lawfully joined in the same indictment or information together with any homicide offense or offense other than a homicide shall be charged together with such offense in separate counts. A count charging any offense of homicide may only be charged and tried together with one or more counts of any other homicide or offense other than a homicide as provided in subsection 2 of section 545.140. Except as provided in subsections 2, 3, and 4 of this section, no murder in the first degree offense may be tried together with any offense other than murder in the first degree. In the event of a joinder of homicide offenses, all offenses charged which are supported by the evidence in the case, together with all proper lesser offenses under section 565.029, shall, when requested by one of the parties or the court, be submitted to the jury or, in a jury-waived trial, considered by the judge.\n\n2.

This subsection in no way limits the right to try in the conjunctive, where they are properly joined under subsection 1 of this section, either separate offenses other than murder in the first degree or separate offenses of murder in the first degree committed against different individuals.\n\n3.

In such case the judge will assess punishment on any offense joined with a murder in the first degree charge according to law and, when the trier is a jury, it shall be instructed upon punishment on the charge of murder in the first degree in accordance with section 565.030.\n\n4. When the state waives the death penalty for a murder first degree offense, that offense may be tried and submitted to the trier together with any other charge with which it is lawfully joined.\n\n(L. 1983 S.B. 276, A.L. 1984 S.B. 448 § A, A.L. 1993 S.B. 180, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nEffective 1-01-17\n\n(1989) Plain language of statute indicates circumstances allowing joinder of offenses with first degree murder are limited; however, where the charges arise from the same transaction and relate to acts committed against the same victim, the murder and armed criminal action can be joined and tried together.

The attorneys may then argue as in other criminal cases the issue of punishment, after which the trier shall assess and declare the punishment as in all other criminal cases.\n\n4. If the trier at the first stage of a trial where the death penalty was not waived finds the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, a second stage of the trial shall proceed at which the only issue shall be the punishment to be assessed and declared. Evidence in aggravation and mitigation of punishment, including but not limited to evidence supporting any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances listed in subsection 2 or 3 of section 565.032, may be presented subject to the rules of evidence at criminal trials. Such evidence may include, within the discretion of the court, evidence concerning the murder victim and the impact of the offense upon the family of the victim and others. Rebuttal and surrebuttal evidence may be presented. The state shall be the first to proceed. If the trier is a jury it shall be instructed on the law. The attorneys may then argue the issue of punishment to the jury, and the state shall have the right to open and close the argument. The trier shall assess and declare the punishment at life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release except by act of the governor:\n\n(1) If the trier finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is intellectually disabled; or\n\n(2) If the trier does not find beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances set out in subsection 2 of section 565.032; or\n\n(3) If the trier concludes that there is evidence in mitigation of punishment, including but not limited to evidence supporting the statutory mitigating circumstances listed in subsection 3 of section 565.032, which is sufficient to outweigh the evidence in aggravation of punishment found by the trier; or\n\n(4) If the trier decides under all of the circumstances not to assess and declare the punishment at death. If the trier is a jury it shall be so instructed.\n\n­­If the trier assesses and declares the punishment at death it shall, in its findings or verdict, set out in writing the aggravating circumstance or circumstances listed in subsection 2 of section 565.032 which it found beyond a reasonable doubt. If the trier is a jury it shall be instructed before the case is submitted that if it is unable to decide or agree upon the punishment the court shall assess and declare the punishment at life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release except by act of the governor or death. The court shall follow the same procedure as set out in this section whenever it is required to determine punishment for murder in the first degree.\n\n5. Upon written agreement of the parties and with leave of the court, the issue of the defendant's intellectual disability may be taken up by the court and decided prior to trial without prejudicing the defendant's right to have the issue submitted to the trier of fact as provided in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n6. As used in this section, the terms\"intellectual disability\"or\"intellectually disabled\"refer to a condition involving substantial limitations in general functioning characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning with continual extensive related deficits and limitations in two or more adaptive behaviors such as communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure and work, which conditions are manifested and documented before eighteen years of age.\n\n7. The provisions of this section shall only govern offenses committed on or after August 28, 2001.\n\n(L. 1983 S.B. 276, A.L. 1984 S.B. 448 § A, A.L. 1993 H.B. 562, A.L. 2001 S.B. 267, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1064, A.L. 2016 H.B. 2332 merged with S.B. 590)\n\n(2003) Allowing trial judge independently to go through four-step process required by subsection 4 of section once jury deadlocked on defendant's punishment violates Ring v.

The office of the assistant to the supreme court shall be attached to the office of the clerk of the supreme court for administrative purposes.\n\n7. In addition to the mandatory sentence review, there shall be a right of direct appeal of the conviction to the supreme court of Missouri. This right of appeal may be waived by the defendant.

In no event shall the mother be criminally responsible pursuant to this section for the acts of the physician if the physician is not held criminally responsible pursuant to this section.\n\n6. This section shall not apply to any person who performs or attempts to perform a legal abortion if the act that causes the death is performed prior to the child being partially born, even though the death of the child occurs as a result of the abortion after the child is partially born.\n\n7. Only that person who performs the overt act required under subsection 3 of this section shall be culpable under this section, unless a person, with the purpose of committing infanticide, does any act which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense which results in the death of the living infant. A\"substantial step\"is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.\n\n8. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to exclude the defenses otherwise available to any person under the law including defenses provided pursuant to chapters 562 and 563.\n\n(L. 1999 H.B. 427, et al., A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nEffective 1-01-17\n\n(2002) Section does not contain an exception to liability for actions undertaken to preserve the life of the mother, and the culpable mens rea of the physician must begin before performing the procedure rather than during the procedure. State v. Reproductive Health Services, 97 S.W.3d 54 (Mo.App.E.D.).\n\n(2004) Section is unconstitutional due to absence of exception to protect health of the pregnant woman, as enunciated by United States Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000). Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood v. Nixon, 325 F.Supp.2d 991 (W.D.Mo.), aff'd., 429 F.3d 803 (8th Cir.).",
