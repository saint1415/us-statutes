The tax authorized by this section shall be in addition to any and all other sales taxes allowed by law, except that no order or ordinance imposing a sales tax under the provisions of this section shall be effective unless the governing body of the city or county submits to the voters of the city or county, at a city, county or state general, primary, or special election, a proposal to authorize the governing body of the city or county to impose a tax.\n\n2. The ballot of submission shall contain, but need not be limited to, the following language:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the proposal, then the ordinance or order and any amendments thereto shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter after the director of revenue receives notice of adoption of the tax. If a majority of the votes cast by the qualified voters voting are opposed to the proposal, then the governing body of the city or county shall have no power to impose the sales tax authorized by this section unless and until the governing body of the city or county shall again have submitted another proposal to authorize the governing body of the city or county to impose the sales tax authorized by this section and such proposal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting thereon.\n\n3. All revenue received by a city or county from the tax authorized under the provisions of this section shall be deposited in a special trust fund and shall be used by the city or county for the investigation of the backgrounds of persons employed at any adult cabaret in such city or county and for the general law enforcement use of the sheriff's office. Any funds in such special trust fund which are not needed for current expenditures may be invested by the governing body in accordance with applicable laws relating to the investment of other city or county funds.\n\n4. The tax authorized by this section shall terminate four years from the date on which such tax was initially imposed by the city or county, unless sooner abolished by the governing body of the city or county.\n\n5. All sales taxes collected by the director of revenue under this section on behalf of any city or county, less one percent for cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund after payment of premiums for surety bonds as provided in section 32.087, shall be deposited with the state treasurer in a special trust fund, which is hereby created, to be known as the \"City and County Background Check Tax Trust Fund\". The moneys in the trust fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the trust fund which was collected in each city or county imposing a sales tax under this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of the city or county and the public. Not later than the tenth day of each month, the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the trust fund during the preceding month to the city or county which levied the tax. Such funds shall be deposited with the city or county treasurer of each such city or county, and all expenditures of funds arising from the trust fund shall be by an appropriation act to be enacted by the governing body of each such city or county.\n\n6. The director of revenue may authorize the state treasurer to make refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to any city or county for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such cities or counties. If any city or county abolishes the tax, the city or county shall notify the director of revenue of the action at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the repeal and the director of revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such city or county, the director of revenue shall authorize the state treasurer to remit the balance in the account to the city or county and close the account of that city or county. The director of revenue shall notify each city or county of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the city or county.\n\n7. Except as modified in this section, all provisions of sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed under this section.\n\n8.

It is the purpose of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this state, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the state. The provisions of sections 573.525 to 573.537 have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.\n\n2. The general assembly finds that:\n\n(1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial enterprises, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including but not limited to personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation;\n\n(2) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area;\n\n(3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the state has a substantial interest in preventing or abating, or both. Such substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the state's rationale for sections 573.525 to 573.537, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the state's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the state.\n\n(L. 2010 S.B. 586 & 617)",
