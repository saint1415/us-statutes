Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay the lease charges to the lessor within seven days after written demand for the return has been sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this section, except that if a motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, such failure to return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the crime of stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor vehicle to be put into any appropriate state and local computer system listing stolen motor vehicles. Any law enforcement officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor vehicle and notify the lessor that he may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed and its vehicle identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day period prescribed in this subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for the violation.\n\n4. This section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable, if the lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, or within ten days after proper notice.\n\n5. Any person who has leased or rented personal property of another who destroys such property so as to avoid returning it to the owner commits the offense of property damage pursuant to section 569.100 or 569.120, in addition to being in violation of this section.\n\n6. Venue shall lie in the county where the personal property was originally rented or leased.\n\n7.

The same person may not be charged with unlawfully receiving public assistance benefits and perjury pursuant to this section when both offenses arise from the same application for benefits.\n\n2. A statement or fact is material, regardless of its admissibility under rules of evidence, if it could substantially affect or did substantially affect the granting of public assistance.\n\n3. Knowledge of the materiality of the statement or fact is not an element of this offense, and it is no defense that:\n\n(1) The person mistakenly believed the fact to be immaterial; or\n\n(2) The person was not competent, for reasons other than mental disability, to make the statement.\n\n4. The offense of perjury for the purpose of obtaining public assistance is a class A misdemeanor, unless the value of the public assistance unlawfully obtained or unlawfully attempted to be obtained is seven hundred fifty dollars or more, in which case it is a class E felony, or the person has previously been found guilty of two violations under sections 570.400 to 570.410, in which case it is a class D felony.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 259 § 6, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1888, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nTransferred 2014; formerly 578.385; Effective 1-01-17",
