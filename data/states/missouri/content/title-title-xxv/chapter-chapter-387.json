Upon the enactment of this section*, any municipality or other local entity's ordinance or policy that is inconsistent with sections 387.400 to 387.440 shall be void and shall have no force or effect.\n\n2. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an income tax imposed by the state or an earnings tax.\n\n3.

Sections 387.400 to 387.440 and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2017, shall be invalid and void.\n\n4. (1) Subject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, nothing in sections 387.400 to 387.440 shall restrict or limit an airport from:\n\n(a) Charging reasonable fees for the use of the airport or its facilities, provided that the fee is not assessed on a per-passenger basis.
