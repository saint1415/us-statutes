Adequate service — just and reasonable charges — unjust discrimination — unreasonable preference — reduced rates permitted for federal lifeline connection plan — delivery of telephone and telegraph messages — customer — specific pricing — term agreements, discount rates. —1. Every telecommunications company shall furnish and provide with respect to its business such instrumentalities and facilities as shall be adequate and in all respects just and reasonable. All charges made and demanded by any telecommunications company for any service rendered or to be rendered in connection therewith shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by law or by order or decision of the commission. Every unjust or unreasonable charge made or demanded for any such service or in connection therewith or in excess of that allowed by law or by order or decision of the commission is prohibited and declared to be unlawful.\n\n2. No telecommunications company shall directly or indirectly or by any special rate, rebate, drawback or other device or method charge, demand, collect or receive from any person or corporation a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered with respect to telecommunications or in connection therewith, except as authorized in this chapter, than it charges, demands, collects or receives from any other person or corporation for doing a like and contemporaneous service with respect to telecommunications under the same or substantially the same circumstances and conditions. Promotional programs for telecommunications services may be offered by telecommunications companies for periods of time so long as the offer is otherwise consistent with the provisions of this chapter and approved by the commission. Neither this subsection nor subsection 3 of this section shall be construed to prohibit an economy rate telephone service offering. This section and section 392.220 to the contrary notwithstanding, the commission is authorized to approve tariffs filed by local exchange telecommunications companies which elect to provide reduced charges for residential telecommunications connection services pursuant to the lifeline connection assistance plan as promulgated by the federal communications commission. Eligible subscribers for such connection services shall be those as defined by participating local exchange telecommunications company tariffs.\n\n3. No telecommunications company shall make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person, corporation or locality, or subject any particular person, corporation or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever except that telecommunications messages may be classified into such classes as are just and reasonable, and different rates may be charged for the different classes of messages.\n\n4. (1) No telecommunications company may define a telecommunications service as a different telecommunications service based on the geographic area or other market segmentation within which such telecommunications service is offered or provided, unless the telecommunications company makes application and files a tariff or tariffs which propose relief from this subsection. Any such tariff shall be subject to the provisions of sections 392.220 and 392.230 and in any hearing thereon the burden shall be on the telecommunications company to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the definition of such service based on the geographic area or other market within which such service is offered is reasonably necessary to promote the public interest and the purposes and policies of this chapter.\n\n(2) It is the intent of this act to bring the benefits of competition to all customers and to ensure that incumbent and alternative local exchange telecommunications companies have the opportunity to price and market telecommunications services to all prospective customers in any geographic area in which they compete. To promote the goals of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, for an alternative local exchange telecommunications company or for an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company in any exchange where an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company has been classified competitive under sections 392.245 and 392.361, an alternative local exchange telecommunications company has been certified and is providing basic local telecommunications services or switched exchange access services, or an interconnected voice over internet protocol service provider has been registered and is providing local voice service, the commission shall review and approve or reject, within forty-five days of filing, tariffs for proposed different services as follows:\n\n(a) For services proposed on an exchangewide basis, it shall be presumed that a tariff which defines and establishes prices for a local exchange telecommunications service or exchange access service as a different telecommunications service in the geographic area, no smaller than an exchange, within which such local exchange telecommunications service or exchange access service is offered is reasonably necessary to promote the public interest and the purposes and policies of this chapter;\n\n(b) For services proposed in a geographic area smaller than an exchange or other market segmentation within which or to whom such telecommunications service is proposed to be offered, a local exchange telecommunications company may petition the commission to define and establish a local exchange telecommunications service or exchange access service as a different local exchange telecommunications service or exchange access service. The commission shall approve such a proposal unless it finds that such service in a smaller geographic area or such other market segmentation is contrary to the public interest or is contrary to the purposes of this chapter. Upon approval of such a smaller geographic area or such other market segmentation for a different service for one local exchange telecommunications company, all other local exchange telecommunications companies certified to provide service in that exchange may file a tariff to use such smaller geographic area or such other market segmentation to provide that service;\n\n(c) For proposed different services described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision, the local exchange telecommunications company which files a tariff to provide such service shall provide the service to all similarly situated customers, upon request in accordance with that company's approved tariff, in the exchange or geographic area smaller than an exchange or such other market segmentation for which the tariff was filed, and no price proposed for such service by an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company, other than for a competitive service, shall be lower than its long-run incremental cost, as defined in section 386.020.\n\n(3) The commission, on its own motion or upon motion of the public counsel, may by order, after notice and hearing, define a telecommunications service offered or provided by a telecommunications company as a different telecommunications service dependent upon the geographic area or other market within which such telecommunications service is offered or provided and apply different service classifications to such service only upon a finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that such different treatment is reasonably necessary to promote the public interest and the purposes and policies of this chapter.\n\n5. No telecommunications company may charge a different price per minute or other unit of measure for the same, substitutable, or equivalent interexchange telecommunications service provided over the same or equivalent distance between two points without filing a tariff for the offer or provision of such service pursuant to sections 392.220 and 392.230. In any proceeding under sections 392.220 and 392.230 wherein a telecommunications company seeks to charge a different price per minute or other unit of measure for the same, substitutable, or equivalent interexchange service, the burden shall be on the subject telecommunications company to show that such charges are in the public interest and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this chapter. The commission may modify or prohibit such charges if the subject telecommunications company fails to show that such charges are in the public interest and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this chapter. This subsection shall not apply to reasonable price discounts based on the volume of service provided, so long as such discounts are nondiscriminatory and offered under the same rates, terms, and conditions throughout a telecommunications company's certificated or service area.\n\n6. Every telecommunications company operating in this state shall receive, transmit and deliver, without discrimination or delay, the conversations and messages of every other telecommunications company with whose facilities a connection may have been made.\n\n7. The commission shall have power to provide the limits within which telecommunications messages shall be delivered without extra charge.\n\n8. Customer-specific pricing is authorized on an equal basis for incumbent and alternative local exchange companies, and for interexchange telecommunications companies for:\n\n(1) Dedicated, nonswitched, private line and special access services;\n\n(2) Central office-based switching systems which substitute for customer premise, private branch exchange (PBX) services; and\n\n(3) Any business service offered in an exchange in which basic local telecommunications service offered by the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company has been declared competitive under section 392.245, and any retail business service offered to an end-user in a noncompetitive exchange.\n\n9. This act shall not be construed to prohibit the commission, upon determining that it is in the public interest, from altering local exchange boundaries, provided that the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company or companies serving each exchange for which the boundaries are altered provide notice to the commission that the companies approve the alteration of exchange boundaries.\n\n10. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, every telecommunications company is authorized to offer term agreements of up to five years on any of its telecommunications services.\n\n11. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, every telecommunications company is authorized to offer discounted rates or special promotions on any of its telecommunications services to any existing, new, and/or former customers.\n\n12. Packages of services may be offered on an equal basis by incumbent and alternative local exchange companies and shall not be subject to regulation under section 392.240 or 392.245, nor shall packages of services be subject to the provisions of subsections 1 through 5 of this section, provided that each telecommunications service included in a package is available apart from the package of services and still subject to regulation under section 392.240 or 392.245. For the purposes of this subsection, a\"package of services\"includes more than one telecommunications service or one or more telecommunications service combined with one or more nontelecommunications service. Any tariff to introduce a new package or to make any change to an existing package, except for the elimination of a package, shall be filed, on an informational basis, with the commission at least one day prior to the introduction of such new package or implementation of such change. Any tariff to eliminate an existing package shall be filed, on an informational basis, with the commission at least ten days prior to the elimination of the package.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5664, A.L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1670, A.L. 1996 S.B. 507, A.L. 2003 H.B. 208, A.L. 2005 S.B. 237, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1779)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5208; 1919 § 10496\n\nCROSS REFERENCES:\n\nCities of the third class, 77.490\n\nRegulation and supervision by public service commission, 386.320\n\n(1963) Finding by Public Service Commission that telephone company's refusal to accept television service corporation's advertising in telephone directory as submitted because it implied that corporation was rendering free service was not unreasonable or unlawful discrimination was supported by substantial evidence.

Every telecommunications company shall file with the commission an annual report at a time and covering the yearly period fixed by the commission. Such annual report shall be verified by the oath of the president, treasurer, general manager or receiver, if any, of any of such companies, or by the person required to file the same. Verification shall be made by the official holding office at the time of the filing of such report, and if not made upon the knowledge of the person verifying, the same shall set forth in general terms the sources of his information and the grounds for his belief as to any matters not stated to be verified on his knowledge. The commission shall prescribe the form of such reports and the character of the information to be contained therein and may, from time to time, make such changes and additions in regard to form and contents thereof as it may deem proper, and shall furnish a blank form for such annual reports to every telecommunications company required to make the same. The form of such reports shall follow, as nearly as may be, the form prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission. When the report of any telecommunications company is defective or erroneous, the commission shall notify the company to amend the same within a time prescribed by the commission. Such reports shall be preserved in the office of the commission. The commission may require of any telecommunications company specific answers to questions upon which the commission may desire information. If any telecommunications company shall fail to make and file its annual report as and when required or within such extended time as the commission may allow, or shall fail to make specific answers to any question within the period specified by the commission for the making and filing of such answers, such company shall forfeit to the state the sum of one hundred dollars for each and every day it shall continue to be in default with respect to such report or answer. Such forfeiture shall be recovered in an action brought by the commission in the name of the state of Missouri. The amount recovered in any such action shall be paid to the public school fund of the state. The commission may, when it deems it advisable, exempt any telecommunications company from the necessity of filing annual reports until the further order of the commission.\n\n2. The commission may establish a system of accounts to be used by telecommunications companies, which are required to make annual reports to it, or classify the companies, and prescribe a system of accounts for each class and may prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. The system of accounts required shall follow, as nearly as may be, the system prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission. It may also, in its discretion, prescribe the form of records to be kept by such companies. The commission shall at all times have access to all accounts, records and memoranda kept by telecommunications companies, and may designate any of its officers or employees who shall thereupon be authorized under the order of the commission to inspect and examine any and all accounts, records and memoranda kept by any such company; and the commission may, after hearing, prescribe, by order, the accounts in which particular outlays and receipts shall be entered, charged or credited. Any employee or agent of the commission who divulges any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the course of any such inspection or examination, except insofar as he may be directed by the commission by regulation or otherwise, or by a court or judge thereof, or authorized by law, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Rates, schedules, suspension of, when — revocation of certificate of service, penalty. —1. Every telecommunications company shall print and file with the commission schedules showing the rates, rentals and charges for service of each and every kind by or over its facilities between points in this state and between each point upon its facilities and all points upon all facilities leased or operated by it and between each point upon its facilities or upon any facility leased or operated by it and all points upon the line of any other telecommunications company whenever a through service or joint rate shall have been established between any two points. If no joint rate over through facilities has been established, the several companies joined over such through facilities shall file with the commission the separately established rates and charges applicable where through service is afforded. Such schedule shall plainly state the places between which telecommunications service will be rendered and shall also state separately all charges and all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations or forms of contract which may in any wise change, affect or determine any or the aggregate of the rates, rentals or charges for the service rendered. Such schedule shall be plainly printed and kept open to public inspection. The commission shall have the power to prescribe the form of every such schedule and may from time to time prescribe, by order, changes in the form thereof. The commission shall also have power to establish rules and regulations for keeping such schedules open to public inspection and may from time to time modify the same. Every telecommunications company shall file with the commission as and when required by it a copy of any contract, agreement or arrangement in writing with any other telecommunications company or with any other corporation, association or person relating in any way to the construction, maintenance or use of telecommunications facilities or service by or rates and charges over or upon any facilities.\n\n2. Unless the commission otherwise orders, and except for the rates charged by a telephone cooperative for providing telecommunications service within an exchange or within a local calling scope as determined by the commission other than the rates for exchange access service, no change shall be made in any rate, charge or rental, or joint rate, charge or rental which shall have been filed by a telecommunications company in compliance with the requirements of sections 392.190 to 392.530, except after thirty days' notice to the commission, which notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the schedule then in force and the time when the changed rate, charge or rental shall go into effect; and all proposed changes shall be shown by filing new schedules or shall be plainly indicated upon the schedules filed and in force at the time and kept open to public inspection. The commission for good cause shown may allow changes in rates, charges or rentals without requiring the thirty days' notice, under such conditions as it may prescribe. All such changes shall be immediately indicated upon its schedules by such telecommunications company. No telecommunications company shall charge, demand, collect or receive a different compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered than the charge applicable to such service as specified in its schedule on file and in effect at that time. No telecommunications company shall refund or remit directly or indirectly any portion of the rate or charge so specified, nor extend to any person or corporation any form of contract or agreement, or any rule or regulation, or any privilege or facility other than such privileges and facilities as are contemplated by sections 392.200, 392.245, and 392.455, except such as are specified in its schedule filed and in effect at the time and regularly and uniformly extended to all persons and corporations under like circumstances for a like or substantially similar service.\n\n3. No telecommunications company subject to the provisions of this law shall, directly or indirectly, give any free or reduced service, or any free pass or frank for the provision of telecommunications services between points within this state, except to its officers, employees, agents, surgeons, physicians, attorneys at law and their families; to persons or corporations exclusively engaged in charitable and eleemosynary work and ministers of religions; to officers and employees of other telegraph corporations and telephone corporations, railroad corporations and street railroad corporations; public education institutions, public libraries and not-for-profit health care institutions. This subsection shall not apply to state, municipal or federal contracts.\n\n4. Any proposed rate or charge for any new telecommunications service which has not previously been provided by a telecommunications company to its Missouri customers may be suspended by the commission for a period not to exceed thirty days from the proposed effective date of such proposed rate or charge. This subsection shall not be applicable to any new price or method of pricing for a service presently being offered by any telecommunications company to its Missouri customers. Upon proposing a rate or charge for a telecommunications service which has not previously been provided by a telecommunications company to its Missouri customers, the offeror must file with the commission its justification for considering such offering a new service and such other information as may be required by rule or regulation, and must identify that service as being noncompetitive, transitionally competitive or competitive. If the offeror is a noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company and it proposes such service as a transitionally competitive or competitive telecommunications service, the telecommunications service shall be treated as a transitionally competitive telecommunications service until such time as the commission finally determines the appropriate classification. If the offeror is a competitive telecommunications company and it proposes such service as a competitive service, the competitive classification proposed by the offeror of the service shall apply until such time as the commission finally determines the appropriate classification. Such final determination by the commission of the appropriate classification of such service may be made by the commission after the end of the maximum thirty-day suspension period, but any such decision by the commission issued after the maximum thirty-day suspension period shall be prospective in nature. The commission shall expedite proceedings under this subsection in order to facilitate the rapid introduction of new telecommunications products and services into the marketplace.\n\n5. Unless the commission otherwise orders, any change in rates or charges, or change in any classification or tariff resulting in a change in rates or charges, for any telephone cooperative shall be filed, on an informational basis, with the commission at least thirty days prior to the date for implementation of such change. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as conferring jurisdiction upon the commission over the rates charged by a telephone cooperative for providing telecommunications service within an exchange or within a local calling scope as determined by the commission, except for exchange access service.\n\n6. If after notice and hearing, the commission determines that a telecommunications company has violated the requirements of section 392.200 or this section, it may revoke the certificate of service authority under which that telecommunications company operates and shall direct its general counsel to initiate an action under section 386.600 to recover penalties from such telecommunications company in an amount not to exceed the revenues received as a result of such violation multiplied by three or the gross jurisdictional operating revenues of that company for the preceding twelve months, the provisions of section 386.570 notwithstanding.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5665, A.L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 1988 S.B. 481, A.L. 1991 S.B. 269, A.L. 1993 S.B. 160, A.L. 1996 S.B. 507 merged with S.B. 630, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1779)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5209; 1919 § 10497\n\n(1958) Where telephone company serving a number of communities fixed its rates on a system-wide basis, a holding that city licenses or gross receipts taxes of some of the cities served should be collected from telephone users in cities which levied the taxes was reasonable.

No telecommunications company subject to the provisions of this chapter shall charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transmission of any interexchange telecommunications service offered or provided for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction, within this state, the shorter being included within the longer distance, or charge any greater compensation for a through interexchange telecommunications service than the aggregate of the intermediate rates or tolls subject to the provisions of this chapter; but this shall not be construed as authorizing any such telecommunications company to charge or receive as great a compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance.\n\n2. Upon application to the commission, a telecommunications company may, in special cases, after investigation, be authorized by the commission to charge less for a longer than for a shorter distance service for the transmission of messages or conversations, and the commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such telecommunications companies may be relieved from the operation and requirements of this section.\n\n3. Whenever there shall be filed with the commission by any telecommunications company, other than a small telephone company, any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, rental or charge, or any new individual or joint regulation or practice affecting any rate, rental or charge, the commission shall have, and it is hereby given, authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders without answer or other formal pleading by the interested telecommunications company or companies, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the propriety of such rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the commission, upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the telecommunications company affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice, but not for a longer period than sixty days beyond the time when such rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing, whether completed before or after the rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice goes into effect, the commission may make such order in reference to such rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after the rate, rental, charge, regulation or practice had become effective, however, if any such hearing cannot be concluded within the period of suspension, as above stated, the commission may, in its discretion, extend the time of suspension for a further period not exceeding ninety days.\n\n4.

At any hearing involving a rate increased or a rate sought to be increased after the passage of this law, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or proposed increased rate is just and reasonable shall be upon the telecommunications company, and the commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5671, A.L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1779)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5215; 1919 § 10503",

Companies to be regulated, when — maximum prices, determined how, changed how — classification — change of rates — nonwireless basic local telecommunications services, exempt from maximum allowable prices. —1. The commission shall have the authority to ensure that rates, charges, tolls and rentals for telecommunications services are just, reasonable and lawful by employing price cap regulation. Any rate, charge, toll, or rental that does not exceed the maximum allowable price under this section shall be deemed to be just, reasonable, and lawful. As used in this chapter,\"price cap regulation\"shall mean establishment of maximum allowable prices for telecommunications services offered by an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company, which maximum allowable prices shall not be subject to increase except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n2. A large incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall be subject to regulation under this section upon a determination by the commission that an alternative local exchange telecommunications company has been certified to provide basic local telecommunications service or an interconnected voice over internet protocol service provider has been registered to provide service under section 392.550, and is providing such service in any part of the large incumbent company's service area. A small incumbent local exchange telecommunications company may elect to be regulated under this section upon providing written notice to the commission if an alternative local exchange telecommunications company has been certified to provide basic local telecommunications service or an interconnected voice over internet protocol service provider has been registered to provide service under section 392.550, and is providing such service, or if two or more commercial mobile service providers providing wireless two-way voice communications services are providing services, in any part of the small incumbent company's service area, and the incumbent company shall remain subject to regulation under this section after such election.\n\n3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the maximum allowable prices established for a company under subsection 1 of this section shall be those in effect on December thirty-first of the year preceding the year in which the company is first subject to regulation under this section. Tariffs authorized under subsection 9 of this section shall be phased in as provided under such tariffs as approved by the commission.\n\n4. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 8 and 9 of this section and section 392.248, the maximum allowable prices for exchange access and basic local telecommunications services of a small, incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section shall not be changed for a period of twelve months after the date the company is subject to regulation under this section. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 8 and 9 of this section and section 392.248, the maximum allowable prices for exchange access and basic local telecommunications services of a large, incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section shall not be changed prior to January 1, 2000. Thereafter, the maximum allowable prices for exchange access and basic local telecommunications services of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall be annually changed by the following methods:\n\n(a) By the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as published by the United States Department of Commerce or its successor agency for the preceding twelve months; provided however, that if such a change in the CPI for the preceding twelve months is negative, upon request by the company and approval by the commission for good cause shown, the commission may waive any requirement to reduce prices of exchange access and basic local telecommunications service and those existing prices shall remain the maximum allowable prices for purposes of this section until the next annual change. All revenues that are attributable to a CPI reduction waiver shall be used for the purposes approved by the commission to benefit local exchange ratepayers in a specific exchange or exchanges, including but not limited to expanded local calling scopes;\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a finding that a company that is subject to price-cap regulation has telecommunications services in one or more exchanges classified as competitive, the company may increase the maximum allowable rate for basic local telecommunications service in noncompetitive exchanges at a level not to exceed the statewide average for basic local telecommunications service in the competitively classified exchanges of that company, provided that any annual increase in rates for residential basic local telecommunications service shall not exceed two dollars per line per month for a period of four years.\n\n(2) The commission shall approve a change to a maximum allowable price or make a determination regarding a request for waiver filed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection within forty-five days of filing of notice by the local exchange telecommunications company. An incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall file a tariff to reduce the rates charged for any service in any case in which the current rate exceeds the maximum allowable price established under this subsection.\n\n(3) An incumbent local exchange telecommunications company may change the rates for its services, consistent with the provisions of subsections 2 through 5 of section 392.200, but not to exceed the maximum allowable prices, by filing tariffs which shall be approved by the commission within ten days, provided that any such rate is not in excess of the maximum allowable price established for such service under this section.\n\n5. Each telecommunications service offered to business customers, other than exchange access service, of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section shall be classified as competitive in any exchange in which at least two nonaffiliated entities in addition to the incumbent local exchange company are providing basic local telecommunications service to business or residential customers within the exchange. Each telecommunications service offered to residential customers, other than exchange access service, of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section shall be classified as competitive in an exchange in which at least two nonaffiliated entities in addition to the incumbent local exchange company are providing basic local telecommunications service to residential customers within the exchange. For purposes of this subsection and not for purposes of defining the commission's jurisdiction:\n\n(1) Commercial mobile service providers as identified in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(d)(1) and 47 C.F.R. Parts 22 or 24 shall be considered as entities providing basic local telecommunications service, provided that only one such nonaffiliated provider shall be considered as providing basic local telecommunications service within an exchange. If the commercial mobile service provider does not designate customers by business or residential class, such provider will be deemed to be providing service to both business and residential customers;\n\n(2) Any entity providing local voice service in whole or in part over telecommunications facilities or other facilities in which it or one of its affiliates have an ownership interest shall be considered as providing basic local telecommunications service regardless of whether such entity is subject to regulation by the commission, including any interconnected voice over internet protocol service provider registered under section 392.550. A provider of local voice service that requires the use of a third party, unaffiliated broadband network or dial-up internet network for the origination of local voice service shall not be considered a basic local telecommunications service provider. For purposes of this subsection only, a\"broadband network\"is defined as a connection that delivers services at speeds exceeding two hundred kilobits per second in at least one direction;\n\n(3) Regardless of the technology utilized,\"local voice service\"shall mean two-way voice service capable of receiving calls from a provider of basic local telecommunications services as defined by subdivision (4) of section 386.020;\n\n(4) Telecommunications companies only offering prepaid telecommunications service or only reselling telecommunications service as defined in subdivision (54) of section 386.020 in the exchange being considered for competitive classification shall not be considered entities providing basic telecommunications service;\n\n(5)\"Prepaid telecommunications service\"shall mean a local service for which payment is made in advance that excludes access to operator assistance and long distance service;\n\n(6) Upon request of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company seeking competitive classification of its services under this subsection, the commission shall, within thirty days of the request, determine whether there are at least two entities providing basic local telecommunications service in an exchange and if so shall approve tariffs designating all such services other than exchange access service as competitive within such exchange. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, any incumbent local exchange company may petition the commission for competitive classification within an exchange based on competition from any entity providing local voice service in whole or in part by using its own telecommunications facilities or other facilities or the telecommunications facilities or other facilities of a third party, including those of the incumbent local exchange company as well as providers that rely on an unaffiliated third-party internet service. The commission shall approve such petition within sixty days. The commission shall maintain records of certified and registered providers of local voice service, including those providers who provide local voice service over their own facilities, or through the use of facilities of another provider of local voice service. In reviewing an incumbent local exchange telephone company's request for competitive status in an exchange, the commission shall consider their own records concerning ownership of facilities and shall make all inquiries as are necessary and appropriate from certified and registered providers of local voice service to determine the extent and presence of local voice providers in an exchange. If the services of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company are classified as competitive under this subsection, the local exchange telecommunications company may thereafter adjust its rates for such competitive services upward or downward as it determines appropriate in its competitive environment, upon filing tariffs which shall become effective within the time lines identified in section 392.500. The commission may not more than once every two years review those exchanges where an incumbent local exchange carrier's services have been classified as competitive, to determine if the conditions of this subsection for competitive classification continue to exist in the exchange and if the commission determines, after hearing, that such conditions no longer exist for the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company in such exchange, it shall reimpose upon the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company, in such exchange, the provisions of paragraph (c) of subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of section 392.200 and the new maximum allowable prices for basic local telecommunications service in such exchange shall be established by the provisions of subsection 4 of this section;\n\n(7) Upon a finding that fifty-five percent or more of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company's total subscriber access lines are in exchanges where such company's services have been declared competitive, the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall be deemed competitive and shall no longer be subject to price-cap regulation, except that rates charged for basic local telecommunications service in exchanges that were noncompetitive immediately prior to this finding can be increased to a rate that is no higher than the statewide average rate for basic local telecommunications service in the incumbent local exchange company's competitively classified exchanges for a period of four years. During the four year period, any annual increase in rates for residential basic local telecommunications service shall not exceed two dollars per line per month. Rates charged for exchange access service by an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company deemed competitive shall not exceed the rates charged at the time the company was deemed competitive;\n\n(8) An incumbent local exchange telecommunications company deemed competitive under this section and all alternative local exchange telecommunications companies shall not be required to comply with customer billing rules, network engineering and maintenance rules, and rules requiring the recording and submitting of service objectives or surveillance levels established by the commission, but shall be subject to commission authority to hear and resolve customer complaints to the extent the customer complaint is based on Truth-in-Billing regulations established by the Federal Communications Commission, or network engineering and maintenance standards established within the National Electric Safety Code. In addition, the commission shall continue to have authority to hear and resolve customer complaints to the extent such complaints are based on a failure to comply with the provisions of applicable tariffs, or a failure to comply with the rules of the commission other than those rules related to customer billing, network engineering and maintenance, and service objectives and surveillance levels or a failure to provide service in a manner that is safe, adequate, usual and customary in the telecommunications industry;\n\n(9) The commission may reimpose its customer billing rules, network engineering and maintenance rules, and rules requiring the recording and submitting of service objectives or surveillance levels, as applicable, on an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company that has been deemed competitive under this section, only upon a finding that the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company has engaged in a pattern or practice of inadequate service in these subject areas and that the reimposition of such rules is necessary to ensure the protection of consumer rights and/or the public safety. Prior to formal notice and hearing, the commission shall notify the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company of any deficiencies and provide such company an opportunity to remedy such deficiencies in a reasonable amount of time, but not less than sixty days. Should the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company remedy such deficiencies within a reasonable amount of time, the commission shall not reimpose the applicable customer billing rules, network engineering and maintenance rules, and rules requiring the recording and submitting of service objectives or surveillance levels. Should the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company fail to remedy such deficiencies, the commission shall reimpose the applicable customer billing rules, network engineering and maintenance rules, and rules requiring the recording and submitting of service objectives or surveillance levels, if it finds that:\n\n(a) The reimposition of such rules is necessary for the protection of the majority of the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company's customers or for the public safety;\n\n(b) No alternative or less burdensome action is adequate to protect the majority of the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company's customers; and\n\n(c) Competitive market forces have been and will continue to be insufficient to protect the majority of the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company's customers;\n\n(10) Should the commission determine that an emergency exists that impacts public safety or is essential for the protection of a majority of customers of all local exchange telecommunications companies operating in this state, the commission may, on an emergency basis, impose its customer billing rules, network engineering and maintenance rules, and rules requiring the recording and submitting of service objectives or surveillance levels, as applicable, on all local exchange telecommunications companies on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis through the promulgation of emergency rules pursuant to section 536.025. The commission shall only promulgate such emergency rules after determining that:\n\n(a) The rules are essential for the protection of a majority of customers of local exchange telecommunications companies operating in this state;\n\n(b) No alternative or less burdensome mechanism will suffice to protect the majority of customers of local exchange telecommunications companies operating in this state; and\n\n(c) Competitive market forces have been and will continue to be insufficient to protect the majority of customers of local exchange telecommunications companies operating in this state.­­Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 7 of section 536.025, emergency rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to this subdivision shall remain in effect until the legislature concludes its next regular legislative session following the imposition of any such rules.\n\n­­Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 7 of section 536.025, emergency rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to this subdivision shall remain in effect until the legislature concludes its next regular legislative session following the imposition of any such rules.\n\n6. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to alter the commission's jurisdiction over quality and conditions of noncompetitive telecommunications services or to relieve noncompetitive telecommunications companies from the obligation to comply with commission rules relating to minimum basic local and interexchange telecommunications service.\n\n7. A company regulated under this section shall not be subject to regulation under subsection 1 of section 392.240.\n\n8. An incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section may reduce intrastate access rates, including carrier common line charges, subject to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section, to a level not to exceed one hundred fifty percent of the company's interstate rates for similar access services in effect as of December thirty-first of the year preceding the year in which the company first exercises its option to rebalance rates under this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company from establishing its intrastate access rates at a level lower than one hundred fifty percent of the company's interstate rates for similar access services in effect as of December thirty-first of the year preceding the year in which the company first exercises its option to rebalance rates under this subsection.\n\n9. Other provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the commission shall allow an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section which reduces its intrastate access service rates pursuant to subsection 8 of this section to offset the annual revenue loss resulting from its access service rate reduction by increasing each year its monthly maximum allowable prices applicable to basic local exchange telecommunications services by an amount not to exceed one dollar fifty cents. A large incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall not increase its monthly rates applicable to basic local telecommunications service under this subsection unless it also reduces its rates for intraLATA interexchange telecommunications services by at least ten percent in the year it first exercises its option to rebalance rates under subsection 8 of this section. The total annual revenue increase due to the increase to the monthly maximum allowable prices for basic local telecommunications service shall not exceed the total annual revenue loss resulting from the reduction to intrastate access service rates.\n\n10. Any telecommunications company whose intrastate access costs are reduced pursuant to subsections 8 and 9 of this section shall decrease its rates for intrastate toll telecommunications service to flow through such reduced costs to its customers. The commission may permit a telecommunications company to defer a rate reduction required by this subdivision until such reductions, on a cumulative basis, reach a level that is practical to flow through to its customers.\n\n11. All nonbasic telecommunications services of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company that is subject to price-cap regulation shall be exempt from limitations on maximum allowable prices.\n\n12. The commission shall permit an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company regulated under this section to determine and set its own depreciation rates which shall be used for all intrastate regulatory purposes. Provided, however, that such a determination is not binding on the commission in determining eligibility for or reimbursement under the universal service fund established under section 392.248.\n\n13. Prior to January 1, 2006, the commission shall determine the weighted, statewide average rate of nonwireless basic local telecommunications services as of August 28, 2005. The commission shall likewise determine the weighted, statewide average rate of nonwireless basic local telecommunications services two years and five years after August 28, 2005. The commission shall report its findings to the general assembly by January 30, 2008, and provide a second study by January 30, 2011. If the commission finds that the weighted, statewide average rate of nonwireless basic local telecommunications service in 2008 or 2011 is greater than the weighted, statewide average rate of nonwireless basic local telecommunications service in 2006 multiplied by one plus the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all goods and services for the study periods, the commission shall recommend to the general assembly such changes in state law as the commission deems appropriate to achieve the purposes set forth in section 392.185. In determining the weighted, statewide average rate of nonwireless basic local telecommunications service, the commission shall exclude rate increases to nonwireless basic telecommunications service permitted under subsections 8 and 9 of this section and section 392.240 or exogenous costs incurred by the providers of nonwireless basic local telecommunications service.\n\n(L. 1996 S.B. 507, A.L. 2005 S.B. 237, A.L. 2006 S.B. 1066, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1779)",

Universal service board created, purpose, powers, duties, members — assessment, failure to pay, penalty — eligibility for funding — carriers of last resort — commission's duties — limited liability. —1. In order to ensure just, reasonable, and affordable rates for reasonably comparable essential local telecommunications services throughout the state, there is hereby established the \"Universal Service Board\" which shall consist of the members of the public service commission and the public counsel, and which shall be incorporated as a not-for-profit, public benefit corporation in the manner provided pursuant to chapter 355, except as otherwise provided in this section. Consistent with rules adopted by the commission, the universal service board shall create a universal service fund. The universal service board shall supervise the management of the universal service fund. Funds deposited in the universal service fund are not state funds. The commission shall adopt rules governing the operations of the state universal service fund within three months of the adoption of the rules adopted by the Federal Communication Commission for the federal Universal Service Fund. Nothing in the rules adopted by the commission shall be inconsistent with the support mechanisms established for the federal Universal Service Fund, but the commission may adopt any additional definitions and standards it believes are necessary to preserve and advance universal service in the state of Missouri. The commission shall adopt rules governing the operations of the universal service fund and the operation of the universal service board. Meetings of the universal service board shall be open meetings pursuant to chapter 610. The universal service board shall also retain an independent neutral fund administrator who will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the universal service fund. The fund administrator shall be a fiduciary with trust company powers. The universal service board shall provide for periodic review of the fund administrator and the opportunity for selection of an alternate fund administrator no less frequently than every four years. The agency, individual, firm, partnership, or corporation that is selected by the commission as the neutral administrator of the universal service fund may neither contribute to nor receive disbursements from the universal service fund, except as provided in subsection 2 of this section. The administrator may not have any financial interest in a telecommunications company, as defined in section 386.020. The commission shall cause the books and records of the universal service fund administrator to be independently audited on an annual basis. The independent audit shall be paid for from funds held in the universal service fund.\n\n2. The commission shall adopt and enforce rules to be implemented by the universal service board, governing the system of funding and disbursing funds from the universal service fund in a manner that does not grant a preference or competitive advantage to any telecommunications company or subject a telecommunications company to prejudice or disadvantage. Funds from the universal service fund shall only be used:\n\n(1) To ensure the provision of reasonably comparable essential local telecommunications service, as that definition may be updated by the commission by rule, throughout the state including high-cost areas, at just, reasonable and affordable rates;\n\n(2) To assist low-income customers and disabled customers in obtaining affordable essential telecommunications services; and\n\n(3) To pay the reasonable, audited costs of administering the universal service fund.\n\n3. The universal service fund shall be funded through assessments on all telecommunications companies in the state which shall be based on Missouri jurisdictional telecommunications services revenue and other nondiscriminatory factors as determined by the commission. Such assessments shall be paid to the universal service board. A telecommunications company regulated under section 392.245 may, upon providing written notice to the commission, increase the maximum allowable prices for any or all of its telecommunications services except residential basic local telecommunications services above those maximum allowable prices otherwise established in section 392.245 by an amount not to exceed the amount required to recover fifty percent of its assessment under this section. Any increases in the maximum allowable prices for exchange access and basic local telecommunications services other than residential basic local telecommunications services shall be calculated to recover revenues in the same percentage as the revenues from such services bear to such company's total revenues for nonbasic, exchange access and basic local other than residential telecommunications services for the preceding twelve months. A telecommunications company regulated under section 392.245 may seek to have the remaining fifty percent of its assessment under this section included in its funding requirements under this section. The commission shall establish the level of the universal service fund funding requirement necessary to fund the purposes set forth in subsection 2 of this section. The universal service fund funding requirements shall be paid by the universal service board in accordance with procedures approved by the commission. A telecommunications company that fails to pay an assessment that is due and payable pursuant to this section may have its certificate revoked or be required to pay appropriate penalties under chapter 386 after notice and hearing.\n\n4. To facilitate provision of essential local telecommunications service, the commission shall determine whether and to what extent any telecommunications company in the state providing essential local telecommunications service in any part of the state, shall be eligible to receive funding. Eligibility shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) A telecommunications company's eligibility to receive support for high-cost areas from the universal service fund shall be conditioned upon:\n\n(a) The telecommunications company offering essential local telecommunications service, using its own facilities, in whole or in part, throughout an entire high-cost area and having carrier of last resort obligations in that high-cost area; and\n\n(b) The telecommunications company charging a rate not in excess of that set by the commission for essential services in a particular geographic area; and\n\n(2) A telecommunications company's eligibility to receive support to assist low-income customers and disabled customers shall be conditioned on the company's providing essential local telecommunications services to such customers pursuant to the discounted rate established by the commission for such customers. Distributions from the universal service fund shall be made by the universal service board in accordance with rules approved by the commission.\n\n5. In local exchange areas subject to competition for essential local telecommunications service, the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall be designated as a carrier of last resort for essential local telecommunications service. The commission may, consistent with section 214(e)(2) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, after notice and hearing, designate one or more additional carriers of last resort for any exchange or other area designated by the commission upon a finding that such designation is in the public interest. In exchanges where the commission has designated more than one carrier of last resort, the commission may permit a local exchange telecommunications company to relinquish such obligation, consistent with section 214(e)(4) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, upon a finding that at least one carrier of last resort will continue to serve that area. In local exchange areas not subject to competition for essential local telecommunications service, the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company shall continue to act as the carrier of last resort.\n\n6. In determining whether, and to what extent, universal service fund funding is required to facilitate provision of essential local telecommunications service, the commission shall:\n\n(1) Determine the definition of essential local telecommunications service no later than three months after the adoption of the essential local exchange telecommunications service definition for the federal Universal Service Fund, and consider revision of the definition on a periodic basis not to exceed every three years thereafter, with the goal that every citizen of this state shall have access to a wider range of services, that are reasonably comparable between urban and rural areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable between urban and rural areas;\n\n(2) Upon request from an eligible telecommunications company for assistance from the universal service fund for a high-cost area, determine if the high-cost area qualifies for assistance from the universal service fund. The commission shall review its determination that a high-cost area qualifies for assistance from the universal service fund no less frequently than once every five years;\n\n(3) Determine for each requesting, eligible local exchange telecommunications company, by high-cost area, the costs of providing essential local telecommunications services in those high-cost areas and establish support payments necessary to such companies to ensure just, reasonable and affordable rates for essential telecommunications service. The commission shall review such support payments no less frequently than once every five years; provided, however, that if the commission adopts a different definition of essential local telecommunications service, pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, then the commission shall review and adjust accordingly the previously authorized support payments in order to ensure just, reasonable and affordable rates for essential telecommunications service, as revised by commission rule. In determining and reviewing such support payments, the commission shall ensure that no telecommunications company receives more or less support than necessary to further the purposes established in subsection 2 of this section;\n\n(4) Establish a standard to determine whether and to what extent particular end-user customers, without regard to location within the state, may be eligible for assistance in paying for essential local telecommunications service.\n\n7. The commission shall arrange for the time and place for the initial organizational meeting of the universal service board.\n\n8. The universal service board shall submit to the commission a plan of operation. After notice and hearing, the commission shall approve the plan of operation, provided that it does not grant a preference or competitive advantage to any telecommunications company or subject a telecommunications company to prejudice or disadvantage. In its plan, the universal service board shall establish procedures for the handling and accounting of assets and establish procedures for the collection of assessments from all telecommunications companies to provide for universal service payments and for administrative expenses.\n\n9. The universal service board shall have authority to:\n\n(1) Enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions of this section; and\n\n(2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper for recovery of any assessments.\n\n10. No member of the universal service board shall be civilly liable, either jointly or separately, as a result of any act, omission or decision in performance of the member's duties as specifically required by this section. Such immunity shall not attach for any intentional or reckless act affecting the property or rights of any person.\n\n11. Nothing in this section shall require the commission, the universal service board, the universal service fund administrator, or any other person or agency to take any actions that are inconsistent with federal statutes, administrative rules, or court decisions concerning provision of essential local telecommunications service.\n\n12. The commission and the universal service board may do all things necessary and convenient to implement and administer the universal service fund.\n\n13. In the event of a Federal Communications Commission order, rule or policy announced no later than December 31, 1997, pursuant to section 254(a)(2) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the effect of which is to change the federal Universal Service Fund revenues of an incumbent local exchange telecommunications company, the commission shall either increase the maximum allowable prices for basic local telecommunications service or increase the company's recovery from the state universal service fund or a combination thereof to replace the reasonably projected change in revenues. The commission shall review the continuing need for such revenues in its periodic reviews pursuant to subdivision (3)*of subsection 6 of this section.\n\n(L. 1996 S.B. 507)\n\n*Original rolls contain \"subdivision 3 of subsection 6\".",

The commission shall have power, after hearing, to require any or all telecommunications companies to carry a proper and adequate depreciation account in accordance with such rules and regulations and in the forms of account as the commission shall prescribe. The commission may, from time to time on its own motion or upon the application of the telecommunications company or the office of the public counsel, ascertain and determine and by order fix the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of such public utility. Each telecommunications company shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained, determined and fixed. Upon filing the application for a change in depreciation rates, the applicant must file with the commission all information in justification of the depreciation rate changes. The commission shall rule upon any request for a change in depreciation rates within twelve months of such request, unless a general rate proceeding is pending at the time set for decision, in which case the commission may rule upon the request for a change in depreciation rates at the same time it rules upon the general rate case proceeding.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, a telecommunications company may request the commission to authorize minimum depreciation rates in lieu of fixed rates, and to record depreciation expense on the basis of depreciation rates in excess of such minimum rates. The reasonableness of any request for an increase in the tariffed rates for noncompetitive telecommunications service shall be considered on the basis of the minimum authorized depreciation rates, and the depreciation expense attributed to any test period shall be calculated on the basis of the company's minimum depreciation rates regardless of the depreciation expense actually recorded by the telecommunications company. Where minimum depreciation rates have been authorized pursuant to this subsection, the commission may prescribe new minimum depreciation rates in a general rate proceeding and use those new minimum depreciation rates to determine the reasonableness of tariffed rates for telecommunications service in that general rate proceeding. In any proceeding to consider a request for an increase in the tariffed rates for telecommunications service, the telecommunications company shall utilize for the purposes of such proceeding the depreciation reserve levels which have occurred on the basis of the recorded depreciation expenses.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5680, A.L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 1993 S.B. 160)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5224; 1919 § 10512",

Classification of telecommunications company, services — procedure — effect of classification. —1. As an alternative to the provisions of section 392.245, a telecommunications company, including price-cap regulated companies, may file with the commission a petition to be classified as a competitive telecommunications company or a transitionally competitive telecommunications company under this section, or to have services classified as competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications services under this section.\n\n2. The commission shall serve by regular mail a copy of any petition or motion filed under subsection l of this section on all telecommunications companies that have applied for authority to provide or are authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications service within this state. In response to a petition filed, the commission shall afford all interested persons reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard to determine whether a telecommunications company or service may be subject to sufficient competition to justify a lesser degree of regulation. In making this determination, the commission shall, within nine months of the filing of the petition under this section, consider all relevant factors and shall issue written findings of fact delineating all factors considered. In any hearing involving the same telecommunications service or company, the commission may, if appropriate and if no new finding of fact is required, rely on a finding of fact made in a prior hearing.\n\n3. The commission may classify a telecommunications company as a competitive telecommunications company upon a finding that a majority of its telecommunications services offered by such company are competitive telecommunications services.\n\n4. If, after following the procedures required under subsection 2 of this section, the commission determines that a telecommunications service is subject to sufficient competition to justify a lesser degree of regulation and that such lesser regulation is consistent with the protection of ratepayers and promotes the public interest it may, by order, classify:\n\n(1) The subject telecommunications service offered by a telecommunications company as a competitive telecommunications service;\n\n(2) The subject telecommunications service offered by a noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company as a transitionally competitive telecommunications service;\n\n(3) The subject telecommunications company, subject to the condition set forth in subsection 3 of this section, as a competitive telecommunications company; or\n\n(4) The subject interexchange telecommunications company as a transitionally competitive telecommunications company.\n\n5. By its order classifying a telecommunications service as competitive or transitionally competitive or a telecommunications company as competitive or transitionally competitive, the commission may, with respect to that service or company and with respect to one or more providers of that service, suspend or modify the application of its rules or the application of any statutory provision contained in sections 392.200 to 392.340, except as provided in section 392.390.\n\n6. If the commission suspends the application of a statutory requirement under this section, it may require a telecommunications company to comply with any conditions reasonably made necessary to protect the public interest by the suspension of the statutory requirement. The exchange access rates of an incumbent local exchange company that is declared a competitive telecommunications company shall not exceed the rates that were charged at the time the company became a competitive telecommunications company. The exchange access rates of an alternative local exchange company shall not exceed the exchange access rates of the incumbent local exchange company against whom the alternative local exchange company is competing.\n\n7. A telecommunications company may file a petition to have a telecommunications service it then offers classified as competitive or transitionally competitive under this section no more than once every two years, unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated. A telecommunications company shall consolidate in a single petition all telecommunications services the company then offers which it seeks to classify as competitive or transitionally competitive within two years from the date such petition is filed, unless the commission determines, for good cause shown, that a waiver of this provision should be granted.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of section 392.245, intrastate operator and directory services, including directory assistance services, shall be deemed competitive on a statewide basis for all local exchange telecommunications companies.\n\n(L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 1993 S.B. 160, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1779)",

In permitting, approving, investigating or establishing rates, charges, classifications or tariffs for noncompetitive telecommunications services, the commission shall not allow or establish rates, charges, classifications or tariffs for noncompetitive services which in any way, directly or indirectly, recover the expenses, investment, incremental risk or increased cost of capital associated with the provision of competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications services.\n\n2. The commission shall, after hearing, by rule or order, establish procedures, including but not limited to accounting procedures, to be followed by all noncompetitive and transitionally competitive telecommunications companies which assist in implementing the prohibition contained in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. The commission shall establish, after hearing, by rule or order, appropriate methods for calculating the costs of providing any telecommunications service offered by a noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company and for determining whether the rates or charges for such telecommunications service are at a level equal to or greater than such cost. The commission may order any noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company to conduct a cost study and to provide the results thereof to the commission.

Should the commission consider revenues from a competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications service in setting just and reasonable rates for noncompetitive telecommunications service offered or provided by a noncompetitive local exchange telecommunications company, the commission shall also consider all expenses, investment, and revenues associated with the offering or provision of all competitive and transitionally competitive telecommunications services offered or provided by such telecommunications company unless the consideration of the expenses, investment, and revenues associated with the offering or provision of a particular competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications service is otherwise prohibited by law, or the commission in its original order classifying a telecommunications service as competitive or transitionally competitive, finds that it is not in the interest of customers of noncompetitive telecommunications services for the expenses, investment, and revenues associated with a particular competitive service or transitionally competitive telecommunications service to be taken into account in setting just and reasonable rates for noncompetitive telecommunications service. If the commission finds that it is not in the interest of customers of noncompetitive telecommunications services for the expenses, investment, and revenues associated with a particular competitive service or transitionally competitive telecommunications service to be taken into account in setting just and reasonable rates for noncompetitive telecommunications service, then the noncompetitive local exchange telecommunications company shall have the option of not offering or providing that particular competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications service.\n\n5. It shall be unjust, unreasonable, and unlawful for a noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company to offer or provide a competitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications service below the cost of such service as determined by the commission if the commission finds that such offering or provision of service constitutes conduct which is not consistent with the promotion of full and fair competition.\n\n6. A telecommunications company may file a complaint as to the reasonableness or lawfulness of any rate or charge for service offered or provided by a noncompetitive or transitionally competitive telecommunications company.

In addition, the commission shall adopt such rules, consistent with section 253(b) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 to preserve and advance universal service, protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers. Such rules, at a minimum, shall require that all applicants seeking a certificate to provide basic local telecommunications services under this section:\n\n(1) File and maintain tariffs with the commission in the same manner and form as the commission requires of the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company with which the applicant seeks to compete; and\n\n(2) Meet the minimum service standards as the commission requires of the incumbent local exchange telecommunications company with which the applicant seeks to compete.\n\n3.

No telecommunications company authorized by the commission to provide or offer basic local or basic interexchange telecommunications service within the state of Missouri on January 1, 1984, shall abandon such service until and unless it shall demonstrate, and the commission finds, after notice and hearing, that such abandonment will not deprive any customers of basic local or basic interexchange telecommunications service or access to local voice service and is not otherwise contrary to the public interest.\n\n3. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter or chapter 386, a local exchange carrier obligated under this section to serve as the carrier of last resort in greenfield areas shall automatically be relieved of such obligation and shall not be obligated to provide basic local voice service or any telecommunications service to any occupants of real property if the owner or developer of the real property, or a person acting on behalf of the owner or developer of real property, engages in any of the following acts:\n\n(1) Permits an alternative service provider to install its facilities or equipment used to provide local voice services based on a condition of exclusion of the local exchange carrier during the construction phase of the real property;\n\n(2) Accepts or agrees to accept incentives or rewards from an alternative service provider that are contingent upon the provision of any or all local voice services by one or more alternative service providers to the exclusion of the local exchange carrier; or\n\n(3) Collects from the occupants or residents of the real property mandatory charges for the provision of any local voice service provided by an alternative service provider to the occupants or residents in any manner, including, but not limited to, collection through rent, fees, or dues.\n\n4. The local exchange carrier relieved of its carrier of last resort obligation to provide basic local telecommunications service to the occupants of real property under subsection 3 of this section shall notify the commission in writing of that fact within one hundred twenty days after receiving knowledge of the existence of such fact.\n\n5. A local exchange carrier that is not relieved of its carrier of last resort obligation under subsections 2 and 3 of this section may seek a waiver of its carrier of last resort obligation from the commission for good cause shown based on the facts and circumstances of the provision of local voice service or internet access services or video services to a particular real property. Upon petition for such relief, notice shall be given by the local exchange carrier at the same time to the relevant owner or developer. The commission shall make a determination concerning the petition on or before ninety days after such petition is filed, unless the commission determines that good cause exists to delay the determination for an additional ninety days and that such delay is not likely to have a materially adverse effect upon consumers of telecommunications services.\n\n6. If a local exchange carrier is relieved of its carrier of last resort obligation under subsection 3 or 5 of this section, the owner or developer shall notify all occupants and any subsequent owner of the specific real property of the following:\n\n(1) That the incumbent local exchange carrier does not have facilities installed to serve the specific real property, and that such carrier has been relieved of its carrier of last resort obligations; and\n\n(2) The name of the person that will be providing local telecommunications service to the real property, and the type of technology that will be used to provide such service.\n\n7.

The local exchange carrier shall provide notice to the commission that it is assuming the carrier of last resort obligation. The local exchange carrier may require that the owner or developer pay the local exchange carrier in advance a reasonable fee to recover costs that exceed the costs that would have been incurred to construct or acquire facilities to serve customers at the real property initially. The commission may verify that the fee enables the local exchange carrier to recover its costs that exceed the costs that would have been incurred to construct or acquire facilities to serve customers at the real property initially, including, but not limited to, amounts necessary to install or retrofit any facilities or equipment, to cut or trench sidewalks and streets, and to restore roads, sidewalks, block walls, or landscapes to original conditions.

When real property is located in a greenfield area, a carrier of last resort shall not automatically be excused from its obligations under subsection 3 of this section unless the alternative service provider possesses or will possess at the time of commencement of service the capability to provide local voice service or the functional equivalent of such service through any form of technology.\n\n9. If an owner or developer of real property permits an alternative service provider to install its facilities or equipment used to provide local voice service to such property based on a condition of exclusion of the local exchange carrier, the owner or developer shall provide written notice to the purchaser of any such real property that there is an exclusion of that local exchange carrier and that the alternative service provider is the exclusive provider of service to such property.\n\n10. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall have the right to require a payment from an owner or developer in cases where the costs of extending facilities to serve a multitenant business or residential property, including, but not limited to, apartments, condominiums, subdivisions, office buildings, or office parks are not economically reasonable. The terms and conditions applicable to such payments shall be specified in the incumbent local exchange carrier's tariffs. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall not be obligated to provide local voice service or any other telecommunications service without payment specified in the incumbent local exchange carrier's tariff.\n\n11. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter or chapter 386, a telecommunications company may meet its carrier of last resort obligations and its obligations to provide or offer basic local or basic interexchange telecommunications service by providing local voice service using any technology. If a telecommunications company uses a wireless technology, such company shall meet such obligations by using a technology that provides 911 caller location technology that meets or exceeds wireless Phase II enhanced 911 rules requirements, as adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n12. Any local exchange carrier relieved of its carrier of last resort obligation in a particular area under subsection 3 or 5 of this section shall not be deemed to have lost its general designation as carrier of last resort for essential local telecommunications service outside that area for purposes of subsection 5 of section 392.248.\n\n13. When a local exchange carrier is relieved of the carrier of last resort obligation to serve in a designated area, in no instance shall the carrier of last resort obligation be transferred to any alternative service provider or provider of local voice service, including interconnected voice over internet protocol service in that designated service area.\n\n14. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter or chapter 386, any telecommunications company may, upon notice to the commission, elect to no longer be designated as a carrier of last resort for any telecommunications service within any county with a charter form of government and with more than eight hundred thousand inhabitants*, any city not within a county, and the portion of any home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county that is located in any county with a charter form of government and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer than seven hundred thousand inhabitants. Upon such election, a telecommunications company shall not be required to provide or offer basic local or basic interexchange telecommunications service and may provide local voice service using any technology.\n\n15. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other law to the contrary, no telecommunications company shall receive state high-cost universal service fund support in a high-cost area as described under section 392.248 for any area where such company has been relieved of its carrier of last resort obligation under this section; however, such company shall not be ineligible to receive state high-cost universal service fund support in other areas where it retains the carrier of last resort obligation.\n\n(L. 1987 H.B. 360, A.L. 2011 H.B. 339)\n\n*Revisor's Note: The county description contained in this section is not consistent with any official county description in effect at the time of passage based on the requirements of section 1.100.",
