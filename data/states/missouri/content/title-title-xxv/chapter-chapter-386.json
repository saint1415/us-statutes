Rate schedules for interim energy charges or periodic rate adjustment — application for approval, procedure — adjustment mechanisms — rulemaking authority — task force to be appointed — surveillance monitoring, requirements. —1. Subject to the requirements of this section, any electrical corporation may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing an interim energy charge, or periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to reflect increases and decreases in its prudently incurred fuel and purchased-power costs, including transportation. The commission may, in accordance with existing law, include in such rate schedules features designed to provide the electrical corporation with incentives to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its fuel and purchased-power procurement activities.\n\n2. Subject to the requirements of this section, any electrical, gas, or water corporation may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to reflect increases and decreases in its prudently incurred costs, whether capital or expense, to comply with any federal, state, or local environmental law, regulation, or rule. Any rate adjustment made under such rate schedules shall not exceed an annual amount equal to two and one-half percent of the electrical, gas, or water corporation's Missouri gross jurisdictional revenues, excluding gross receipts tax, sales tax and other similar pass-through taxes not included in tariffed rates, for regulated services as established in the utility's most recent general rate case or complaint proceeding. In addition to the rate adjustment, the electrical, gas, or water corporation shall be permitted to collect any applicable gross receipts tax, sales tax, or other similar pass-through taxes, and such taxes shall not be counted against the two and one-half percent rate adjustment cap. Any costs not recovered as a result of the annual two and one-half percent limitation on rate adjustments may be deferred, at a carrying cost each month equal to the utilities net of tax cost of capital, for recovery in a subsequent year or in the corporation's next general rate case or complaint proceeding.\n\n*3. Subject to the requirements of this section, any gas or electrical corporation may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to adjust rates of customers in eligible customer classes to account for the impact on utility revenues of increases or decreases in residential and commercial customer usage due to variations in either weather, conservation, or both. For purposes of this section: for electrical corporations,\"eligible customer classes\"means the residential class and classes that are not demand metered; and for gas corporations,\"eligible customer classes\"means the residential class and the smallest general service class. As used in this subsection,\"revenues\"means the revenues recovered through base rates, and does not include revenues collected through a rate adjustment mechanism authorized by this section or any other provisions of law. This subsection shall apply to electrical corporations beginning January 1, 2019, and shall expire for electrical corporations on January 1, 2029. An electrical corporation may make a one-time application to the commission under this subsection if such corporation has provided notice to the commission under subsection 5 of section 393.1400, provided the corporation shall not concurrently utilize electric rate adjustments under this subsection and the deferrals set forth in subsection 5 of section 393.1400.\n\n4. Subject to the requirements of this section, a water corporation with more than eight thousand Missouri retail customers may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to ensure revenues billed by such water corporation for regulated services equal the revenue requirement for regulated services as established in the water corporation's most recent general rate proceeding or complaint proceeding, excluding any other commission-approved surcharges and gross receipts tax, sales tax, and other similar pass-through taxes not included in tariffed rates, due to any revenue variation resulting from increases or decreases in residential, commercial, public authority, and sale for resale usage.\n\n5. The commission shall have the power to approve, modify, or reject adjustment mechanisms submitted under subsections 1 to 4 of this section only after providing the opportunity for a full hearing in a general rate proceeding, including a general rate proceeding initiated by complaint. The commission may approve such rate schedules after considering all relevant factors which may affect the costs or overall rates and charges of the corporation, provided that it finds that the adjustment mechanism set forth in the schedules:\n\n(1) Is reasonably designed to provide the utility with a sufficient opportunity to earn a fair return on equity;\n\n(2) Includes provisions for an annual true-up which shall accurately and appropriately remedy any over- or under-collections, including interest at the utility's short-term borrowing rate, through subsequent rate adjustments or refunds;\n\n(3) In the case of an adjustment mechanism submitted under subsections 1 and 2 of this section, includes provisions requiring that the utility file a general rate case with the effective date of new rates to be no later than four years after the effective date of the commission order implementing the adjustment mechanism. However, with respect to each mechanism, the four-year period shall not include any periods in which the utility is prohibited from collecting any charges under the adjustment mechanism, or any period for which charges collected under the adjustment mechanism must be fully refunded. In the event a court determines that the adjustment mechanism is unlawful and all moneys collected thereunder are fully refunded, the utility shall be relieved of any obligation under that adjustment mechanism to file a rate case;\n\n(4) In the case of an adjustment mechanism submitted under subsection 1 or 2 of this section, includes provisions for prudence reviews of the costs subject to the adjustment mechanism no less frequently than at eighteen-month intervals, and shall require refund of any imprudently incurred costs plus interest at the utility's short-term borrowing rate.\n\n6. Once such an adjustment mechanism is approved by the commission under this section, it shall remain in effect until such time as the commission authorizes the modification, extension, or discontinuance of the mechanism in a general rate case or complaint proceeding.\n\n7. Any amounts charged under any adjustment mechanism approved by the commission under this section shall be separately disclosed on each customer bill.\n\n8. The commission may take into account any change in business risk to the corporation resulting from implementation of the adjustment mechanism in setting the corporation's allowed return in any rate proceeding, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the corporation.\n\n9. In the event the commission lawfully approves an incentive- or performance-based plan, such plan shall be binding on the commission for the entire term of the plan. This subsection shall not be construed to authorize or prohibit any incentive- or performance-based plan.\n\n10. Prior to August 28, 2005, for subsections 1 to 3 of this section, and upon August 28, 2018, for subsection 4 of this section, the commission shall have the authority to promulgate rules under the provisions of chapter 536 as it deems necessary, to govern the structure, content and operation of such rate adjustments, and the procedure for the submission, frequency, examination, hearing and approval of such rate adjustments. Any electrical, gas, or water corporation may apply for any adjustment mechanism under this section whether or not the commission has promulgated any such rules.\n\n11. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as affecting any existing adjustment mechanism, rate schedule, tariff, incentive plan, or other ratemaking mechanism currently approved and in effect.\n\n12. Each of the provisions of this section is severable. In the event any provision or subsection of this section is deemed unlawful, all remaining provisions shall remain in effect.\n\n13. The provisions of subsections 1 to 3 of this section shall take effect on January 1, 2006, and the commission shall have previously promulgated rules to implement the application process for any rate adjustment mechanism under subsections 1 to 3 of this section prior to the commission issuing an order for any such rate adjustment.\n\n14. The public service commission shall appoint a task force, consisting of all interested parties, to study and make recommendations on the cost recovery and implementation of conservation and weatherization programs for electrical and gas corporations.\n\n**15. (1) Each public utility operating under a mechanism proposed and approved under subsection 3 of this section shall quarterly file a surveillance monitoring, consisting of five parts. Each part, except the rate-base quantifications report, shall contain information for the last twelve-month period and the last quarter data for total company electric operations and Missouri jurisdictional operations. Rate-base quantifications shall contain only information for the ending date of the period being reported.\n\n(2) Part one of the surveillance monitoring report shall be the rate-base quantifications report. The quantification of rate-base items in part one shall be consistent with the methods or procedures used in the most recent rate proceeding unless otherwise specified.

The commission may, of its own motion, investigate or make inquiry, in a manner to be determined by it, as to any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any telecommunications company subject to its supervision, and the commission shall make such inquiry in regard to any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any such public utility, person or corporation in violation of any provision of law or in violation of any order or decision of the commission.\n\n2. Complaints may be made to the commission by the public counsel or any person or corporation aggrieved, by petition or complaint, in writing, setting forth any thing or act done or omitted to be done by any telecommunications company in violation, or claimed to be in violation, of any provision of law or of the terms and conditions of its franchise or charter or of any order or decision of the commission. Upon the presentation of such a complaint the commission shall cause a copy thereof to be forwarded to the public utility, person or corporation complained of, which may be accompanied by an order, directed to such public utility, person or corporation, requiring that the matters complained of be satisfied, or that the charges be answered in writing within a time to be specified by the commission. If the public utility, person or corporation complained of shall make reparation for any injury alleged and shall cease to commit, or to permit, the violation of law, franchise, order or decision charged in the complaint, and shall notify the commission of that fact before the time allowed for answer, the commission need take no further action on the charges. If, however, the charges contained in such petition be not thus satisfied, and it shall appear to the commission that there are reasonable grounds therefor, it shall investigate such charges in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper, and take such action within its powers as the facts justify.\n\n3. Whenever the commission shall investigate any matter complained of by the public counsel or by any person or corporation aggrieved by any act or omission of a telecommunications company under this section, it shall be its duty, within sixty days after final submission, to make and file an order either dismissing the petition or complaint or directing the public utility, person or corporation complained of to satisfy the cause of complaint in whole or to the extent which the commission may specify and require.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the power of the commission over telecommunications companies, the commission shall not have jurisdiction over complaints concerning yellow page listings and advertisements; however, this subsection shall not be construed in any manner to limit the commission's authority in the ratemaking process to impute to the telecommunications company the revenues and costs of the telecommunications company's parent corporation, affiliated corporations, subsidiary corporations or divisions to the extent that those revenues and costs are associated with yellow page listings or advertisements in the state of Missouri. The commission shall not have jurisdiction over complaints concerning the rates charged by a telephone cooperative for providing telecommunications service within an exchange or within a local calling scope as determined by the commission, except the rates for providing exchange access service.\n\n(RSMo 1939 §§ 5622, 5669, A. 1949 H.B. 2099, A.L. 1977 H.B. 42 & 157, A.L. 1985 S.B. 376, A.L. 1988 S.B. 481, A.L. 1991 S.B. 269, A.L. 1996 S.B. 630 merged with S.B. 780)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 §§ 5166, 5213; 1919 §§ 10455, 10501",

Whenever the commission shall be of the opinion that a public utility, municipal gas system, person or corporation is failing or omitting or about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by law or by order or decision of the commission, or is doing anything or about to do anything or permitting anything or about to permit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of law or of any order or decision of the commission, it shall direct the general counsel to the commission to commence an action or proceeding in any circuit court of the state of Missouri in the name of the commission for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented either by mandamus or injunctions. The commission's general counsel shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by a petition to such court alleging the violation complained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction. Such relief shall not be limited to permanent forms of mandamus and injunction, but shall include all available forms of injunction and mandamus, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, permanent injunctions, preliminary orders of mandamus, and permanent orders of mandamus.\n\n2.

Estimate of expenses — assessments against utilities — public service commission fund — statement on gross intrastate operating revenues. —1. The commission shall, prior to the beginning of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year commencing on July 1, 1947, make an estimate of the expenses to be incurred by it during such fiscal year reasonably attributable to the regulation of public utilities as provided in chapters 386, 392 and 393 and shall also separately estimate the amount of such expenses directly attributable to such regulation of each of the following groups of public utilities: electrical corporations, gas corporations, water corporations, heating companies and telephone corporations, telegraph corporations, sewer corporations, and any other public utility as defined in section 386.020, as well as the amount of such expenses not directly attributable to any such group. For purposes of this section, water corporations and sewer corporations will be combined and considered one group of public utilities.\n\n2. The commission shall allocate to each such group of public utilities the estimated expenses directly attributable to the regulation of such group and an amount equal to such proportion of the estimated expenses not directly attributable to any group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group during the preceding calendar year bears to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of all public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, as aforesaid, during such calendar year. The commission shall then assess the amount so allocated to each group of public utilities, subject to reduction as herein provided, to the public utilities in such group in proportion to their respective gross intrastate operating revenues during the preceding calendar year, except that the total amount so assessed to all such public utilities, except telecommunications corporations, shall not exceed four hundred fifty thousandths of one percent of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of all public utilities, except telecommunications corporations, subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The total amount to be assessed to all telecommunications corporations, including interconnected voice over internet protocol service providers, shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousandths of one percent of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of all telecommunications corporations and interconnected voice over internet protocol service providers subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\n\n3. The commission shall render a statement of such assessment to each such public utility on or before July first and the amount so assessed to each such public utility shall be paid by it to the director of revenue in full on or before July fifteenth next following the rendition of such statement, except that any such public utility may at its election pay such assessment in four equal installments not later than the following dates next following the rendition of said statement, to wit: July fifteenth, October fifteenth, January fifteenth and April fifteenth.

Any amount remaining in such special fund or its successor fund at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the general revenue fund, but shall be applicable by appropriation of the general assembly to the payment of such expenditures of the commission in the succeeding fiscal year and shall be applied by the commission to the reduction of the amount to be assessed to such public utilities in such succeeding fiscal year, such reduction to be allocated to each group of public utilities in proportion to the respective gross intrastate operating revenues of the respective groups during the preceding calendar year.\n\n5. In order to enable the commission to make the allocations and assessments herein provided for, each public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the commission as aforesaid shall file with the commission, within ten days after August 28, 1996, and thereafter on or before March thirty-first of each year, a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year, and if any public utility shall fail to file such statement within the time aforesaid the commission shall estimate such revenue which estimate shall be binding on such public utility for the purpose of this section.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5706, A.L. 1947 V.

In granting the applicant's request the commission shall give due regard to territories previously granted to or served by other electric service suppliers and the wasteful duplication of electric service facilities.\n\n2. Any municipally owned electric utility may extend, pursuant to lawful annexation, its electric service territory to include areas where another electric supplier currently is not providing permanent service to a structure. If a rural electric cooperative has existing electric service facilities with adequate and necessary service capability located in or within one mile outside the boundaries of the area proposed to be annexed, a majority of the existing developers, landowners, or prospective electric customers in the area proposed to be annexed may, anytime within forty-five days prior to the effective date of the annexation, submit a written request to the governing body of the annexing municipality to invoke mandatory good faith negotiations under section 394.312 to determine which electric service supplier is best suited to serve all or portions of the newly annexed area. In such negotiations the following factors shall be considered, at a minimum:\n\n(1) The preference of landowners and prospective electric customers;\n\n(2) The rates, terms, and conditions of service of the electric service suppliers;\n\n(3) The economic impact on the electric service suppliers;\n\n(4) Each electric service supplier's operational ability to serve all or portions of the annexed area within three years of the date the annexation becomes effective;\n\n(5) Avoiding the wasteful duplication of electric facilities;\n\n(6) Minimizing unnecessary encumbrances on the property and landscape within the area to be annexed; and\n\n(7) Preventing the waste of materials and natural resources.\n\n­­If the municipally owned electric utility and rural electric cooperative are unable to negotiate a territorial agreement pursuant to section 394.312 within forty-five days, then they may submit proposals to those submitting the original written request, whose preference shall control, section 394.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, and the governing body of the annexing municipality shall not reject the petition requesting annexation based on such preference. This subsection shall not apply to municipally owned property in any newly annexed area.\n\n3. In the event an electrical corporation rather than a municipally owned electric utility lawfully is providing electric service in the municipality, all the provisions of subsection 2 of this section shall apply equally as if the electrical corporation were a municipally owned electric utility, except that if the electrical corporation and the rural electric cooperative are unable to negotiate a territorial agreement pursuant to section 394.312 within forty-five days, then either electric service supplier may file an application with the commission for an order determining which electric service supplier should serve, in whole or in part, the area to be annexed. The application shall be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity. The commission after the opportunity for hearing shall make its determination after consideration of the factors set forth in subdivisions (1) to*(7) of subsection 2 of this section, and section 394.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, may grant its order upon a finding that granting of the applicant's request is not detrimental to the public interest. The commission shall issue its decision by report and order no later than one hundred twenty days from the date of the application unless otherwise ordered by the commission for good cause shown. Review of such commission decisions shall be governed by sections 386.500 to 386.550. If the applicant is a rural electric cooperative, the commission shall charge to the rural electric cooperative the appropriate fees as set forth in subsection 9 of this section.\n\n4. When a municipally owned electric utility desires to extend its service territory to include any structure located within a newly annexed area which has received permanent service from another electric service supplier within ninety days prior to the effective date of the annexation, it shall:\n\n(1) Notify by publication in a newspaper of general circulation the record owner of said structure, and notify in writing any affected electric service supplier and the public service commission, within sixty days after the effective date of the annexation its desire to extend its service territory to include said structure; and\n\n(2) Within six months after the effective date of the annexation receive the approval of the municipality's governing body to begin negotiations pursuant to section 394.312 with the affected electric service supplier.\n\n5. Upon receiving approval from the municipality's governing body pursuant to subsection 4 of this section, the municipally owned electric utility and the affected electric service supplier shall meet and negotiate in good faith the terms of the territorial agreement and any transfers or acquisitions, including, as an alternative, granting the affected electric service supplier a franchise or authority to continue providing service in the annexed area. In the event that the affected electric service supplier does not provide wholesale electric power to the municipality, if the affected electric service supplier so desires, the parties may also negotiate, consistent with applicable law, regulations and existing power supply agreements, for power contracts which would provide for the purchase of power by the municipality from the affected electric service supplier for an amount of power equivalent to the loss of any sales to customers receiving permanent service at structures within the annexed areas which are being sought by the municipally owned electric utility. The parties shall have no more than one hundred eighty days from the date of receiving approval from the municipality's governing body within which to conclude their negotiations and file their territorial agreement with the commission for approval under the provisions of section 394.312. The time period for negotiations allowed under this subsection may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days by a mutual agreement of the parties and a written request with the public service commission.\n\n6. For purposes of this section, the term\"fair and reasonable compensation\"shall mean the following:\n\n(1) The present-day reproduction cost, new, of the properties and facilities serving the annexed areas, less depreciation computed on a straight-line basis; and\n\n(2) An amount equal to the reasonable and prudent cost of detaching the facilities in the annexed areas and the reasonable and prudent cost of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the affected electric service supplier outside the annexed area after detaching the portion to be transferred to the municipally owned electric utility; and\n\n(3) Two hundred percent of gross revenues less gross receipts taxes received by the affected electric service supplier from the twelve-month period preceding the approval of the municipality's governing body under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section, normalized to produce a representative usage from customers at the subject structures in the annexed area; and\n\n(4) Any federal, state and local taxes which may be incurred as a result of the transaction, including the recapture of any deduction or credit; and\n\n(5) Any other costs reasonably incurred by the affected electric supplier in connection with the transaction.\n\n7. In the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement under subsection 5 of this section, within sixty days after the expiration of the time specified for negotiations, the municipally owned electric utility or the affected electric service supplier may apply to the commission for an order assigning exclusive service territories within the annexed area and a determination of the fair and reasonable compensation amount to be paid to the affected electric service supplier under subsection 6 of this section. Applications shall be made and notice of such filing shall be given to all affected parties pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission for good cause shown, the commission shall rule on such applications not later than one hundred twenty days after the application is properly filed with the secretary of the commission. The commission shall hold evidentiary hearings to assign service territory between the affected electric service suppliers inside the annexed area and to determine the amount of compensation due any affected electric service supplier for the transfer of plant, facilities or associated lost revenues between electric service suppliers in the annexed area. The commission shall make such determinations based on findings of what best serves the public interest and shall issue its decision by report and order. Review of such commission decisions shall be governed by sections 386.500 to 386.550. The payment of compensation and transfer of title and operation of the facilities shall occur within ninety days after the order and any appeal therefrom becomes final unless the order provides otherwise.\n\n8. In reaching its decision under subsection 7 of this section, the commission shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) Whether the acquisition or transfers sought by the municipally owned electric utility within the annexed area from the affected electric service supplier are, in total, in the public interest, including the preference of the owner of any affected structure, consideration of rate disparities between the competing electric service suppliers, and issues of unjust rate discrimination among customers of a single electric service supplier if the rates to be charged in the annexed areas are lower than those charged to other system customers; and\n\n(2) The fair and reasonable compensation to be paid by the municipally owned electric utility, to the affected electric service supplier with existing system operations within the annexed area, for any proposed acquisitions or transfers; and\n\n(3) Any effect on system operation, including, but not limited to, loss of load and loss of revenue; and\n\n(4) Any other issues upon which the municipally owned electric utility and the affected electric service supplier might otherwise agree, including, but not limited to, the valuation formulas and factors contained in subsections 5, 6, and 7, of this section, even if the parties could not voluntarily reach an agreement thereon under those subsections.\n\n9. The commission is hereby given all necessary jurisdiction over municipally owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives to carry out the purposes of this section consistent with other applicable law; provided, however, the commission shall not have jurisdiction to compel the transfer of customers or structures with a connected load greater than one thousand kilowatts. The commission shall by rule set appropriate fees to be charged on a case-by-case basis to municipally owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives to cover all necessary costs incurred by the commission in carrying out its duties under this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as otherwise conferring upon the public service commission jurisdiction over the service, rates, financing, accounting, or management of any rural electric cooperative or municipally owned electric utility, except as provided in this section.\n\n10. Notwithstanding sections 394.020 and 394.080 to the contrary, a rural electric cooperative may provide electric service within the corporate boundaries of a municipality if such service is provided:\n\n(1) Pursuant to subsections 2 to*9 of this section; and\n\n(2) Such service is conditioned upon the execution of the appropriate territorial and municipal franchise agreements, which may include a nondiscriminatory requirement, consistent with other applicable law, that the rural electric cooperative collect and remit a sales tax based on the amount of electricity sold by the rural electric cooperative within the municipality.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 221, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271 merged with H.B. 734 merged with S.B. 44)\n\n*Word \"through\" appears in original rolls of H.B. 271 and S.B. 44, 2021.",

For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Advanced meter\", a meter or metering device system that is owned or leased by a utility or its agent and that meets one or more of the following requirements:\n\n(a) Measures, records, and sends a customer's utility usage or other data by use of radio waves or broadband over power lines;\n\n(b) Allows for two-way communication between the meter and the utility or its agent; and\n\n(c) Allows for a utility or its agent to control a customer's thermostat, appliance, or service;\n\n(2)\"Hub meter\", an advanced meter that generates stronger radio waves as a result of the meter serving as a hub for other advanced meters it communicates with in a given area;\n\n(3)\"Inaccurate information\", the intentional under-reporting of meter data in an effort to not pay for services. Inaccurate information does not mean minor differences in readings by less than two percent to account for variations based on the time of day that the meter is read and similar factors;\n\n(4)\"Regular basis\", once per billing cycle;\n\n(5)\"Traditional meter\", a commercially available meter that is unable to transmit usage information and is only intended to be read by an individual through a visual display. A traditional meter is not designed or capable of transmitting usage data by using radio waves or broadband over power lines, allowing two-way communication between the meter and the utility or its agents, or allowing a utility or its agents to control a customer's thermostat, appliance, or service. A traditional meter does not include an advanced meter that has certain functionality turned off or deactivated;\n\n(6)\"Utility\", any public utility that is rate regulated by the public service commission under chapter*386 or 393.\n\n2. (1) The commission shall promulgate commercially reasonable rules governing an opt-out process using an advanced meter or hub meter for customers no later than June 30, 2026. Commencing July 1, 2026, a residential utility customer may at any time communicate with the utility that the customer would like to opt out of using an advanced meter or hub meter.\n\n(2) Within a commercially reasonable time after receiving a residential customer's request that an advanced meter be removed from the customer's residence or business, a utility shall remove the advanced meter and replace it at a location of the utility's choice with a traditional meter. A utility may charge a one-time all-inclusive fee, not to exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars, to remove the advanced meter and to provide and install a traditional meter. A utility may charge a monthly fee, not to exceed fifteen dollars, for the use of a traditional meter.\n\n(3) If a residential customer utilizes a traditional meter and desires to read its own meter rather than having the utility read the meter, the customer shall report accurate energy usage to the utility on a regular basis. A utility shall provide the customer with the detailed process to report meter readings on a secure website, by telephone, or by other commercially reasonable means. At least once every twelve months, the utility shall obtain an actual meter reading of the customer's energy usage to verify the accuracy of readings reported under this section. Notwithstanding this subsection to the contrary, a representative of a utility may manually read the customer's meter on a regular basis as otherwise permitted by law and correct a reading as necessary. If the customer fails to report usage, inaccurately reports usage, or the utility does not receive the customer's service usage report on time, the utility may manually read the customer's meter or charge that customer based on an estimate of prior energy use in a manner approved by the commission. The utility may charge the customer interest on any unpaid amount due to the customer's failure to report usage or inaccurate report of usage in any given billing cycle. Such interest rate shall be no greater than five percent. The commission is authorized to approve charges to be assessed pursuant to an electrical corporation's rate schedule to be assessed on customers that intentionally report inaccurate usage.\n\n(4) A utility shall not be liable for any injuries or other damages sustained by a customer or other individuals due to a customer's reading of the customer's utility usage unless such injuries or damages are caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the utility.\n\n3.
