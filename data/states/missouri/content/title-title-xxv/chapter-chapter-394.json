In no case filed after August 28, 2018, may evidence of revenues or profits derived, nor the rental value of an assembled communications corridor, be admissible in determining fair market value. Such actual damages shall be fixed at the time of the initial trespass, shall not be deemed to continue, accumulate, or accrue, and upon payment of damages the defendant shall be granted a permanent easement for the trespass litigated. If a property owner prevails in such suits, punitive damages may be assessed and the property owner may be awarded additional compensation for any physical damages to the property directly resulting from the trespass, if any, and reasonable attorneys'*fees, costs, and expenses consistent with subsection 4 of section 523.283;\n\n(12) To conduct its business and exercise any or all of its powers within or without this state;\n\n(13) To adopt, amend and repeal bylaws; and\n\n(14) To do and perform any and all other acts and things, and to have and exercise any and all other powers which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to accomplish the purpose for which the cooperative is organized.\n\n2.

The provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section shall in no way affect or diminish the rights and duties of any city, town or village to grant franchises to electric suppliers in the manner provided by law or of any electrical corporation authorized by law to provide electric service at retail within such city, town or village.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2 of this section, after a public hearing upon a complaint, the public service commission may order that service be provided by another supplier if it finds that service from another supplier of electricity is in the public interest for a reason other than rate differential. Nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring upon the public service commission jurisdiction over the rates, financing, accounting or management of any electric cooperative.\n\n6.

In recognition that the high capital cost of deploying fiber optics technologies to provide broadband communications services impedes access to such services, and the rural electric cooperatives deploy fiber optics technologies for use in the operation of their electric system infrastructure, it is the intent of the general assembly to facilitate and to encourage rural electric cooperatives and their affiliates, either collectively, or individually, to continue to enter into and establish voluntary contracts or other forms of joint or cooperative agreements for the use of rural electric cooperative infrastructure in providing access to broadband services.\n\n3.

Territorial agreements authorized, procedure — public service commission, duties, fees may be set. —1. Competition to provide retail electric service, as between rural electric cooperatives, electrical corporations and municipally owned utilities may be displaced by written territorial agreements, but only to the extent hereinafter provided for in this section.\n\n2. Such territorial agreements shall specifically designate the boundaries of the electric service area of each electric service supplier subject to the agreement, any and all powers granted to a rural electric cooperative by a municipality, pursuant to the agreement, to operate within the corporate boundaries of that municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of section 394.020 and of section 394.080 to the contrary, and any and all powers granted to a municipally owned utility, pursuant to the agreement, to operate in areas beyond the corporate municipal boundaries of its municipality.\n\n3. Where the parties cannot agree upon the boundaries of the electric service areas that are to be set forth in the agreement, they may, by mutual consent of all parties involved, petition the public service commission to designate the boundaries of the electric service areas to be served by each party and such designations by the commission shall be binding on all such parties. Petitions shall be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity and the commission shall hold evidentiary hearings on all petitions so received as required in subsection 5 of this section. The commission shall base its final determination regarding such petitions upon a finding that the commission's designation of electric service areas is in the public interest.\n\n4. The provisions of sections 386.310 and 393.106 and sections 394.160 and 394.315 to the contrary notwithstanding, before becoming effective, all territorial agreements entered into under the provisions of this section, including any subsequent amendments to such agreements, or the transfer or assignment of the agreement or any rights or obligations of any party to an agreement, shall receive the approval of the public service commission by report and order. Applications for commission approval shall be made and notice of such filing shall be given to other electrical suppliers pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission for good cause shown, the commission shall rule on such applications not later than one hundred twenty days after the application is properly filed with the secretary of the commission.\n\n5. The commission shall hold evidentiary hearings to determine whether such territorial agreements should be approved or disapproved, except that in those instances where the matter is resolved by a stipulation and agreement submitted to the commission by all the parties such hearings may be waived by agreement of the parties. The commission may approve the application if it determines that approval of the territorial agreement in total is not detrimental to the public interest. Review of commission decisions under this section shall be governed by the provisions of sections 386.500 to 386.550.\n\n6. Commission approval of any territorial agreement entered into under the provisions of this section shall in no way affect or diminish the rights and duties of any supplier not a party to the agreement or of any electrical corporation authorized by law to provide service within the boundaries designated in such territorial agreement. In the event any electrical corporation which is not a party to the territorial agreement and which is subject to the jurisdiction, control and regulation of the commission under chapters 386 and 393 has heretofore sought or hereafter seeks authorization from the commission to render electric service or construct, operate and maintain electric facilities within the boundaries designated in any such territorial agreement, the commission, in making its determination regarding such requested authority, shall give no consideration or weight to the existence of any such territorial agreement and any actual rendition of retail electric service by any of the parties to such territorial agreement will not preclude the commission from granting the requested authority.\n\n7. The commission shall have jurisdiction to entertain and hear complaints involving any commission-approved territorial agreement. Such complaints shall be brought and prosecuted in the same manner as other complaints before the commission. The commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing regarding such complaints, except that in those instances where the matter is resolved by a stipulation and agreement submitted to the commission by all the parties, such hearings may be waived by agreement of the parties. If the commission determines that a territorial agreement that is the subject of a complaint is no longer in the public interest, it shall have the authority to suspend or revoke the territorial agreement. If the commission determines that the territorial agreement is still in the public interest, such territorial agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Except as provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be construed as otherwise conferring upon the commission jurisdiction over the service, rates, financing, accounting, or management of any rural electric cooperative or municipally owned utility, or to amend, modify, or otherwise limit the rights of electrical suppliers to provide service as otherwise provided by law.\n\n8. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 386.410, the commission shall by rule set a schedule of fees based upon its costs in reviewing proposed territorial agreements for approval or disapproval. Responsibility for payment of the fees shall be that of the parties to the proceeding as ordered by the commission in each case. The fees shall be paid to the director of revenue who shall remit such payments to the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall credit such payments to the public service commission fund, or its successor fund, as established in section 33.571. Nothing in this section shall be construed as otherwise conferring upon the commission jurisdiction over the service, rates, financing, accounting or management of any rural electric cooperative or municipally owned utility and except as provided in this section nothing shall affect the rights, privileges or duties of rural electric cooperatives, electrical corporations or municipally owned utilities.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the commission may hold a hearing regarding any application, complaint or petition filed under this section upon its own motion.\n\n(L. 1988 S.B. 689, A.L. 1989 H.B. 813, A.L. 2007 S.B. 416)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nAntitrust laws not applicable to territorial agreements, 416.041",

Definitions — rural electric cooperative exclusive right to serve structures, exception — change of suppliers, procedure — new structure built, effect of. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Permanent service\", electrical service provided through facilities which have been permanently installed on a structure and which are designed to provide electric service for the structure's anticipated needs for the indefinite future, as contrasted with facilities installed temporarily to provide electrical service during construction. Service provided temporarily shall be at the risk of the electrical supplier and shall not be determinative of the rights of the provider or recipient of permanent service;\n\n(2)\"Structure\"or\"structures\", an agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial or other building or a mechanical installation, machinery or apparatus at which retail electric energy is being delivered through a metering device which is located on or adjacent to the structure and connected to the lines of an electrical supplier. Such terms shall include any contiguous or adjacent additions to or expansions of a particular structure. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer any right on an electric supplier to serve new structures on a particular tract of land because it was serving an existing structure on that tract.\n\n2. Once a rural electric cooperative, or its predecessor in interest, lawfully commences supplying retail electric energy to a structure through permanent service facilities, it shall have the right to continue serving such structure, and other suppliers of electrical energy shall not have the right to provide service to the structure except as might be otherwise permitted in the context of municipal annexation, pursuant to section 386.800 and section 394.080, or pursuant to a territorial agreement approved under section 394.312. The public service commission, upon application made by an affected party, may order a change of suppliers on the basis that it is in the public interest for a reason other than a rate differential, and the commission is hereby given jurisdiction over rural electric cooperatives to accomplish the purpose of this section. The commission's jurisdiction under this section is limited to public interest determinations and excludes questions as to the lawfulness of the provision of service, such questions being reserved to courts of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided herein, nothing in this section shall be construed as otherwise conferring upon the commission jurisdiction over the service, rates, financing, accounting or management of any such cooperative, and except as provided in this section, nothing contained herein shall affect the rights, privileges or duties of existing cooperatives pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make lawful any provision of service which was unlawful prior to July 11, 1991. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make unlawful the continued lawful provision of service to any structure which may have had a different supplier in the past, if such a change in supplier was lawful at the time it occurred. However, those customers who had cancelled service with their previous supplier or had requested cancellation by May 1, 1991, shall be eligible to change suppliers as per previous procedures. No customer shall be allowed to change electric suppliers by disconnecting service between May 1, 1991, and July 11, 1991.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections*91.025,*393.106, and*394.080 to the contrary, in the event that a retail electric supplier is providing service to a structure located within a city, town, or village that has ceased to be a rural area, and such structure is demolished and replaced by a new structure, such retail electric service supplier may provide permanent service to the new structure upon the request of the owner of the new structure.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1646 § 2, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1486, A.L. 1991 S.B. 221, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271 merged with H.B. 734 merged with S.B. 44)\n\n*Word \"section\" appears here in original rolls of H.B. 271 and H.B. 734, 2021.\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nElectric vehicle charging station considered an addition or expansion of existing structure, when, 386.805",
