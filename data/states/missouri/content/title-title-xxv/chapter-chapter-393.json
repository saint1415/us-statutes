Termination of water service for nonpayment of sewer bill, when — immunity from civil liability — procedure to establish agreement, contents of agreement — exceptions. —1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any municipality providing water, or any water district established under chapter 247, which in this section shall sometimes be designated as a water provider, shall upon request of any municipality providing sewer service or public sewer district established under chapter 249 or 250, or sections 204.250 to 204.470, or any sewer district created and organized under constitutional authority, which in this section shall sometimes be designated as a sewer provider, contract with such sewer provider to terminate water services to any water user of such water provider for nonpayment of a delinquent sewer bill owed to such sewer provider.\n\n2. Any water provider, or independent contractor acting for a water provider, acting under a contract with a sewer provider under this section shall be exempt from all civil liability whatsoever arising from or related to termination of water services pursuant to any such contract.\n\n3. In the event that any water provider and any sewer provider are unable to reach an agreement as provided in this section within six months of the receipt of such request by the water provider, then the sewer provider making the written request may file with the circuit court in which such water provider was incorporated, or if such water provider was not incorporated by a circuit court, then with a circuit court having jurisdiction of the water provider, a petition requesting that three commissioners be selected to draft such an agreement.\n\n4. Any agreement drafted by the commissioners or entered into under this section shall contain the following provisions:\n\n(1) The rules and regulations or ordinances of the sewer provider shall provide that the number of days of delinquency required before water service is discontinued for failure to pay for sewage service shall be equal to the number of days of delinquency required before water service is discontinued for failure to pay for water service under the rules and regulations of the water provider;\n\n(2) The water provider shall not be required to discontinue water service to the sewer user for failure to pay the charges or rental due therefor unless the sewer provider shall first give a written notice to the water provider to do so. Such notice shall include the due date, amount of the delinquent bill, and all penalties and interest thereon. When payment of such amount is received by the sewer provider, upon written notice thereof to the water provider, the water provider shall restore water service to the water and sewer user, provided the water bill of such user owed to the water provider is not delinquent;\n\n(3) The sewer provider shall at all times keep in force a general comprehensive public liability and property damage policy issued by a company authorized to do business in Missouri with policy limits equal to or in excess of those set forth in section 537.610 shall include the water provider and any independent contractor who performs such agreement under contract with the water provider thereon as an additional insured, and shall furnish the water provider and such independent contractor a certificate of insurance evidencing such insurance is in effect. If at any time it fails to do so and furnish such certificate of insurance to the water provider and such independent contractor, the water provider and such independent contractor may cease to make water service terminations until such requirement is satisfied;\n\n(4) The agreement shall provide that any loss of revenue incurred by the water provider as a result of discontinuing water service because of the failure of any sewage user to pay the charges or rental therefor shall be paid to the water provider by the sewer provider. Such amounts include, but are not limited to, loss of revenue by the water provider caused by disconnection of water service for a sewer bill delinquency when the water bill is not delinquent;\n\n(5) When a water provider is collecting delinquent amounts for both the water and sewer service, all delinquent payments due to both the water and sewer provider shall be received by the water provider before water service is restored. If for any reason water service is never restored, any amount collected for delinquent accounts due both water and sewer provider shall be divided between the water provider and the sewer provider so that each receives the same percentage of the amount owed to it;\n\n(6) The agreement shall provide that in the event the water provider or any independent contractor who performs such agreement under contract with the water provider incurs attorney fees or other costs not covered by insurance as a result of any claim, litigation, or threatened litigation against the water provider or independent contractor which exceeds the limits of insurance coverage provided to the water provider or independent contractor by the sewer provider as stated in this section, the sewer provider shall reimburse such amounts to the water provider or independent contractor;\n\n(7) The agreement shall contain a provision providing that the expense and cost of the water provider shall be recalculated annually and that the amount due it during the subsequent year shall be increased or decreased according to any change occurring in the costs and expenses; alternatively, upon agreement of the parties to the agreement, the agreement may provide for annual increases or decreases based upon the percentage of increase or decrease in the National Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, unadjusted for seasonal variation, as published by the United States Department of Labor for the most recent date prior to the annual anniversary date of the execution of the agreement;\n\n(8) All expense and cost incurred by the water provider in performing or carrying out the agreement shall be reimbursed to the water provider by the sewer provider. The reimbursement shall be made monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly. In determining such expense incurred by the water provider, the commissioners shall consider the following items of expense, whether such items will be incurred by the water provider, at the time the agreement is executed or in the future, and if so, the amount of such expense attributable to such agreement at the time such agreement is executed and in the future:\n\n(a) All personnel expense including, but not limited to, wages and salaries, employment taxes, retirement benefits, employment benefits, health insurance, and workers' compensation insurance;\n\n(b) All expense incurred by payments to independent contractors who perform or carry out the agreement under contract with the water provider;\n\n(c) Equipment expenses;\n\n(d) Computer and computer program expense;\n\n(e) Office space expense;\n\n(f) Insurance expense attributable to the agreement between the water provider and the sewer provider, including the additional insurance expense of any independent contractor who performs or carries out the agreement under contract with such water provider;\n\n(g) All other expense attributable to the agreement between the water and sewer provider;\n\n(9) The agreement shall terminate in twenty years unless a different term is agreed upon by the parties. Upon termination, the parties may agree to an extension thereof, not to exceed an additional twenty years;\n\n(10) If ownership of either the sewer system of the sewer provider or the water system of the water provider is transferred to another entity or person, the agreement shall terminate at the time of the transfer, unless the new owner and remaining owner agree otherwise.\n\n5. Upon the filing of such petition, the sewer provider shall appoint one commissioner. The water provider shall appoint a commissioner within thirty days of the service of the petition upon it. If the water provider fails to appoint a commissioner within such time period, the court shall appoint a commissioner on behalf of the water provider within forty-five days of service of the petition on the water provider. The two named commissioners shall agree to appoint a third commissioner within thirty days after the appointment of the second commissioner, but in the event that they fail to do so, the court shall appoint a third commissioner within sixty days after the appointment of the second commissioner.\n\n6. The commissioners shall draft an agreement between the water provider and sewer provider meeting the requirements established in this section. Before drafting such agreement, the water provider and sewer provider shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and information pertaining to such agreement at a hearing to be held by the commissioners, of which each party shall receive fifteen days' written notice. The hearing may be continued from time to time by the commissioners. The commissioners shall consider all evidence and information submitted to them and prepare such agreement as provided under this section. The agreement shall be submitted to the court within ninety days of the selection or appointment of the last commissioner as provided under this section.\n\n7. If the court finds that the agreement is fair, reasonable, and meets the requirements of this section, then the court shall enter its judgment approving the agreement and order it to become effective sixty days after the date of such judgment. If the court finds such agreement is not fair and reasonable or does not meet the requirements of this section, the court shall return it to the commissioners with its reasons for rejecting the agreement. The commissioners shall make the required changes and resubmit the agreement to the court. Upon approval of the agreement by the court, judgment shall be entered approving the agreement and ordering it to become effective sixty days after the date of such judgment. Thereafter, the parties shall abide by such agreement. If either party fails to do so, the other party may file an action to compel compliance. Venue shall be in the court issuing such judgment.\n\n8. The judgment and order of the court shall be subject to appeal as provided by law. All costs, including commissioners' compensation, shall be taxed to and paid by the sewer provider requesting an agreement. The court shall determine and order payment of fees of expert witnesses of the water provider by the sewer provider to the water provider.\n\n9. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any city not within a county or any county with a charter form of government and with more than one million inhabitants.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 58)",

Definitions — electric power suppliers exclusive right to serve structures, exception — change of suppliers, procedure — purchase of auxillary power — permanent service supplied to nonrural area, when. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Auxiliary power\", the energy used to operate equipment and other load that is directly related to the production of energy by an independent power producer or electrical corporation, obtained through generation at the site or through adjacent transformation and transmission interconnect, but does not include energy used for space heating, lighting, air conditioning, office needs of buildings, and other nongenerating uses at the generation site;\n\n(2)\"Independent power producer\"or\"IPP\", an entity that is also considered a nonutility power producer in the United States. IPPs are wholesale electricity producers that operate within the franchised service territories of host utilities and are usually authorized to sell at market-based rates. Unlike traditional electric utilities, IPPs do not possess transmission facilities or sell electricity in the retail market;\n\n(3)\"Permanent service\", electrical service provided through facilities which have been permanently installed on a structure and which are designed to provide electric service for the structure's anticipated needs for the indefinite future, as contrasted with facilities installed temporarily to provide electrical service during construction. Service provided temporarily shall be at the risk of the electrical supplier and shall not be determinative of the rights of the provider or recipient of permanent service;\n\n(4)\"Structure\"or\"structures\", an agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial or other building or a mechanical installation, machinery or apparatus at which retail electric energy is being delivered through a metering device which is located on or adjacent to the structure and connected to the lines of an electrical supplier. Such terms shall include any contiguous or adjacent additions to or expansions of a particular structure. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer any right on an electric supplier to serve new structures on a particular tract of land because it was serving an existing structure on that tract.\n\n2. Once an electrical corporation or joint municipal utility commission, or its predecessor in interest, lawfully commences supplying retail electric energy to a structure through permanent service facilities, it shall have the right to continue serving such structure, and other suppliers of electrical energy shall not have the right to provide service to the structure except as might be otherwise permitted in the context of municipal annexation, pursuant to section 386.800 and section 394.080, or pursuant to a territorial agreement approved under section 394.312. The public service commission, upon application made by an affected party, may order a change of suppliers on the basis that it is in the public interest for a reason other than a rate differential. The commission's jurisdiction under this section is limited to public interest determinations and excludes questions as to the lawfulness of the provision of service, such questions being reserved to courts of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided in this section, nothing contained herein shall affect the rights, privileges or duties of existing corporations pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make lawful any provision of service which was unlawful prior to July 11, 1991. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make unlawful the continued lawful provision of service to any structure which may have had a different supplier in the past, if such a change in supplier was lawful at the time it occurred. However, those customers who had cancelled service with their previous supplier or had requested cancellation by May 1, 1991, shall be eligible to change suppliers as per previous procedures. No customer shall be allowed to change electric suppliers by disconnecting service between May 1, 1991, and July 11, 1991.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2 of this section or any other provision of chapter*386 or 394 to the contrary, auxiliary power may be purchased on a wholesale basis, under the applicable federal tariffs of a regional transmission organization instead of under retail service tariffs filed with the public service commission by an electrical corporation, for use at an electric generation facility located in any county of the first classification with more than ninety-two thousand but fewer than one hundred one thousand inhabitants which commenced commercial operations prior to August 28, 2021, and which is operated as an independent power producer.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section,**and sections 91.025, 394.080, and 394.315**to the contrary, in the event that a retail electric supplier is providing service to a structure located within a city, town, or village that has ceased to be a rural area, and such structure is demolished and replaced by a new structure, such retail electric service supplier may provide permanent service to the new structure upon the request of the owner of the new structure.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1646 § 1, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1486, A.L. 1991 S.B. 221, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271 merged with H.B. 734 merged with S.B. 44)\n\n*Word \"chapters\" appears in original rolls of H.B. 734, 2021.\n\n**...**Words \"section 91.025, section 394.080, and section 394.315\" appear in original rolls of H.B. 271 and H.B. 734, 2021.\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nElectric vehicle charging station considered an addition or expansion of existing structure, when, 386.805",

Every gas corporation, every electrical corporation, every water corporation, and every sewer corporation shall furnish and provide such service instrumentalities and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable. All charges made or demanded by any such gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation for gas, electricity, water, sewer or any service rendered or to be rendered shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by law or by order or decision of the commission. Every unjust or unreasonable charge made or demanded for gas, electricity, water, sewer or any such service, or in connection therewith, or in excess of that allowed by law or by order or decision of the commission is prohibited.\n\n2.

For the purpose of determining whether the gas manufactured, distributed or sold by such persons or corporations for lighting, heating or power purposes conforms to the standards of illuminating power, purity and pressure, and for the purpose of determining whether the efficiency of the electric supply system, of the current supplied and of the lamps furnished, and for the purpose of determining whether the water furnished or sold conforms to the standard of purity and pressure, and for the purpose of determining whether the sewer system conforms to the standards for designing, constructing, operating and maintaining sewer systems, and conforms to the orders issued by the commission, the commission shall have power, of its own motion, to examine and investigate the plants and methods employed in manufacturing, delivering and supplying gas, electricity or water, and the collecting, carrying, treating and disposing of sewage, and shall have access, through its members or persons employed and authorized by it, to make such examinations and investigations to all parts of the manufacturing plants owned, used or operated for the manufacture, transmission or distribution of gas or electricity by any such person or corporation, and to all parts of the systems owned, used or operated for the supplying and distribution of water and the collecting, carrying, treating and disposing of sewage by any such person or corporation. Any employee or agent of the commission who divulges any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the course of any such inspection or examination, except insofar as he may be directed by the commission, or by a court or judge thereof, or authorized by law, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(4) Have power, in its discretion, to prescribe uniform methods of keeping accounts, records and books, to be observed by gas corporations, electrical corporations, water corporations and sewer corporations engaged in the manufacture, sale or distribution of gas and electricity for light, heat or power, or in the distribution and sale of water for any purpose whatsoever, or in the collection, carriage, treatment and disposal of sewage for municipal, domestic or other necessary beneficial purpose. It may also, in its discretion, prescribe, by order, forms of accounts, records and memoranda to be kept by such persons and corporations. Notice of alterations by the commission in the required method or form of keeping a system of accounts shall be given to such persons or corporations by the commission at least six months before the same shall take effect. Any other and additional forms of accounts, records and memoranda kept by such corporation shall be subject to examination by the commission.\n\n(5) Examine all persons and corporations under its supervision and keep informed as to the methods, practices, regulations and property employed by them in the transaction of their business. Whenever the commission shall be of the opinion, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, that the rates or charges or the acts or regulations of any such persons or corporations are unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential or in any wise in violation of any provision of law, the commission shall determine and prescribe the just and reasonable rates and charges thereafter to be in force for the service to be furnished, notwithstanding that a higher rate or charge has heretofore been authorized by statute, and the just and reasonable acts and regulations to be done and observed; and whenever the commission shall be of the opinion, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaints, that the property, equipment or appliances of any such person or corporation are unsafe, insufficient or inadequate, the commission shall determine and prescribe the safe, efficient and adequate property, equipment and appliances thereafter to be used, maintained and operated for the security and accommodation of the public and in compliance with the provisions of law and of their franchises and charters.\n\n(6) Require every person and corporation under its supervision and it shall be the duty of every person and corporation to file with the commission an annual report, verified by the oath of the president, treasurer, general manager or receiver, if any, thereof. The verification shall be made by said official holding office at the time of the filing of said report, and if not made upon the knowledge of the person verifying the same, shall set forth the sources of his information and the grounds of his belief as to any matters not stated to be verified upon his knowledge. The report shall show in detail the amount of its authorized capital stock and the amount thereof issued and outstanding; the amount of its authorized bonded indebtedness and the amount of its bonds and other forms of evidence of indebtedness issued and outstanding; its receipts and expenditures during the preceding year; the amount paid as dividends upon its stock and as interest upon its bonds; the names of its officers and the aggregate amount paid as salaries to them and the amount paid as wages to its employees; the location of its plant or plants and system, with a full description of its property and franchises, stating in detail how each franchise stated to be owned was acquired; and such other facts pertaining to the operation and maintenance of the plant and system, and the affairs of such person or corporation as may be required by the commission. Such reports shall be in the form, cover the period and be filed at the time prescribed by the commission. The commission may, from time to time, make changes and additions in such forms. When any such report is defective or believed to be erroneous, the commission shall notify the person or corporation making such report to amend the same within a time prescribed by the commission. Any such person or corporation which shall neglect to make any such report or which shall fail to correct any such report within the time prescribed by the commission shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars and an additional penalty of one hundred dollars for each day after the prescribed time for which it shall neglect to file or correct the same, to be sued for in the name of the state of Missouri. The amount recovered in any such action shall be paid to the public school fund of the state. The commission may extend the time prescribed for cause shown.\n\n(7) Have power, either through its members or inspectors or employees duly authorized by it, to enter in or upon and to inspect the property, buildings, plants, factories, powerhouses, ducts, conduits and offices of any such corporations or persons.\n\n(8) Have power to examine the accounts, books, contracts, records, documents and papers of any such corporation or person, and have power, after hearing, to prescribe by order the accounts in which particular outlays and receipts shall be entered, charged or credited.\n\n(9) Have power to compel, by subpoena duces tecum, the production of any accounts, books, contracts, records, documents, memoranda and papers. In lieu of requiring production of originals by subpoena duces tecum the commission or any commissioner may require sworn copies of any such books, records, contracts, documents and papers, or parts thereof, to be filed with it. The commission may require of all such corporations or persons specific answers to questions upon which the commission may need information, and may also require such corporations or persons to file periodic reports in the form, covering the period and filed at the time prescribed by the commission. If such corporation or person shall fail to make specific answer to any question or shall fail to make a periodic report when required by the commission as herein provided within the time and in the form prescribed by the commission for the making and filing of any such report or answer, such corporation or person shall forfeit to the state the sum of one hundred dollars for each and every day it shall continue to be in default with respect to such report or answer. Such forfeiture shall be recovered in an action brought by the commission in the name of the state of Missouri. The amount recovered in any such action shall be paid to the public school fund of the state.\n\n(10) Have power in all parts of the state, either as a commission or through its members, to subpoena witnesses, take testimony and administer oaths to witnesses in any proceeding or examination instituted before it, or conducted by it, in reference to any matter under sections 393.110 to 393.285.\n\n(11) Have power to require every gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation, and sewer corporation to file with the commission and to print and keep open to public inspection schedules showing all rates and charges made, established or enforced or to be charged or enforced, all forms of contract or agreement and all rules and regulations relating to rates, charges or service used or to be used, and all general privileges and facilities granted or allowed by such gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation; but this subdivision shall not apply to state, municipal or federal contracts. Unless the commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made in any rate or charge, or in any form of contract or agreement, or any rule or regulation relating to any rate, charge or service, or in any general privilege or facility, which shall have been filed and published by a gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation in compliance with an order or decision of the commission, except after thirty days' notice to the commission and publication for thirty days as required by order of the commission, which shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the schedule then in force and the time when the change will go into effect. The commission for good cause shown may allow changes without requiring the thirty days' notice under such conditions as it may prescribe. No corporation shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered than the rates and charges applicable to such services as specified in its schedule filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any corporation refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates or charges so specified, nor to extend to any person or corporation any form of contract or agreement, or any rule or regulation, or any privilege or facility, except such as are regularly and uniformly extended to all persons and corporations under like circumstances. The commission shall have power to prescribe the form of every such schedule, and from time to time prescribe by order such changes in the form thereof as may be deemed wise. The commission shall also have power to establish such rules and regulations, to carry into effect the provisions of this subdivision, as it may deem necessary, and to modify and amend such rules or regulations from time to time.\n\n(12) In case any electrical corporation, gas corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation engaged in carrying on any other business than owning, operating or managing a gas plant, electric plant, water system or sewer system which other business is not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, and is so conducted that its operations are to be substantially kept separate and apart from the owning, operating, managing or controlling of such gas plant, electric plant, water system or sewer system, said corporation in respect to such other business shall not be subject to any of the provisions of this chapter and shall not be required to procure the consent or authorization of the commission to any act in such other business or to make any report in respect thereof. But this subdivision shall not restrict or limit the powers of the commission in respect to the owning, operating, managing or controlling by such corporation of such gas plant, electric plant, water system or sewer system, and said powers shall include also the right to inquire as to, and prescribe the apportionment of, capitalization, earnings, debts and expenses fairly and justly to be awarded to or borne by the ownership, operation, management or control of such gas plant, electric plant, water system or sewer system as distinguished from such other business. In any such case if the owning, operating, managing or controlling of such gas plant, electric plant, water system or sewer system by any such corporation is wholly subsidiary and incidental to the other business carried on by it and is inconsiderable in amount and not general in its character, the commission may by general rules exempt such corporation from making full reports and from the keeping of accounts as to such subsidiary and incidental business.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5646, A. 1949 H.B. 2165, A.L. 1967 p. 578)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5190; 1919 § 10478\n\n(1957) Action against electric power company for refund of moneys paid under written contract involving question of whether plaintiff had fully performed its part of contract held within jurisdiction of circuit court.

Certain utility may be placed under control of receiver — commission determination, procedure — appointment of receiver, bond. —1. If, after hearing, the commission determines that any sewer or water corporation that regularly provides service to eight thousand or fewer customer connections is unable or unwilling to provide safe and adequate service, has been actually or effectively abandoned by its owners, or has defaulted on a bond, note or loan issued or guaranteed by any department, office, commission, board, authority or other unit of state government, the commission may petition the circuit court for an order attaching the assets of the utility and placing the utility under the control and responsibility of a receiver. The venue of such cases shall, at the option of the commission, be in the circuit court of Cole County or in the circuit court of the county in which the utility company has its principal place of business.\n\n2. If the commission orders its general counsel to petition the circuit court for the appointment of a receiver under subsection 1 of this section, it may in the same order appoint an interim receiver for the sewer or water corporation. The interim receiver shall have the authority generally granted to a receiver under subsection 6 of this section, except that the commission cannot authorize the interim receiver to transfer by sale or liquidate the assets of the utility. The interim receiver shall be compensated in an amount to be determined by the commission. The interim receiver shall serve until a judgment on a petition for writ of review of the commission's order, if any, is final and unappealable, and until the circuit court thereafter determines under subsection 5 of this section whether to grant the commission's petition for appointment of receiver.\n\n3. When the commission files its petition for appointment of receiver in the circuit court, it shall attach to its petition an official copy of its determination under subsection 1 of this section. The commission shall not file such action until its determination under subsection 1 of this section is final and unappealable.\n\n4. The summons and petition for an order attaching the assets of the utility and appointing a receiver shall be served as in other civil cases at least five days before the return date of the summons. In addition to attempted personal service, upon request of the commission, the judge before whom the proceeding is commenced shall make an order directing that the officer or other person empowered to execute the summons shall also serve the same by securely affixing a copy of the summons and petition in a conspicuous place on the utility system in question at least ten days before the return date of the summons, and by also mailing a copy of the summons and petition to the defendant at its last known address by ordinary mail and by certified mail, return receipt requested, deliver to addressee only, at least ten days before the return date. If the officer or other person empowered to execute the summons makes return that personal service cannot be obtained on the defendant, and if proof be made by affidavit of the posting and of the mailing of a copy of the summons and petition, the judge shall, at the request of the commission, proceed to hear the case as if there had been personal service, and judgment shall be rendered and proceedings had as in other cases. If the commission does not request service of the original summons by posting and mailing, and if the officer or other person empowered to execute the summons makes return that personal service cannot be obtained on the defendant, the commission may request the issuance of an alias summons and service of the same by posting and mailing in the time and manner provided in this subsection. Upon proof by affidavit of the posting and of the mailing of a copy of the alias summons and the petition, the judge shall proceed to hear the case as if there had been personal service, and judgment shall be rendered and proceedings had as in other cases.\n\n5. The court, after hearing, may grant the commission's petition for appointment of a receiver. Where the defendant is in default, the court shall mail to the defendant at its last known address by certified mail with a request for return receipt and with directions to deliver to the addressee only, a notice informing the defendant of the judgment and the date it was entered. A receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall be a responsible person, partnership, or corporation knowledgeable in the operation of utilities.\n\n6. The receiver shall give bond, and have the same powers and be subject to all the provisions, as far as they may be applicable, enjoined upon a receiver appointed by virtue of the law providing for suits by attachment. The receiver shall operate the utility so as to preserve the assets of the utility and to serve the best interests of its customers. The receiver shall be compensated from the assets of the utility in an amount to be determined by the court with the assistance of the commission staff. Any receiver or interim receiver appointed under this section shall be immune from personal liability for any civil damages arising from acts performed in his or her official capacity for actions for which the receiver or interim receiver would not otherwise be liable except for his or her affiliation with the utility. This immunity shall not, however, apply to intentional conduct, wanton or willful conduct, or gross negligence. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create or abolish an immunity in favor of the utility itself.\n\n7. Control of and responsibility for the utility shall remain in the receiver until the utility can, in the best interests of its customers, be returned to the owners. However, if the commission or another interested party petitions and the court determines, after hearing, that control of and responsibility for the utility should not, in the best interests of its customers, be returned to the owners, the court shall direct the receiver to transfer by sale or liquidate the assets of the utility in the manner provided by law.\n\n8. The appointment of a receiver or an interim receiver shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by law.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the requirement of section 386.600 to the contrary, penalties for violations of the public service commission law or related commission regulations that are collected from a sewer or water corporation that has been placed in receivership under the provisions of this section or for which the commission has appointed an interim receiver under the provisions of this section may, upon the order of the court that imposed the penalties, be used to support the operation of the subject small sewer or water corporation while it is under the control of the receiver.\n\n(L. 1991 H.B. 299 merged with S.B. 221, A.L. 2005 S.B. 462)\n\nEffective 6-29-05",

Acquisition of small water or sewer corporation by capable public utility, when — definitions — alternatives to be discussed, factors to consider — price for acquisition, how determined — plan for improvements required — rate case procedure to be used — rulemaking authority. —1. As used in this section the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Capable public utility\", a public utility that regularly provides the same type of service as a small water corporation or a small sewer corporation to more than eight thousand customer connections, that is not an affiliate of a small water corporation or a small sewer corporation, and that provides safe and adequate service; and shall not include a sewer district established pursuant to Article VI*, Section 30(a) of the Missouri Constitution, sewer districts established under the provisions of chapter 204, 249 or 250, public water supply districts established under the provisions of chapter 247, or municipalities that own and operate water or sewer systems;\n\n(2)\"Department\", the department of natural resources;\n\n(3)\"Small sewer corporation\", a public utility that regularly provides sewer service to eight thousand or fewer customer connections;\n\n(4)\"Small water corporation\", a public utility that regularly provides water service to eight thousand or fewer customer connections.\n\n2. The commission may order a capable public utility to acquire a small water or sewer corporation if, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission determines:\n\n(1) That the small water or sewer corporation is in violation of statutory or regulatory standards that affect the safety and adequacy of the service provided by the small water or sewer corporation, including but not limited to the public service commission law, the federal clean water law, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, and the regulations adopted under these laws; or\n\n(2) That the small water or sewer corporation has failed to comply, within a reasonable period of time, with any order of the department or the commission concerning the safety and adequacy of service, including but not limited to the availability of water, the potability of water, the palatability of water, the provision of water at adequate volume and pressure, the prevention of discharge of untreated or inadequately treated sewage to the waters of the state, and the prevention of environmental damage; or\n\n(3) That it is not reasonable to expect that the small water or sewer corporation will furnish and maintain safe and adequate service and facilities in the future; and\n\n(4) That the commission has considered alternatives to acquisition in accordance with subsection 3 of this section and has determined that they are impractical or not economically feasible; and\n\n(5) That the acquiring capable public utility is financially, managerially, and technically capable of acquiring and operating the small water or sewer corporation in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards.\n\n3. Except when there is an imminent threat of serious harm to life or property, before the commission may order the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation in accordance with subsection 2 of this section, the commission shall discuss alternatives to acquisition with the small water or sewer corporation and shall give such small water or sewer corporation thirty days to investigate alternatives to acquisition, including:\n\n(1) The reorganization of the small water or sewer corporation under new management;\n\n(2) The entering of a contract with another public utility or a management or service company to operate the small water or sewer corporation;\n\n(3) The merger of the small water or sewer corporation with one or more other public utilities; and\n\n(4) The acquisition of the small water or sewer corporation by a municipality, a municipal authority, a public water supply district, a public sewer district, or a cooperative.\n\n4. When the commission determines that there is an imminent threat of serious harm to life or property, the commission may appoint an interim receiver prior to the opportunity for hearing, provided that the commission shall provide opportunity for hearing as soon as practicable after the issuance of such order.\n\n5. In making a determination under subsection 2 of this section, the commission shall consider:\n\n(1) The financial, managerial, and technical ability of the small water or sewer corporation;\n\n(2) The financial, managerial, and technical ability of all proximate public utilities that provide the same type of service and constitute an alternative to acquisition;\n\n(3) The expenditures that are needed to improve the facilities of the small water or sewer corporation to assure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards concerning the adequacy, efficiency, safety, and reasonableness of utility service, and to sufficiently provide safe and adequate service to the customers of the small water or sewer corporation;\n\n(4) The potential for expansion of the certificated service area of the small water or sewer corporation; and\n\n(5) The opinion and advice, if any, of the department as to what steps may be necessary to assure compliance with applicable statutory or regulatory standards concerning the safety and adequacy of utility service.\n\n6. Subsequent to the determination required under subsection 2 of this section, the commission shall issue an order for the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation by a capable public utility. Such order shall include granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the acquiring capable public utility for the small water or sewer corporation's established service area.\n\n7. The price for the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation shall be determined by agreement between the small water or sewer corporation and the acquiring capable public utility, subject to a determination by the commission that the price is reasonable. If the small water or sewer corporation and the acquiring capable public utility are unable to agree on the acquisition price, or the commission disapproves the acquisition price to which the utilities agreed, the commission shall issue an order directing the acquiring capable public utility to acquire the small water or sewer corporation at an acquisition price that is equal to the ratemaking rate base as determined by the commission after notice and hearing, or providing that the acquiring capable public utility will not be allowed to earn a rate of return on the portion of the purchase price that is in excess of the ratemaking rate base determined by the commission after notice and hearing. The burden of establishing the ratemaking rate base shall be upon the small water or sewer corporation.\n\n8. Any capable public utility that is ordered by the commission to acquire a small water or sewer corporation shall, within thirty days after acquisition, submit a plan, including a timetable, for bringing the small water or sewer corporation into compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards to the commission for approval. The capable public utility shall also provide a copy of the plan to the department and such other state or local agency as the commission may direct. The commission shall give the department adequate opportunity to comment on the plan and shall consider any comments submitted by the department and shall expeditiously decide whether to approve the plan.\n\n9. Upon the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation by a capable public utility, and approval by the commission of a plan for improvements submitted under subsection 8 of this section, the acquiring capable public utility shall not be liable for any damages if the cause of those damages is proximately related to violations of applicable statutes or regulations by the small water or sewer corporation and the acquiring capable public utility remains in compliance with the plan for improvements submitted under subsection 8 of this section. This subsection shall not apply:\n\n(1) Beyond the end of the timetable in the plan for improvements;\n\n(2) Whenever the acquiring capable public utility is not in compliance with the plan for improvements; or\n\n(3) If, within sixty days after receipt of notice of the proposed plan for improvements, the department submitted written objections to the commission and those objections have not subsequently been withdrawn.\n\n10. Upon approval by the commission of a plan for improvements submitted under subsection 8 of this section, and the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation by a capable public utility, the acquiring capable utility shall not be subject to any enforcement actions by state or local agencies that had notice of the plan, if the basis of such enforcement action is proximately related to violations of applicable statutes or regulations by the small water or sewer corporation. This subsection shall not apply:\n\n(1) Beyond the end of the timetable in the plan for improvements;\n\n(2) Whenever the acquiring capable public utility is not in compliance with the plan for improvements;\n\n(3) If, within sixty days of having received notice of the proposed plan for improvements, the department submitted written objections to the commission and those objections have not subsequently been withdrawn; or\n\n(4) To emergency interim actions of the commission or the department, including but not limited to the ordering of boil-water advisories or other water supply warnings, of emergency treatment, or of temporary alternate supplies of water or sewer services.\n\n11. If the commission orders the acquisition of a small water or sewer corporation, the commission shall authorize the acquiring capable public utility to utilize the commission's small company rate case procedure for establishing the rates to be applicable to the system being acquired. Such rates may be designed to recover the costs of operating the acquired system and to recover one hundred percent of the revenues necessary to provide a net after-tax return on the ratemaking rate base value of the small water or sewer corporation's facilities acquired by the capable public utility, and the ratemaking rate base value of any improvements made to the facilities by the acquiring capable public utility subsequent to the acquisition, at a rate of return equivalent to one hundred basis points above the rate of return authorized for the acquiring capable public utility in its last general rate proceeding. The acquiring capable public utility may utilize the commission's small company rate case procedure for the purposes stated in this section until such time that a determination is made on the acquiring utility's next company-wide general rate increase, but not in excess of three years from the date of the acquisition of the subject small water or sewer corporation.\n\n12. Proceedings under this section may be initiated by complaint filed by the staff of the commission, the office of the public counsel, the mayor, or the president or chair of the board of aldermen, or a majority of the council, commission, or other legislative body of any city, town, village, or county within which the alleged unsafe or inadequate service is provided, or by not less than twenty-five consumers or purchasers, or prospective consumers or purchasers, of the utility service provided by a small water or sewer corporation. The complainant shall have the burden of proving that the acquisition of the small water or sewer corporation would be in the public interest and in compliance with the provisions of this section.\n\n13. The notice required by subsection 2 of this section, or any other provision of this section, shall be served upon the small water or sewer corporation affected, the office of the public counsel, the department, all proximate public utilities providing the same type of service as the small water or sewer corporation, all proximate municipalities and municipal authorities providing the same type of service as the small water or sewer corporation, and the municipalities served by the small water or sewer corporation. The commission shall order the affected small water or sewer corporation to provide notice to its customers of the initiation of proceedings under this section in the same manner in which the utility is required to notify its customers of proposed general rate increases.\n\n14. A public utility that would otherwise be a capable public utility except for the fact that it has fewer than eight thousand customer connections may petition the commission to be designated a capable public utility for the purposes of this section regardless of the number of its customer connections and regardless of whether it is proximate to the small water corporation or small water corporation to be acquired. The commission may grant such a petition upon finding that designating the petitioning public utility as a capable public utility is not detrimental to the public interest.\n\n15. Notwithstanding the requirement of section 386.600 to the contrary, penalties for violations of the public service commission law or related commission regulations that have been imposed on a small sewer or water corporation that has been placed in receivership under the provisions of section 393.145 may, upon the order of the court that imposed the penalties, be used to reduce the purchase price paid by a capable public utility for the acquisition of the assets of the subject small sewer or water corporation. In such a case, the commission shall make a corresponding reduction to the ratemaking rate base value of the subject assets for purposes of future ratemaking activities.\n\n16. The commission shall, no later than June 29, 2005, initiate a rulemaking, pursuant to the provisions of its internal rulemaking procedures, to promulgate rules to carry out the purposes of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028.

Commission may fix rates after hearing — stay increase — burden of proof — test year, procedure. —1. Whenever there shall be filed with the commission by any gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation any schedule stating a new rate or charge, or any new form of contract or agreement, or any new rule, regulation or practice relating to any rate, charge or service or to any general privilege or facility, the commission shall have, and it is hereby given, authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders without answer or other formal pleading by the interested gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the propriety of such rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice, and pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the commission upon filing with such schedule, and delivering to the gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation affected thereby, a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice, but not for a longer period than one hundred and twenty days beyond the time when such rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing, whether completed before or after the rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice goes into effect, the commission may make such order in reference to such rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after the rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice had become effective. In any proceeding under this section wherein testimony is prefiled, each party shall be afforded an opportunity to respond to any rebuttal testimony and exhibits of other parties through prefiled testimony.\n\n2. If any such hearing cannot be concluded within the period of suspension, as above stated, the commission may, in its discretion, extend the time of suspension for a further period not exceeding six months, the last day of which period shall be considered the operation of law date. At any hearing involving a rate sought to be increased, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or proposed increased rate is just and reasonable shall be upon the gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation, and the commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.\n\n3. (1) Beginning July 1, 2026, the test year for proceedings under this section shall, if requested by a gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation, be a future year consisting of the first twelve full calendar months after the operation of law date determined in subsections 1 and 2 of this section for schedules stating new base rates filed by a gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation under this section, unless the commission makes a determination that using a future test year under this section is detrimental to the public interest. For ratemaking purposes, the average of the projected month-end total rate base amount during the future test year shall be used to establish new base rates. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, new base rates shall not go into effect before the first day of the future test year.\n\n(2) With respect to gas corporations, water corporations, or sewer corporations that elect to utilize a future test year and notwithstanding section 393.270 to the contrary, within forty-five days of the end of the future test year, such gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation shall update its base rates that were approved by the commission in its report and order issued under subsections 1 and 2 of this section to reflect the total rate base, annualized depreciation expense, income tax expense, payroll expense, employee benefits (other than pensions and other post-retirement benefits), and rate case expense at the end of the future test year. The total ending rate base and expense items reflected in this update shall not be greater than the total ending rate base and expense items approved by the commission in its report and order establishing base rates. The commission and parties to the case shall have sixty days to review the updated information provided by a gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation, unless any party who was a party to the rate case files a request for a hearing at which point the commission shall suspend the filed tariffs and order a procedural schedule. The commission shall order the corporation to file new tariff sheets that reflect any update approved by the commission.\n\n4. A gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation that requests a test year under subsection 3 of this section shall not recover the costs of any plant investments made during the test year period under any of the mechanisms provided for in section*393.1000, 393.1003, 393.1006, 393.1009, 393.1012, 393.1015, 393.1500, 393.1503, 393.1506, or 393.1509.\n\n5. For a gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation that elected to use a future test year, a reconciliation of the rate base at the end of the future test year shall be provided to the commission within forty-five days of the end of the future test year. If the actual average month-end total rate base amount during the future test year is less than the average month-end total rate base amount used to set base rates in the prior general rate proceeding under subsections 1 and 2 of this section, and notwithstanding section 393.270 to the contrary, the portion of the annual revenue requirement comprising the average total rate base difference shall be returned to customers. The revenue requirement shall be calculated using rate base, depreciation expense, income tax expense, and the pretax rate of return from the prior general rate proceeding under subsections 1 and 2 of this section. The difference in revenue requirement shall be placed into a regulatory liability to be returned to customers in the next general rate proceeding with such regulatory liability to accrue carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost of capital.\n\n6. The commission may take into account any change in business risk to the corporation resulting from implementation of the adjustment mechanism in setting the corporation's allowed return in any rate proceeding, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the corporation.\n\n7. For a gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation that elected to use a future test year, a reconciliation of depreciation expense, income tax expense, payroll expense, employee benefits except for pensions and other postretirement benefits, and rate case expense incurred during the future test year shall be provided to the commission within forty-five days of the end of the future test year. If the actual amounts for these expenses are less than the amounts used to calculate the revenue requirement in the prior general rate proceeding under subsections 1 and 2 of this section, and notwithstanding section 393.270 to the contrary, the differences shall be returned to customers. The difference in revenue requirement shall be placed into a regulatory liability to be returned to customers in the next general rate case with such regulatory liability to accrue carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost of capital. Expense differences to be returned to customers resulting from this reconciliation shall not be used to offset additional capital spending in the reconciliation described in subsection 5 of this section.\n\n8. The commission shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section no later than July 1, 2027. Such rules shall include a procedure allowing any party to a rate proceeding that utilizes a future test year as provided in subsection 3 of this section to undertake a meaningful review of the update provided by the gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation under subsection 3 of this section and the reconciliations provided by the gas corporation, water corporation, or sewer corporation under subsections 5 and 7 of this section, and to argue for the disallowance of any costs included in the total rate base, depreciation expense, income tax expense, payroll expense, employee benefits (other than pensions and other postretirement benefits), and rate case expense at the end of the future test year that differs from the projected values upon which the commission relied in issuing its report and order to approve new base rates under subsections 1 and 2 of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n9. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Base rates\", rates or charges for public utility service other than rates or charges under any rate adjustment mechanism including, but not limited to, those approved under the provisions of sections 386.266, 393.1000, 393.1009, 393.1030, 393.1075, and 393.1500;\n\n(2)\"Revenue requirement\", the amount of retail revenues from base rates charged to retail customers for public utility service needed for a public utility to recover its cost to provide utility service including reasonable and necessary expenses, prudent investments, and the cost of capital.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 5647, A. 1949 H.B. 2165, A.L. 1967 p. 578, A.L. 2025 S.B. 4)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 5191; 1919 § 10479\n\n*Word \"sections\" appears in original rolls.\n\n(1976) Public service commission has power in proper case to grant interim rate increases, which power is implied in the \"file and suspend\" provision of statute.

It is the intent of the general assembly through the passage of this act*:\n\n(1) To maintain a fair and equitable tax structure and to preserve the local tax base by requiring all persons who provide electricity or gas service to pay an equitable share; and\n\n(2) To equalize the amount of business taxes, franchise fees and payments in lieu of taxes on competing suppliers of electricity and gas service.\n\n(3) To restore to political subdivisions revenue sources that existed prior to any previously implemented gas industry restructuring.\n\n(4) To remove disparities in the liability of natural gas suppliers for business taxes, franchise fees, and payments in lieu of taxes, which disparities have arisen as a result of any previously implemented gas industry restructuring.\n\n2. Political subdivisions provide police, fire and public health services, including the inspection of gas and electric equipment and other facilities used in the consumption of gas and electricity. Political subdivisions impose license taxes, franchise fees and sales taxes on providers of electricity and gas services, and require payments in lieu of taxes from publicly owned utilities in order to pay for these and other services related to the transportation, use and consumption of electricity and gas services and for the general operation of government.\n\n3. Missouri has historically restricted competition with respect to electricity and gas services by authorizing the Missouri public service commission to limit the number of providers and has allowed political subdivisions to require franchises for these services. Persons entering the gas and electric markets within Missouri receive substantial revenues from consumers in Missouri, thereby creating a purposeful economic presence in this state. In addition, these persons may also cause electricity and gas to be transported over rights-of-way and utility easements and may use electric lines or gas lines which are owned, controlled and maintained by other public and private entities in this state. Unless all participants in the electricity and gas markets pay comparable taxes and fees, there will be significant tax and franchise fee revenue losses by political subdivisions and unfair competitive disparities among such participants.\n\n4. The legislature finds that electricity and gas are essential, but potentially dangerous, commodities in modern society. The electricity transmission and distribution system is an interconnected and interdependent grid. Therefore, the legislature finds that it is in the interest of public health and safety to require registration of all sellers of electricity and gas for use or consumption within Missouri.\n\n5. It is not the intent of this act*to regulate the transportation of natural gas, methane, or propane in interstate commerce to the extent that such regulation is preempted by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n(L. 1998 S.B. 627)\n\nEffective 7-10-98\n\n*\"This act\" (S.B. 627, 1998) contained numerous sections.

Provision of energy services, limitations, exceptions — agreements with commission to pay business license taxes — nonseverability clause. —1. No person, other than a distributor or a political subdivision operating within its territorial limits, shall provide energy services in a political subdivision which has business license taxes in effect pursuant to section 66.300, section 71.610, section 92.045, section 94.110 or 94.360 on persons who sell energy services unless the person is certified by the commission as a seller and files its agreement with the commission to pay to the political subdivision all applicable business license taxes. All retail sales of energy shall be made by a distributor, seller or a political subdivision operating within its territorial limits. No distributor or political subdivision shall provide energy services to any person on behalf of any seller unless the seller has been certified as a seller and filed its agreement with the commission to pay all applicable business license taxes and the commission has furnished such distributor or political subdivision with evidence of such certification.\n\n2. No person shall provide energy services in a political subdivision if a franchise agreement is in effect between a distributor and a political subdivision with respect to energy services, or if the political subdivision owns the distribution system, unless (1) that person enters into an agreement with the political subdivision to pay its proportionate share of the franchise fee or the PILOT, which agreement shall be supplied to the distributor, or (2) the person obtains certification from the commission as a seller and files its agreement to pay the seller's proportionate share of any franchise fee or PILOT. No distributor or political subdivision shall provide energy services to any person on behalf of any seller if a franchise agreement is in effect between a distributor and a political subdivision for energy services, or if the political subdivision owns the distribution system, unless (1) that seller has entered into an agreement with the political subdivision to pay the seller's proportionate share of the franchise fee or the PILOT, or (2) the seller has obtained certification from the commission as a seller and files its agreement to pay the seller's proportionate share of any franchise fee or PILOT.\n\n3. An agreement described in subsections 1 and 2 of this section shall expressly state that the seller waives (1) its right to challenge the validity of the agreement and (2) its right to the refund of amounts paid pursuant to the agreement. Any person who otherwise has standing may challenge the validity of this section without signing such agreement by filing an action for a declaratory judgment in circuit court in the county in which the political subdivision is located. The agreement filed with the commission under subsections 1 and 2 of this section shall be limited solely to the requirements of this subsection and the seller's agreement to pay its taxes, its proportionate share of franchise fees or PILOT's and provisions which require the seller to make available to the political subdivision or the commission its records, including the right to audit.\n\n4. The commission shall establish procedures for certification pursuant to chapter 536.\n\n5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any seller the right to use the rights-of-way, utility easements or the distribution system of any distributor or political subdivision for any purpose other than to provide energy services to the seller's retail customers.\n\n6. Any agreement described in subsection 1 or 2 of this section shall cease to be effective upon the failure of the seller to fulfill any material obligation under the agreement. The appropriate political subdivision shall notify the commission of any failure to pay any amount required by any agreement described in subsection 1 or 2 of this section. Upon such notification, the commission shall immediately notify the seller which shall cease to provide energy services unless it requests a hearing with the commission within fifteen days of the date the notice is filed with the commission. Upon receiving notice from the seller requesting a hearing, the commission shall conduct a hearing to determine whether all material obligations under an agreement have been satisfied. If the commission determines that material obligations have not been satisfied, it shall notify the distributor, and the seller shall thereafter be prohibited from providing energy services from the date set forth in the notice, which shall not be less than thirty days after the commission makes its determination.

The procedures contained in this section may be chosen by a large water public utility, and if so chosen shall be used by the public service commission to establish the ratemaking rate base of a small water utility during an acquisition, provided that the public service commission independently concludes that a certificate of convenience and necessity should be granted pursuant to section 393.170. In making such determination, the commission may take into account rates that may result from such acquisition.\n\n3. (1) An appraisal shall be performed by no less than two appraisers. One appraiser shall be appointed by the small water utility, one appraiser shall be appointed by the large water public utility, and the third appraiser may be appointed by the public service commission.

The determination of fair market value shall be in accordance with Missouri law and with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice; and\n\n(b) Return only their final appraisal, in writing and at the same time, to the small water utility and large water public utility in a reasonable and timely manner. However, nothing shall prohibit the appraisers from issuing a corrected report if factual errors are identified subsequent to the issuance of the appraisal.\n\n(3) If all three appraisers cannot agree as to the appraised value, the appraisal, when signed by two of the appraisers, constitutes a good and valid appraisal.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a party from declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.\n\n5. (1) The lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value, together with the reasonable and prudent transaction, closing, and transition costs incurred by the large water public utility, shall constitute the ratemaking rate base for the small water utility as acquired by the acquiring large water public utility; provided, however, that if the small water utility is a public utility subject to chapter 386 and the small water utility completed a rate case prior to the acquisition, the public service commission may select as the ratemaking rate base for the small water utility as acquired by the acquiring large water public utility a ratemaking rate base in between:\n\n(a) The lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value, together with the reasonable and prudent transaction, closing, and transition costs incurred by the large water public utility unless such transaction, closing, and transition costs are elsewhere recoverable in rates; and\n\n(b) The ratemaking rate base of the small water utility as ordered by the public service commission in the small water utility's last previous rate case as adjusted by improvements and depreciation reserve since the previous rate case together with the transaction, closing, and transition costs incurred by the large water public utility unless such transaction, closing, and transition costs are elsewhere recoverable in rates. If the small water utility and large water public utility proceed with the sale, any past-due fees due to the state from the small water utility or its customers under chapter 640 or 644 shall be resolved prior to the transfer of ownership or the liability for such past-due fees becomes the responsibility of the large water public utility. Such fees shall not be included in the large water public utility's rate base.\n\n(2) The public service commission shall issue its decision establishing the ratemaking rate base of the small water utility in its order approving the acquisition. For any acquisition with an appraised value of five million dollars or less, such decision shall be issued within six months from the submission of the application by the large public water utility to acquire the small water utility.\n\n(3) Prior to the expiration of the six-month period, the public service commission staff or the office of public counsel may request, upon a showing of good cause, from the public service commission an extension for approval of the application for an additional thirty days.\n\n6. Upon the date of the acquisition of a small water utility by a large water public utility, whether or not the procedures for establishing ratemaking rate base provided by this section have been utilized, the small water utility shall, for ratemaking purposes, become part of an existing service area, as defined by the public service commission, of the acquiring large water public utility that is either contiguous to the small water utility, the closest geographically to the small water utility, or best suited due to operational or other factors. This consolidation shall be approved by the public service commission in its order approving the acquisition.\n\n7. Any new permit issued pursuant to chapters 640 and 644, when a small water utility is acquired by a large water public utility, shall include a plan to resolve all outstanding permit compliance issues. After the transfer of ownership, the acquiring large public water utility shall continue providing service to all customers that were served by the small water utility at the time of sale.\n\n8. This section is intended for the specific and unique purpose of determining the ratemaking rate base of small water utilities and shall be exclusively applied to large water public utilities in the acquisition of a small water utility. A large water public utility's choice to comply with the provisions of this section does not automatically ensure that the transaction is in the public interest. The public service commission shall independently determine whether the acquisition is in the public interest, regardless of whether the matter has been put to a vote of the small water utility's ratepayers. This section is not intended to apply beyond its specific purpose and shall not be construed in any manner to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, or any other utility regulated by the public service commission.\n\n9. The commission shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2010 S.B. 791, A.L. 2013 H.B. 142, A.L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

For purposes of this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Dispatchable power resource\", a source of electricity that is, under normal operating conditions, available for use on demand and that can have its power output adjusted according to market needs, except during routine maintenance and repair;\n\n(2)\"Electrical corporation\", the same as defined in section 386.020, but shall not include an electrical corporation as described in subsection 2 of section 393.110;\n\n(3)\"Existing electric generating power plant\", a thermal power plant of over one hundred megawatts in nameplate capacity, a generating unit at a thermal power plant with a nameplate capacity of over one hundred megawatts, or two or more generating units at a thermal power plant with a combined nameplate capacity of over one hundred megawatts;\n\n(4)\"Regional transmission operator\", a regional transmission organization, independent system operator, or equivalent entity approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or successor agency, that exercises functional control over electric transmission facilities located within this state;\n\n(5)\"Reliable electric generation\", electric generation meeting the accreditation requirements provided for in this section;\n\n(6)\"Unexpected or unplanned cause or event\", a natural disaster, physical sabotage, equipment failure or damage causing a forced prolonged outage, or an adverse decision of a court or a change in a state or federal law or regulation which causes the closure of an existing electric generating plant.\n\n2. Prior to the closure of an existing electric generating power plant in Missouri if the closure occurs on or after January 1, 2026, and subject to subsection 3 of this section, an electrical corporation registered and doing business in this state shall first certify to the public service commission that such utility company has secured and placed on the electric grid an equal or greater amount of reliable electric generation as accredited power resources based on the regional transmission operator's resource accreditation for the reliable electric generation technology at issue with consideration of the electrical corporation's anticipated loss of load, if any. To determine if an equal or greater amount of reliable electric generation is being placed on the electric grid to replace the existing electric generating power plant that is to be closed, the electrical corporation shall compare the relevant regional transmission operator's average of the summer and winter accredited capacity for the generation technology of the to-be-closed existing electric generating power plant to the relevant regional transmission operator's average of the summer and winter accredited capacity for the generation technology of the replacement reliable electric generation with consideration of the electrical corporation's anticipated loss of load, if any. Such average of the summer and winter accredited capacity for the replacement reliable electric generation shall equal or exceed such average of the summer and winter accredited capacity for the existing electric generating plant that is to be closed with consideration of the electrical corporation's anticipated loss of load, if any. Dispatchable power resources shall comprise at least eighty percent of the average of the summer and winter accredited capacity of the replacement reliable electric generation.\n\n3. With respect to the replacement reliable electric generation required by subsection 2 of this section, adequate electric transmission lines shall be in place and the replacement reliable electric generation shall be fully operational concurrently with the closure of the existing electric generating plant, except where some or all of the replacement reliable electric generation utilizes some or all of the interconnection facilities used by the existing electric generating power plant, or where the existing electric generating power plant is closed as a result of an unexpected or unplanned cause or event. In the event that some or all of the replacement reliable electric generation utilizes some or all of the interconnection facilities utilized by the existing electric generating power plant, then such replacement facilities shall be fully operational within one hundred eighty days of the closure of the existing electric generating power plant. In the event that the existing electric generating power plant is closed as a result of an unexpected or unplanned cause or event, then the following process shall apply:\n\n(1) Within one hundred twenty days after the event causing the closure occurs, the electrical corporation shall file an application with the commission outlining its plan to install replacement reliable electric generation. The application shall specify the generation technology the electrical corporation proposes to be used for the replacement, its estimated cost, and shall demonstrate that the replacement reliable electric generation's average accredited capacity is equal to or greater than the average accredited capacity of the closed plant according to the process outlined in subsection 2 of this section. The application under this section shall be submitted to the commission prior to the electrical corporation's filing of an application to the commission under subsection 1 of section 393.170. Within two hundred seventy days of the application's filing, the commission shall either approve or deny the electrical corporation's application.\n\n(2) Promptly after issuance of the commission's order under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the electrical corporation shall proceed and use all reasonable efforts to procure, build, and place into operation the approved alternative reliable generation. During any periods allowed by this subsection where the replacement reliable electric generation is not fully operational by the time of the closure of the existing electric generating power plant, the electrical corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to contract for or otherwise acquire additional available firm generating capacity in a quantity necessary to meet the planning reserve margin requirement of the regional transmission operator in which the electrical corporation operates without reliance on such replacement reliable electric generation. At such time as such replacement reliable electric generation is fully operational, such additional available firm generating capacity shall no longer be required under this section. An electrical corporation shall not enter into a voluntary or negotiated settlement with a third party that requires closure of an existing electric generating plant unless the electrical corporation determines that such a settlement is in the best interest of its customers and would maintain electric reliability. Electrical corporations shall not enter into such a settlement in order to meet pollution reduction or other corporate or societal goals beyond those required by law.\n\n4. (1) The average of the summer and winter accredited capacity of the replacement reliable electric generation determined in accordance with subsection 2 of this section shall be equal to or greater than the average summer and winter accredited capacity of the to-be-closed dispatchable existing electric generating power plant determined in accordance with subsection 2 of this section, using the regional transmission operator's resource accreditation as of the time of the electrical corporation's application to the commission under subsection 1 of section 393.170 with consideration of the electrical corporation's anticipated loss of load, if any.\n\n(2) The commission may consider information regarding anticipated loss of load submitted by the electrical corporation to the pertinent regional transmission operator for purposes of its long-term resource plans. As part of its approval of the replacement reliable electric generation under subsection 1 of section 393.170, the public service commission shall certify that the requirements of this subsection shall be met by the replacement reliable electric generation.\n\n(3) If information is submitted to the commission that the electrical corporation has experienced a significant and long-term loss of load, pursuant to this section, the commission, prior to a review of potential replacement reliable electric generation under subsection 1 of section 393.170, shall determine if the acquisition or construction of full replacement generation is in the public interest. If the commission determines that full replacement generation is not in the public interest, the requirements of subsection 2 of this section shall not apply.\n\n5. Such reliable electric generation may be constructed in Missouri or in a state that neighbors Missouri, if the generation is connected to the electric grid of the regional transmission operator of which the electrical corporation is a member or is located in a neighboring regional transmission operator which also operates in Missouri and shares a seam with that member's regional transmission operator.\n\n6. On or before the date that the new reliable electric generation is placed in service, the electrical corporation shall provide certification to the public service commission, the general assembly, and the governor that it has met the requirements of this section.\n\n7. To the extent existing electric generating power plant capacity is replaced pursuant to this section, such capacity shall not be replaced by replacement resources under section 393.1705.\n\n(L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

A water corporation may effectuate a change in its rate pursuant to this section no more often than two times every twelve months.\n\n4. In determining the appropriate pretax revenues, the commission shall consider only the following factors:\n\n(1) The current state, federal, and local income or excise tax rates;\n\n(2) The water corporation's actual regulatory capital structure as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water corporation;\n\n(3) The actual cost rates for the water corporation's debt and preferred stock as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water corporation;\n\n(4) The water corporation's cost of common equity as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water corporation;\n\n(5) The current property tax rate or rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system replacements;\n\n(6) The current depreciation rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system replacements;\n\n(7) In the event information called for in subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) is unavailable and the commission is not provided with such information on an agreed-upon basis, the commission shall refer to the testimony submitted during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water corporation and use, in lieu of any such unavailable information, the recommended capital structure, recommended cost rates for debt and preferred stock, and recommended cost of common equity that would produce the average weighted cost of capital based upon the various recommendations contained in such testimony.\n\n5. (1) An ISRS shall be calculated based upon the amount of ISRS costs that are eligible for recovery during the period in which the surcharge will be in effect and upon the applicable customer class billing determinants utilized in designing the water corporation's customer rates in its most recent general rate proceeding. The commission shall, however, only allow such surcharges to apply to classes of customers receiving a benefit from the subject water utility plant projects or shall prorate the surcharge according to the benefit received by each class of customers; provided that the ISRS shall be applied in a manner consistent with the customer class cost-of-service study recognized by the commission in the water corporation's most recent general rate proceeding, if applicable, and with the rate design methodology utilized to develop the water corporation's rates resulting from its most recent general rate proceeding.\n\n(2) At the end of each twelve-month calendar period that an ISRS is in effect, the water corporation shall reconcile the differences between the revenues resulting from an ISRS and the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period and shall submit the reconciliation and a proposed ISRS adjustment to the commission for approval to recover or refund the difference, as appropriate, through adjustment of an ISRS.\n\n6. (1) A water corporation that has implemented an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1000 to 393.1006 shall file revised rate schedules to reset the ISRS to zero when new base rates and charges become effective for the water corporation following a commission order establishing customer rates in a general rate proceeding that incorporates in the utility's base rates subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section eligible costs previously reflected in an ISRS.\n\n(2) Upon the inclusion in a water corporation's base rates subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section of eligible costs previously reflected in an ISRS, the water corporation shall immediately thereafter reconcile any previously unreconciled ISRS revenues as necessary to ensure that revenues resulting from the ISRS match as closely as possible the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period.\n\n7. A water corporation's filing of a petition to establish or change an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1000 to 393.1006 shall not be considered a request for a general increase in the water corporation's base rates and charges.\n\n8. Commission approval of a petition, and any associated rate schedules, to establish or change an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1000 to 393.1006 shall in no way be binding upon the commission in determining the ratemaking treatment to be applied to eligible infrastructure system replacements during a subsequent general rate proceeding when the commission may undertake to review the prudence of such costs. In the event the commission disallows, during a subsequent general rate proceeding, recovery of costs associated with eligible infrastructure system replacements previously included in an ISRS, the water corporation shall offset its ISRS in the future as necessary to recognize and account for any such overcollections.\n\n9.

Rate schedules, procedures to establish or change — prequalification process, requirements — report to general assembly. —1. Notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 386 and this chapter to the contrary, beginning August 28, 2003, a gas corporation providing gas service may file a petition and proposed rate schedules with the commission to establish or change ISRS rate schedules that will allow for the adjustment of the gas corporation's rates and charges to provide for the recovery of costs for eligible infrastructure system replacements. The commission may not approve an ISRS to the extent it would produce total annualized ISRS revenues below the lesser of one million dollars or one-half of one percent of the gas corporation's base revenue level approved by the commission in the gas corporation's most recent general rate proceeding. The commission may not approve an ISRS to the extent it would produce total annualized ISRS revenues exceeding ten percent of the gas corporation's base revenue level approved by the commission in the gas corporation's most recent general rate proceeding. An ISRS and any future changes thereto shall be calculated and implemented in accordance with the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015. ISRS revenues shall be subject to a refund based upon a finding and order of the commission to the extent provided in subsections 5 and 8 of section 393.1015.\n\n2. The commission shall not approve an ISRS for any gas corporation that has not had a general rate proceeding decided or dismissed by issuance of a commission order within the past three years, unless the gas corporation has filed for or is the subject of a new general rate proceeding.\n\n3. In no event shall a gas corporation collect an ISRS for a period exceeding three years unless the gas corporation has filed for or is the subject of a new general rate proceeding; provided that the ISRS may be collected until the effective date of new rate schedules established as a result of the new general rate proceeding, or until the subject general rate proceeding is otherwise decided or dismissed by issuance of a commission order without new rates being established.\n\n4. In order for a gas corporation to file a petition with the commission to establish or change an ISRS, such corporation shall, by July 1, 2021, develop and file with the commission a prequalification process for contractors seeking to participate in competitive bidding to install ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects. Under the prequalification process, the gas corporation may specify certain eligibility requirements typically accepted by the industry, including but not limited to, experience, performance criteria, safety policies, and insurance or indemnification requirements to be met by any contractor seeking to participate in competitive bidding to install ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects. Contractors that meet the prequalification criteria set by the gas corporation shall be eligible to participate in the competitive bidding process for installing ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects, with the winning bid awarded to the contractor making the overall lowest and best bid, as defined in subsection 2 of section 34.010. The gas corporation shall file, by January 1, 2022, a verified statement with the commission confirming that it has in place a prequalification process for the competitive bidding of ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects, and that such process conforms with the requirements of this section. The commission shall have the authority to verify the statement to ensure compliance with this section. After January 1, 2022, the gas corporation shall submit with each petition filing to establish or change an ISRS a verified statement confirming that it is using a competitive bidding process for no less than twenty-five percent of the combined external installation expenditures made by the gas corporation's operating units in Missouri for installing ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects, and that such process conforms with the requirements set forth in this section. The commission shall have the authority to verify the statement to ensure compliance with this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring any gas corporation to use a prequalified contractor or competitive bidding process in the case of an emergency project, or to terminate any existing contract with a contractor prior to its expiration; provided however, that the use of any preexisting contract for the installation of ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects shall not qualify as fulfilling the twenty-five percent requirement set forth in this section beyond December 31, 2022. For contractors not qualifying through the competitive bid process, the gas corporation, upon request from the contractor, shall provide information from the process in which the contractor can be informed as to how to be better positioned to qualify for such bid opportunities in the future.\n\n5. By December 31, 2023, and annually thereafter, the commission shall submit a report to the general assembly on the effects of subsection 4 of this section, including gas corporation compliance, potential legislative action regarding subsection 4 of this section, the costs of installing ISRS-eligible gas utility plant projects prior to the implementation of subsection 4 of this section compared to after the implementation of subsection 4 of this section, and any other information regarding the processes established under subsection 4 of this section that the commission deems necessary.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 208, A.L. 2020 H.B. 2120)\n\nExpires 8-28-29; see § 393.1015",

(1) At the time that a gas corporation files a petition with the commission seeking to establish or change an ISRS, it shall submit proposed ISRS rate schedules and its supporting documentation regarding the calculation of the proposed ISRS with the petition, and shall serve the office of the public counsel with a copy of its petition, its proposed rate schedules, and its supporting documentation.\n\n(2) Upon the filing of a petition, and any associated rate schedules, seeking to establish or change an ISRS, the commission shall publish notice of the filing.\n\n2. (1) When a petition, along with any associated proposed rate schedules, is filed pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015, the commission shall conduct an examination of the proposed ISRS.\n\n(2) The staff of the commission may examine information of the gas corporation to confirm that the underlying costs are in accordance with the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015, and to confirm proper calculation of the proposed charge, and may submit a report regarding its examination to the commission not later than ninety days after the petition is filed. No other revenue requirement or ratemaking issues may be examined in consideration of the petition or associated proposed rate schedules filed pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015.\n\n(3) The commission may hold a hearing on the petition and any associated rate schedules and shall issue an order to become effective not later than one hundred eighty days after the petition is filed.\n\n(4) If the commission finds that a petition complies with the requirements of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015, the commission shall enter an order authorizing the corporation to impose an ISRS that is sufficient to recover appropriate pretax revenue, as determined by the commission pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015.\n\n3. A gas corporation may effectuate a change in its rate pursuant to the provisions of this section no more often than two times every twelve months.\n\n4. In determining the appropriate pretax revenue, the commission shall consider only the following factors:\n\n(1) The current state, federal, and local income tax or excise rates;\n\n(2) The gas corporation's actual regulatory capital structure as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the gas corporation;\n\n(3) The actual cost rates for the gas corporation's debt and preferred stock as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the gas corporation;\n\n(4) The gas corporation's cost of common equity as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the gas corporation;\n\n(5) The current property tax rate or rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system replacements;\n\n(6) The current depreciation rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system replacements; and\n\n(7) In the event information pursuant to subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection is unavailable and the commission is not provided with such information on an agreed-upon basis, the commission shall refer to the testimony submitted during the most recent general rate proceeding of the gas corporation and use, in lieu of any such unavailable information, the recommended capital structure, recommended cost rates for debt and preferred stock, and recommended cost of common equity that would produce the average weighted cost of capital based upon the various recommendations contained in such testimony.\n\n5. (1) The monthly ISRS charge may be calculated based on a reasonable estimate of billing units in the period in which the charge will be in effect, which shall be conclusively established by dividing the appropriate pretax revenues by the customer numbers reported by the gas corporation in the annual report it most recently filed with the commission pursuant to subdivision (6) of section 393.140, and then further dividing this quotient by twelve. Provided, however, that the monthly ISRS may vary according to customer class and may be calculated based on customer numbers as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the gas corporation so long as the monthly ISRS for each customer class maintains a proportional relationship equivalent to the proportional relationship of the monthly customer charge for each customer class.\n\n(2) At the end of each twelve-month calendar period the ISRS is in effect, the gas corporation shall reconcile the differences between the revenues resulting from an ISRS and the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period and shall submit the reconciliation and a proposed ISRS adjustment to the commission for approval to recover or refund the difference, as appropriate, through adjustments of an ISRS charge.\n\n6. (1) A gas corporation that has implemented an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015 shall file revised rate schedules to reset the ISRS to zero when new base rates and charges become effective for the gas corporation following a commission order establishing customer rates in a general rate proceeding that incorporates in the utility's base rates subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section eligible costs previously reflected in an ISRS.\n\n(2) Upon the inclusion in a gas corporation's base rates subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section of eligible costs previously reflected in an ISRS, the gas corporation shall immediately thereafter reconcile any previously unreconciled ISRS revenues as necessary to ensure that revenues resulting from the ISRS match as closely as possible the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period.\n\n7. A gas corporation's filing of a petition or change to an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015 shall not be considered a request for a general increase in the gas corporation's base rates and charges.\n\n8. Commission approval of a petition, and any associated rate schedules, to establish or change an ISRS pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015 shall in no way be binding upon the commission in determining the ratemaking treatment to be applied to eligible infrastructure system replacements during a subsequent general rate proceeding when the commission may undertake to review the prudence of such costs. In the event the commission disallows, during a subsequent general rate proceeding, recovery of costs associated with eligible infrastructure system replacements previously included in an ISRS, the gas corporation shall offset its ISRS in the future as necessary to recognize and account for any such overcollections.\n\n9. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the commission to review and consider infrastructure system replacement costs along with other costs during any general rate proceeding of any gas corporation.\n\n10. Nothing contained in sections 393.1009 to 393.1015 shall be construed to impair in any way the authority of the commission to review the reasonableness of the rates or charges of a gas corporation, including review of the prudence of eligible infrastructure system replacements made by a gas corporation, pursuant to the provisions of section 386.390.\n\n11. The commission shall have authority to promulgate rules for the implementation of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015, but only to the extent such rules are consistent with, and do not delay the implementation of, the provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015.

Any gas corporation whose ISRS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to include unlawful and inappropriate charges shall refund every current customer of the gas corporation who paid such charges, before the gas corporation can file for a new ISRS.\n\n13. The provisions of sections 393.1009 to 393.1015 shall expire on August 28, 2029.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 208, A.L. 2020 H.B. 2120)\n\nExpires 8-28-29",

Electric utilities, portfolio requirements — tracking requirements — rebate offers — certification of electricity generated — rulemaking authority. —1. The commission shall, in consultation with the department, prescribe by rule a portfolio requirement for all electric utilities to generate or purchase electricity generated from renewable energy resources. Such portfolio requirement shall provide that electricity from renewable energy resources shall constitute the following portions of each electric utility's sales:\n\n(1) No less than two percent for calendar years 2011 through 2013;\n\n(2) No less than five percent for calendar years 2014 through 2017;\n\n(3) No less than ten percent for calendar years 2018 through 2020; and\n\n(4) No less than fifteen percent in each calendar year beginning in 2021.\n\n­­At least two percent of each portfolio requirement shall be derived from solar energy. The portfolio requirements shall apply to all power sold to Missouri consumers whether such power is self-generated or purchased from another source in or outside of this state. A utility may comply with the standard in whole or in part by purchasing RECs. Each kilowatt-hour of eligible energy generated in Missouri shall count as 1.25 kilowatt-hours for purposes of compliance.\n\n2. (1) This subsection applies to electric utilities with more than two hundred fifty thousand but less than one million retail customers in Missouri as of the end of the calendar year 2024.\n\n(2) Energy meeting the criteria of the renewable energy portfolio requirements set forth in subsection 1 of this section that is generated from renewable energy resources and contracted for by an accelerated renewable buyer shall:\n\n(a) Have all associated renewable energy certificates retired by the accelerated renewable buyer, or on their behalf, and the certificates shall not be used to meet the electric utility's portfolio requirements pursuant to subsection 1 of this section;\n\n(b) Be excluded from the total electric utility's sales used to determine the portfolio requirements pursuant to subsection 1 of this section; and\n\n(c) Be used to offset all or a portion of its electric load for purposes of determining compliance with the portfolio requirements pursuant to subsection 1 of this section.\n\n(3) The accelerated renewable buyer shall be exempt from any renewable energy standard compliance costs as may be established by the utility and approved by the commission, based on the amount of renewable energy certificates retired pursuant to this subsection in proportion to the accelerated renewable buyer's total electric energy consumption, on an annual basis.\n\n(4) An\"accelerated renewable buyer\"means a customer of an electric utility, with an aggregate load over eighty average megawatts, that enters into a contract or contracts to obtain:\n\n(a) Renewable energy certificates from renewable energy resources as defined in section 393.1025; or\n\n(b) Energy and renewable energy certificates from solar or wind generation resources located within the Southwest Power Pool region and initially placed in commercial operation after January 1, 2020, including any contract with the electric utility for such generation resources that does not allocate to or recover from any other customer of the utility the cost of such resources.\n\n(5) Each electric utility shall certify, and verify as necessary, to the commission that the accelerated renewable buyer has satisfied the exemption requirements of this subsection for each year, or an accelerated renewable buyer may choose to certify satisfaction of this exemption by reporting to the commission individually.\n\n(6) The commission may promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing or authorizing the imposition of any reporting, regulatory, or financial burden on an accelerated renewable buyer.\n\n3. The commission, in consultation with the department and within one year of November 4, 2008, shall select a program for tracking and verifying the trading of renewable energy credits. An unused credit may exist for up to three years from the date of its creation. A credit may be used only once to comply with sections 393.1020 to 393.1030 and may not also be used to satisfy any similar nonfederal requirement. An electric utility may not use a credit derived from a green pricing program. Certificates from net-metered sources shall initially be owned by the customer-generator. The commission, except where the department is specified, shall make whatever rules are necessary to enforce the renewable energy standard. Such rules shall include:\n\n(1) A maximum average retail rate increase of one percent determined by estimating and comparing the electric utility's cost of compliance with least-cost renewable generation and the cost of continuing to generate or purchase electricity from entirely nonrenewable sources, taking into proper account future environmental regulatory risk including the risk of greenhouse gas regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until June 30, 2020, if the maximum average retail rate increase would be less than or equal to one percent if an electric utility's investment in solar-related projects initiated, owned or operated by the electric utility is ignored for purposes of calculating the increase, then additional solar rebates shall be paid and included in rates in an amount up to the amount that would produce a retail rate increase equal to the difference between a one percent retail rate increase and the retail rate increase calculated when ignoring an electric utility's investment in solar-related projects initiated, owned, or operated by the electric utility. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this section, even if the payment of additional solar rebates will produce a maximum average retail rate increase of greater than one percent when an electric utility's investment in solar-related projects initiated, owned or operated by the electric utility are included in the calculation, the additional solar rebate costs shall be included in the prudently incurred costs to be recovered as contemplated by subdivision (4) of this subsection;\n\n(2) Penalties of at least twice the average market value of renewable energy credits for the compliance period for failure to meet the targets of subsection 1 of this section. An electric utility will be excused if it proves to the commission that failure was due to events beyond its reasonable control that could not have been reasonably mitigated, or that the maximum average retail rate increase has been reached. Penalties shall not be recovered from customers. Amounts forfeited under this section shall be remitted to the department to purchase renewable energy credits needed for compliance. Any excess forfeited revenues shall be used by the division of energy solely for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects;\n\n(3) Provisions for an annual report to be filed by each electric utility in a format sufficient to document its progress in meeting the targets;\n\n(4) Provision for recovery outside the context of a regular rate case of prudently incurred costs and the pass-through of benefits to customers of any savings achieved by an electrical corporation in meeting the requirements of this section.\n\n4. As provided for in this section, except for those electrical corporations that qualify for an exemption under section 393.1050, each electric utility shall make available to its retail customers a solar rebate for new or expanded solar electric systems sited on customers' premises, up to a maximum of twenty-five kilowatts per system, measured in direct current that were confirmed by the electric utility to have become operational in compliance with the provisions of section 386.890. The solar rebates shall be two dollars per watt for systems becoming operational on or before June 30, 2014; one dollar and fifty cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015; one dollar per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016; fifty cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017; fifty cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019; twenty-five cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020; and zero cents per watt for systems becoming operational after June 30, 2020. An electric utility may, through its tariffs, require applications for rebates to be submitted up to one hundred eighty-two days prior to the June thirtieth operational date. Nothing in this section shall prevent an electrical corporation from offering rebates after July 1, 2020, through an approved tariff. If the electric utility determines the maximum average retail rate increase provided for in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section will be reached in any calendar year, the electric utility shall be entitled to cease paying rebates to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum average retail rate increase if the electrical corporation files with the commission to suspend its rebate tariff for the remainder of that calendar year at least sixty days prior to the change taking effect. The filing with the commission to suspend the electrical corporation's rebate tariff shall include the calculation reflecting that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached and supporting documentation reflecting that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached. The commission shall rule on the suspension filing within sixty days of the date it is filed. If the commission determines that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached, the commission shall approve the tariff suspension. The electric utility shall continue to process and pay applicable solar rebates until a final commission ruling; however, if the continued payment causes the electric utility to pay rebates that cause it to exceed the maximum average retail rate increase, the expenditures shall be considered prudently incurred costs as contemplated by subdivision (4) of subsection 3 of this section and shall be recoverable as such by the electric utility. As a condition of receiving a rebate, customers shall transfer to the electric utility all right, title, and interest in and to the renewable energy credits associated with the new or expanded solar electric system that qualified the customer for the solar rebate for a period of ten years from the date the electric utility confirmed that the solar electric system was installed and operational.\n\n5. The department shall, in consultation with the commission, establish by rule a certification process for electricity generated from renewable resources and used to fulfill the requirements of subsection 1 of this section. Certification criteria for renewable energy generation shall be determined by factors that include fuel type, technology, and the environmental impacts of the generating facility. Renewable energy facilities shall not cause undue adverse air, water, or land use impacts, including impacts associated with the gathering of generation feedstocks. If any amount of fossil fuel is used with renewable energy resources, only the portion of electrical output attributable to renewable energy resources shall be used to fulfill the portfolio requirements.\n\n6. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the commission and the department shall include methane generated from the anaerobic digestion of farm animal waste and thermal depolymerization or pyrolysis for converting waste material to energy as renewable energy resources for purposes of this section.\n\n7. The commission shall have the authority to promulgate rules for the implementation of this section, but only to the extent such rules are consistent with, and do not delay the implementation of, the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2013, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 54, A.L. 2008 Adopted by Initiative, Proposition C, November 4, 2008, A.L. 2010 S.B. 795, A.L. 2013 H.B. 142, A.L. 2018 S.B. 975 & 1024 Revision, A.L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

Citation of law — definitions — policy to value demand-side investments equal to traditional investments — development of cost recovery mechanisms — costs not to be assigned to customers, when — rulemaking authority — annual report — certain charges to appear on bill. —1. This section shall be known as the \"Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act\".\n\n2. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Commission\", the Missouri public service commission;\n\n(2)\"Demand response\", measures that decrease peak demand or shift demand to off-peak periods;\n\n(3)\"Demand-side program\", any program conducted by the utility to modify the net consumption of electricity on the retail customer's side of the electric meter, including but not limited to energy efficiency measures, rate management, demand response, and interruptible or curtailable load;\n\n(4)\"Energy efficiency\", measures that reduce the amount of electricity required to achieve a given end use;\n\n(5)\"Interruptible or curtailable rate\", a rate under which a customer receives a reduced charge in exchange for agreeing to allow the utility to withdraw the supply of electricity under certain specified conditions;\n\n(6)\"Total resource cost test\", a test that compares the sum of avoided utility costs and avoided probable environmental compliance costs to the sum of all incremental costs of end-use measures that are implemented due to the program, as defined by the commission in rules.\n\n3. It shall be the policy of the state to value demand-side investments equal to traditional investments in supply and delivery infrastructure and allow recovery of all reasonable and prudent costs of delivering cost-effective demand-side programs. In support of this policy, the commission shall:\n\n(1) Provide timely cost recovery for utilities;\n\n(2) Ensure that utility financial incentives are aligned with helping customers use energy more efficiently and in a manner that sustains or enhances utility customers' incentives to use energy more efficiently; and\n\n(3) Provide timely earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective measurable and verifiable efficiency savings.\n\n4. The commission shall permit electric corporations to implement commission-approved demand-side programs proposed pursuant to this section with a goal of achieving all cost-effective demand-side savings. Recovery for such programs shall not be permitted unless the programs are approved by the commission, result in energy or demand savings and are beneficial to all customers in the customer class in which the programs are proposed, regardless of whether the programs are utilized by all customers. The commission shall consider the total resource cost test a preferred cost-effectiveness test. Programs targeted to low-income customers or general education campaigns do not need to meet a cost-effectiveness test, so long as the commission determines that the program or campaign is in the public interest. Nothing herein shall preclude the approval of demand-side programs that do not meet the test if the costs of the program above the level determined to be cost-effective are funded by the customers participating in the program or through tax or other governmental credits or incentives specifically designed for that purpose.\n\n5. To comply with this section the commission may develop cost recovery mechanisms to further encourage investments in demand-side programs including, in combination and without limitation: capitalization of investments in and expenditures for demand-side programs, rate design modifications, accelerated depreciation on demand-side investments, and allowing the utility to retain a portion of the net benefits of a demand-side program for its shareholders. In setting rates the commission shall fairly apportion the costs and benefits of demand-side programs to each customer class except as provided for in subsection 6 of this section. Prior to approving a rate design modification associated with demand-side cost recovery, the commission shall conclude a docket studying the effects thereof and promulgate an appropriate rule.\n\n6. The commission may reduce or exempt allocation of demand-side expenditures to low-income classes, as defined in an appropriate rate proceeding, as a subclass of residential service.\n\n7. Provided that the customer has notified the electric corporation that the customer elects not to participate in demand-side measures offered by an electrical corporation, none of the costs of demand-side measures of an electric corporation offered under this section or by any other authority, and no other charges implemented in accordance with this section, shall be assigned to any account of any customer, including its affiliates and subsidiaries, meeting one or more of the following criteria:\n\n(1) The customer has one or more accounts within the service territory of the electrical corporation that has a demand of five thousand kilowatts or more;\n\n(2) The customer operates an interstate pipeline pumping station, regardless of size; or\n\n(3) The customer has accounts within the service territory of the electrical corporation that have, in aggregate, a demand of two thousand five hundred kilowatts or more, and the customer has a comprehensive demand-side or energy efficiency program and can demonstrate an achievement of savings at least equal to those expected from utility-provided programs.\n\n8. Customers that have notified the electrical corporation that they do not wish to participate in demand-side programs under this section shall not subsequently be eligible to participate in demand-side programs except under guidelines established by the commission in rulemaking.\n\n9. Customers who participate in demand-side programs initiated after August 1, 2009, shall be required to participate in program funding for a period of time to be established by the commission in rulemaking.\n\n10. Customers electing not to participate in an electric corporation's demand-side programs under this section shall still be allowed to participate in interruptible or curtailable rate schedules or tariffs offered by the electric corporation.\n\n11. The commission shall provide oversight and may adopt rules and procedures and approve corporation-specific settlements and tariff provisions, independent evaluation of demand-side programs, as necessary, to ensure that electric corporations can achieve the goals of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2009, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12. Each electric corporation shall submit an annual report to the commission describing the demand-side programs implemented by the utility in the previous year. The report shall document program expenditures, including incentive payments, peak demand and energy savings impacts and the techniques used to estimate those impacts, avoided costs and the techniques used to estimate those costs, the estimated cost-effectiveness of the demand-side programs, and the net economic benefits of the demand-side programs.\n\n13. Charges attributable to demand-side programs under this section shall be clearly shown as a separate line item on bills to the electrical corporation's customers.\n\n14. The commission shall develop rules that provide for disclosure of participants in all demand-side programs offered by electrical corporations under this section when such programs provide monetary incentives to the customer. The disclosure required by this subsection may include, but not be limited to, the following: the name of the participant, or the names of the principals if for a company, the property address, and the amount of the monetary incentive received.\n\n(L. 2009 S.B. 376 § 393.1124, A.L. 2013 H.B. 142, A.L. 2017 S.B. 112)",

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, electrical corporations shall defer to a regulatory asset eighty-five percent of all depreciation expense and return associated with all qualifying electric plant recorded to plant-in-service on the utility's books commencing on or after August 28, 2018, if the electrical corporation has made the election provided for by subsection 5 of this section by that date, or on the date such election is made if the election is made after August 28, 2018. In each general rate proceeding concluded after August 28, 2018, the balance of the regulatory asset as of the rate-base cutoff date shall, subject only to the cap provided for in section 393.1655 or section 393.1656, as applicable, be included in the electrical corporation's rate base without any offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any other factor, other than as provided for in subdivision (2) of this subsection, with the regulatory asset balance arising from deferrals associated with qualifying electric plant placed in service after the rate-base cutoff date to be included in rate base in the next general rate proceeding. The expiration of this section shall not affect the continued inclusion in rate base and amortization of regulatory asset balances that arose under this section prior to such expiration.\n\n(2) The regulatory asset balances arising under this section shall be adjusted to reflect any prudence disallowances ordered by the commission. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect existing law respecting the burdens of production and persuasion in general rate proceedings for rate-base additions.\n\n(3) Parts of regulatory asset balances created under this section that are not yet being recovered through rates shall include carrying costs at the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital, plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes. Regulatory asset balances arising under this section and included in rate base shall be recovered in rates through a twenty-year amortization beginning on the date new rates reflecting such amortization take effect.\n\n3. (1) Depreciation expense deferred under this section shall account for all qualifying electric plant placed into service less retirements of plant replaced by such qualifying electric plant.\n\n(2) Return deferred under this section shall be determined using the weighted average cost of capital applied to the change in plant-related rate base caused by the qualifying electric plant, plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes. In determining the return deferred, the electrical corporation shall account for changes in all plant-related accumulated deferred income taxes and changes in accumulated depreciation, excluding retirements.\n\n4. Beginning February 28, 2019, and by each February twenty-eighth thereafter while the electrical corporation is allowed to make the deferrals provided for by subsection 2 of this section, electrical corporations that defer depreciation expense and return authorized under this section shall submit to the commission a five-year capital investment plan setting forth the general categories of capital expenditures the electrical corporation will pursue in furtherance of replacing, modernizing, and securing its infrastructure. The plan shall also include a specific capital investment plan for the first year of the five-year plan consistent with the level of specificity used for annual capital budgeting purposes. For each project in the specific capital investment plan on which construction commences on or after January first of the year in which the plan is submitted, and where the cost of the project is estimated to exceed twenty million dollars, the electrical corporation shall identify all costs and benefits that can be quantitatively evaluated and shall further identify how those costs and benefits are quantified. For any cost or benefit with respect to such a project that the electrical corporation believes cannot be quantitatively evaluated, the electrical corporation shall state the reasons the cost or benefit cannot be quantitatively evaluated, and how the electrical corporation addresses such costs and benefits when reviewing and deciding to pursue such a project. No such project shall be based solely on costs and benefits that the electrical corporation believes cannot be quantitatively evaluated. Any quantification for such a project that does not produce quantified benefits exceeding the costs shall be accompanied by additional justification in support of the project. For each of the first five years that an electrical corporation is allowed to make the deferrals provided for by subsection 2 of this section, the purchase and installation of smart meters shall constitute no more than six percent of the electrical corporation's total capital expenditures during any given year under the corporation's specific capital investment plan. At least twenty-five percent of the cost of the investments reflected in each year's capital investment plan, which for the purposes of this subsection shall exclude the costs of investments in new generating units and energy storage systems, shall be comprised of grid modernization projects, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) Increased use of digital information and controls technology to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid;\n\n(2) Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with full cybersecurity;\n\n(3) Deployment and integration of distributed resources and generation, including renewable resources;\n\n(4) Development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources, and energy-efficiency resources;\n\n(5) Deployment of smart technologies (real-time, automated, interactive technologies that optimize the physical operation of appliances and consumer devices) for metering, communications, concerning grid operations and status, and distribution automation;\n\n(6) Integration of smart appliances and devices;\n\n(7) Deployment and integration of advanced electricity storage and peak-shaving technologies, including plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and thermal storage air conditioning;\n\n(8) Provision of timely information and control options to consumer;\n\n(9) Development of standards for communication and interoperability of appliances and equipment connected to the electric grid, including the infrastructure serving the grid; and\n\n(10) Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriers to adoption of smart grid technologies, practices, and services.\n\n­­Project specific information need not be included for the five-year period covered by the plan. Within thirty days of the filing of any capital investment plan or annual update to an existing plan, the electrical corporation shall host a public stakeholder meeting to answer questions and receive feedback about the plan. After feedback is received, the electrical corporation shall file a notice with the commission of any modifications to the capital investment plan it has accepted. Changes to the plan, its implementation, or the level of investments made shall not constitute evidence of imprudence of the investments made under such plan. The submission of a capital investment plan under this section shall not affect in any way the commission's authority with respect to the grant or denial of a certificate of convenience and necessity under section 393.170. By February twenty-eighth following each year in which the electrical corporation submits a capital investment plan, the electrical corporation shall submit a report to the commission detailing actual capital investments made the previous year, the quantitatively evaluated benefits and costs generated by each of those investments that exceeded twenty million dollars, and any efficiencies achieved as a result of those investments.\n\n5. This section shall only apply to any electrical corporation that has filed a notice with the commission of the electrical corporation's election to make the deferrals for which this section provides. An electrical corporation may provide notice to the commission one time under this subsection if such corporation has applied to the commission under subsection 2 of section 386.266, provided the corporation shall not concurrently utilize deferrals under this subsection and the electric rate adjustments set forth in subsection 3 of section 386.266. An electrical corporation's election shall allow it to make the deferrals provided for by subsection 2 of this section until December 31, 2035. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, an electrical corporation may seek permission to continue to make the deferrals provided for by subsection 2 of this section for an additional five years beyond December 31, 2035, by filing an application with the commission seeking such permission by December 31, 2033, which application shall be ruled upon by the commission within one hundred eighty days after its filing. In deciding whether to grant such permission to continue the commission shall have the authority, consistent with its statutory authority outside this section, to consider such factors as in its judgment it deems necessary and may condition the permission on factors that are relevant to the deferrals authorized by subsection 2 of this section.

Notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 386 and this chapter to the contrary, a water or sewer corporation that provides water service to more than eight thousand customer connections, sewer service to more than eight thousand customer connections, or a combination of either to more than eight thousand customer connections may file a petition and proposed rate schedules with the commission to establish or change a WSIRA that will provide for the recovery of the appropriate pretax revenues associated with the eligible infrastructure system projects, less the appropriate pretax revenues associated with any retired utility plant that is being replaced by the eligible infrastructure system projects. The WSIRA shall not produce revenues in excess of fifteen percent of the water or sewer corporation's base revenue requirement approved by the commission in the water or sewer corporation's most recent general rate proceeding; provided, however, that neither WSIRA revenues attributable to replacement of customer-owned lead service lines, nor any reconciliation amounts described in subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of section 393.1509, shall count toward the program cap. The WSIRA and any future changes thereto shall be calculated and implemented in accordance with the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509. WSIRA revenues shall be subject to refund based upon a finding and order of the commission, to the extent provided in subsections 5 and 8 of section 393.1509.\n\n2. The commission shall not approve a WSIRA for a water or sewer corporation that has not had a general rate proceeding decided or dismissed by issuance of a commission order within the past three years of the filing of a petition pursuant to this section unless the water or sewer corporation has filed for or is the subject of a new general rate proceeding.\n\n3. In no event shall a water or sewer corporation collect a WSIRA for a period exceeding three years unless the water or sewer corporation has filed for or is the subject of a pending general rate proceeding; provided that the WSIRA may be collected until the effective date of new rate schedules established as a result of the new general rate proceeding or until the subject general rate proceeding is otherwise decided or dismissed by issuance of a commission order without new rates being established.\n\n4.

Filing of WSIRA petition, procedure — pretax revenues, considerations — calculation of WSIRA — revised schedule, when — commission authority — expiration date. —1. (1) At the time that a water or sewer corporation files a petition with the commission seeking to establish or change a WSIRA, it shall submit proposed WSIRA rate schedules and supporting documentation regarding the calculation of the proposed WSIRA with the petition and shall serve the office of the public counsel with a copy of its petition, its proposed WSIRA rate schedules, and its supporting documentation.\n\n(2) Upon the filing of a petition and any associated WSIRA rate schedules, seeking to establish or change a WSIRA, the commission shall publish notice of the filing.\n\n(3) Three months prior to a water or sewer corporation filing a petition to establish a WSIRA, it shall also file with the commission a five-year capital expenditure plan unless such a plan has already been submitted during the previous twelve months. Thereafter, the water or sewer corporation shall annually file with the commission a five-year capital expenditure plan by January thirty-first of each year the corporation is collecting revenues through a WSIRA. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the water or sewer corporation from prioritizing eligible infrastructure projects that coincide with public works projects.\n\n2. (1) When a petition, along with any associated proposed rate schedules, is filed pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509, the commission shall conduct an examination of the proposed WSIRA.\n\n(2) The staff of the commission may examine information of the water or sewer corporation to confirm that the underlying costs are in accordance with the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509, and to confirm proper calculation of the proposed WSIRA, and may submit a report regarding its examination to the commission not later than ninety days after the petition is filed. No other revenue requirement or ratemaking issues shall be examined in consideration of the petition or associated proposed WSIRA rate schedules filed pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509.\n\n(3) The commission may hold a hearing on the petition and any associated WSIRA rate schedule and shall issue an order to become effective not later than one hundred eighty days after the petition is filed.\n\n(4) If the commission finds that a petition complies with the requirements of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509, the commission shall enter an order authorizing the water or sewer corporation to implement a WSIRA that is sufficient to recover appropriate pretax revenues, as determined by the commission pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509.\n\n3. A water or sewer corporation may effectuate a change in its WSIRA pursuant to this section no more often than two times in every twelve-month period.\n\n4. In determining the appropriate pretax revenues, the commission shall consider only the following factors:\n\n(1) The current state, federal, and local income or excise tax rates, including any income tax deductions;\n\n(2) The water or sewer corporation's actual regulatory capital structure as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water or sewer corporation;\n\n(3) The actual cost rates for the water or sewer corporation's debt and preferred stock as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water or sewer corporation;\n\n(4) The water or sewer corporation's cost of common equity as determined during the most recent general rate proceeding of the water or sewer corporation;\n\n(5) The current property tax rate or rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system projects;\n\n(6) The current depreciation rates applicable to the eligible infrastructure system projects;\n\n(7) In the event information described in subdivisions (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection is unavailable and the commission is not provided with such information on an agreed-upon basis, the commission shall utilize the overall pretax weighted average cost of capital last authorized for the water or sewer corporation in a general rate proceeding regarding a WSIRA or an infrastructure system replacement surcharge under sections 393.1000 to 393.1006.\n\n5. (1) A WSIRA shall be calculated based upon the amount of infrastructure system project costs that are eligible for recovery during the period in which the WSIRA will be in effect and upon the applicable tariff rate group billing determinants utilized in designing the water or sewer corporation's customer rates in its most recent general rate proceeding and allocated in a manner consistent with the rate design methodology utilized to develop the water or sewer corporation's base rates resulting from its most recent general rate proceeding.\n\n(2) At the end of each twelve-month calendar period that a WSIRA is in effect, the water or sewer corporation shall reconcile the differences between the revenues resulting from a WSIRA and the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period and shall submit the reconciliation and a proposed WSIRA to the commission for approval to recover or credit the difference, as appropriate, through a WSIRA.\n\n6. (1) A water or sewer corporation that has implemented a WSIRA pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509 shall file revised WSIRA schedules to reset the WSIRA to zero when new base rates and charges become effective for the water or sewer corporation following a commission order establishing customer rates in a general rate proceeding that incorporates in the utility's base rates, subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section, eligible costs previously reflected in a WSIRA.\n\n(2) Upon the inclusion in a water or sewer corporation's base rates, subject to subsections 8 and 9 of this section, of eligible costs previously reflected in a WSIRA, the water or sewer corporation shall immediately thereafter reconcile any previously unreconciled WSIRA revenues as necessary to ensure that revenues resulting from the WSIRA match as closely as possible the appropriate pretax revenues as found by the commission for that period.\n\n7. A water or sewer corporation's filing of a petition to establish or change a WSIRA pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509 shall not be considered a request for a general increase in the water or sewer corporation's base rates and charges.\n\n8. Commission approval of a petition, and any associated rate schedules, to establish or change a WSIRA pursuant to the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509 shall in no way be binding upon the commission in determining the ratemaking treatment to be applied to eligible infrastructure system projects during a subsequent general rate proceeding when the commission may undertake to review the prudence of such costs. In the event the commission disallows, during a subsequent general rate proceeding, recovery of costs associated with eligible infrastructure system projects previously included in a WSIRA, the water or sewer corporation shall offset its WSIRA in the future as necessary to recognize and account for any such overcollections.\n\n9. Nothing contained in sections 393.1503 to 393.1509 shall be construed to impair in any way the authority of the commission to review the reasonableness of the rates or charges of a water or sewer corporation, including review of the prudence of eligible infrastructure system replacements made by a water or sewer corporation, pursuant to the provisions of section 386.390.\n\n10. The commission may take into account any change in business risk to the water or sewer corporation resulting from implementation of the WSIRA in setting the corporation's allowed return in a general rate proceeding in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the corporation.\n\n11. The commission shall have authority to promulgate rules for the implementation of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509, but only to the extent such rules are consistent with, and do not delay the implementation of, the provisions of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2021, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12. The provisions of sections 393.1500 to 393.1509 shall expire on December 31, 2031.\n\n(L. 2021 S.B. 44)\n\nExpires 12-31-31",

Subject to the limitations provided for in subsection 2 of this section, and upon proper application by an eligible customer prior to public announcement of a growth project, a new or existing account meeting the criteria in this subsection shall qualify for one of the discounts set forth in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection:\n\n(1) When the new load is reasonably projected to be at least three hundred kilowatts but not more than ten megawatts and have a load factor of at least forty-five percent, the discount shall equal thirty-five percent and shall apply for five years, provided that if it is expected as of the date the discount is to commence that a thirty-five percent discount would produce revenues from the applicant's total bill that would not exceed the electrical corporation's variable cost to serve the applicant's account or accounts that are to receive the discount, the discount shall be determined so that the percentage discount, rounded to the nearest one percent, is expected, as of the date the discount percentage is determined, to provide revenues equal to one hundred twenty percent of the electrical corporation's variable cost to serve the applicant's account or accounts that are to receive the discount;\n\n(2) When the new load is reasonably projected to be more than ten megawatts and have a load factor of at least fifty-five percent, the discount percentage, rounded to the nearest one percent, shall be determined such that the applicant's total bill is expected, as of the date the discount percentage is determined, to provide revenues equal to one hundred twenty percent of the electrical corporation's variable cost to serve the applicant's account or accounts that are to receive the discount. Such discount shall apply for ten years.\n\n­­For the purposes of this section, the variable cost to serve new load for purposes of establishing a discount under this section shall be determined using (a) the energy and capacity market prices that underlie the net base energy costs reflected in the revenue requirement from the electrical corporation's most recent general rate proceeding; (b) any operations and maintenance expenses that vary with respect to the total number of customers or load served by the electrical corporation, excluding operations and maintenance expenses associated with generating electricity; and (c) any other incremental costs to serve the customer.\n\n­­To obtain one of the discounts set forth in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the customer's load shall be incremental, net of any offsetting load reductions due to the termination of other accounts of the customer or an affiliate of the customer within twelve months prior to the commencement of service to the new load, the customer shall receive an economic development incentive from the local, regional, state, or federal government, or from an agency or program of any such government, in conjunction with the incremental load, and the customer shall meet the criteria set forth in the electrical corporation's economic development rider tariff sheet, as approved by the commission, that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n­­Unless otherwise provided for by the electrical corporation's tariff, the applicable discount shall be a percentage applied to all base-rate components of the bill. The discount shall be applied to such incremental load from the date when the meter has been permanently set until the date that such incremental load no longer meets the criteria required to qualify for the discount, as determined under the provisions of subsection 2 of this section. An eligible customer shall also receive a ten percent discount of all base-rate components of the bill applied to such incremental load for an additional one-year period beyond the period during which the applicable discount under subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection applies if the electrical corporation determines that the customer is taking service from an under-utilized circuit. The electrical corporation may include in its tariff additional or alternative terms and conditions to a customer's utilization of the discount, subject to approval of such terms and conditions by the commission. The customer, on forms supplied by the electrical corporation, shall apply for the applicable discount provided for by this subsection at least ninety days prior to the date the customer requests that the incremental demand receive one of the discounts provided for by this subsection and shall enter into a written agreement with the electrical corporation reflecting the discount percentages and other pertinent details. If the incremental demand is not separately metered, the electrical corporation's determination of the incremental demand shall control. The electrical corporation shall verify the customer's incremental demand annually to determine continued qualification for the applicable discount. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the cents-per-kilowatt-hour realization resulting from application of any discounted rates as calculated shall be higher than the electrical corporation's variable cost to serve such incremental demand and the applicable discounted rate also shall make a positive contribution to fixed costs associated with service to such incremental demand. If in a subsequent general rate proceeding the commission determines that application of a discounted rate is not adequate to cover the electrical corporation's variable cost to serve the accounts in question and provide a positive contribution to fixed costs then the commission shall increase the rate for those accounts prospectively to the extent necessary to do so.\n\n2. In each general rate proceeding concluded after August 28, 2022, the difference in revenues generated by applying the discounted rates provided for by this section and the revenues that would have been generated without such discounts shall not be imputed into the electrical corporation's revenue requirement. Instead, such revenue requirement shall be set using the revenues generated by such discounted rates and the impact of the discounts provided for by this section shall be allocated to all the electrical corporation's customer classes, including the classes with customers that qualify for discounts under this section through the application of a uniform percentage adjustment to the revenue requirement responsibility of all customer classes. To qualify for the discounted rates provided for in this section, customers shall meet the applicable criteria within twenty-four months of initially receiving discounts based on metering data for calendar months thirteen through twenty-four and annually thereafter. If such data indicates that the customer did not meet both of the three hundred kilowatt and forty-five percent load factor requirements for any applicable twelve-month period, it shall thereafter no longer qualify for a discounted rate. For customers receiving service under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section, if after the fourth year, the demand has not exceeded ten thousand kilowatts during any twelve-month period, the customer's qualification shall revert to subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of this section. The provisions of this section do not supersede or limit the ability of an electrical corporation to continue to utilize economic development or retention tariffs previously approved by the commission that are in effect on August 28, 2022. If, however, a customer is receiving any economic development or retention-related discounts as of the date it would otherwise qualify for a discount provided for by this section, the customer shall agree to relinquish the prior discount concurrently with the date it begins to receive a discount under this section; otherwise, the customer shall not be eligible to receive any discount under this section. Customer demand existing at the time the customer begins to receive discounted rates under this section shall not constitute incremental demand. The discounted rates provided for by this section apply only to base-rate components, with the charges or credits arising from any rate adjustment mechanism authorized by law to be applied to customers qualifying for discounted rates under this section in the same manner as such rate adjustments would apply in the absence of this section.\n\n3. For purposes of this section,\"electrical corporation\"shall mean the same as defined in section 386.020, but shall not include an electrical corporation as described in subsection 2 of section 393.110.\n\n4.

The discount shall be applied to such incremental load from the date when the meter has been permanently set until the date that such incremental load no longer meets the criteria required to qualify for the discount as determined under the provisions of subsection 2 of this section, or a maximum of four years. The gas corporation may include in its tariff additional or alternative terms and conditions to a customer's utilization of the discount, subject to approval of such terms and conditions by the commission. The customer, on forms supplied by the gas corporation, shall apply for the applicable discount provided for by this subsection at least ninety days prior to the date the customer requests that the incremental usage receive one of the discounts provided for by this subsection and shall enter into a written agreement with the gas corporation reflecting the discount percentages and other pertinent details prior to which no discount will be available. If the incremental usage is not separately metered, the gas corporation's determination of the incremental usage shall control. The gas corporation shall verify the customer's consumption annually to determine continued qualification for the applicable discount. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the cents-per-CCF realization resulting from application of any discounted rates as calculated shall be higher than the gas corporation's variable cost to serve such incremental usage and the applicable discounted rate also shall make a positive contribution to fixed costs associated with service to such incremental usage. If in a subsequent general rate proceeding the commission determines that application of a discounted rate is not adequate to cover the gas corporation's variable cost to serve the accounts in question and provide a positive contribution to fixed costs, then the commission shall reduce the discount for those accounts prospectively to the extent necessary to do so.\n\n2. In each general rate proceeding concluded after August 28, 2025, the difference in revenues generated by applying the discounted rates provided for by this section and the revenues that would have been generated without such discounts shall not be imputed into the gas corporation's revenue requirement, but instead such revenue requirement shall be set using the revenues generated by such discounted rates, and the impact of the discounts provided for by this section shall be allocated to all the gas corporation's customer classes, including the classes with customers that qualify for discounts under this section, through the application of a uniform percentage adjustment to the revenue requirement responsibility of all customer classes. To qualify for the discounted rates provided for in this section, customers shall meet the applicable criteria within twenty-four months of initially receiving discounts based on metering data for calendar months thirteen through twenty-four and annually thereafter. If such data indicates that the customer did not meet the applicable criteria for any subsequent twelve-month period, it shall thereafter no longer qualify for a discounted rate. Customer usage existing at the time the customer makes an application for discounted rates under this section shall not constitute incremental usage. The discounted rates provided for by this section apply only to variable base-rate components, with charges or credits arising from any rate adjustment mechanism authorized by law to be applied to customers qualifying for discounted rates under this section in the same manner as such rate adjustments would apply in absence of this section.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Gas corporation\", the same as defined in section 386.020;\n\n(2)\"Variable base-rate components\", the rate charged for gas service based on the volume of gas used excluding any additional riders or surcharges.\n\n(L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

Electrical corporations shall develop a qualification process and make such process open to all contractors seeking to provide construction and construction-related services for projects on the electrical corporation's distribution system. Contractors shall have the opportunity to register on the electrical corporation's vendor registration site and be evaluated for bid opportunities. Under the qualification process, electrical corporations may specify eligibility requirements typically accepted by the industry, including but not limited to, experience, performance criteria, safety policies, and insurance requirements to be met by any contractor seeking to participate in competitive bidding to provide construction and construction-related services for distribution system projects, and the electrical corporation shall not weight any contractor favorably or unfavorably due to affiliation with a labor organization or union, except if the work is being performed pursuant to a union-only project labor agreement which requires that participating contractors use union-represented labor. Contractors that meet the eligibility requirements set by electrical corporations shall be eligible to participate in the competitive bidding process for providing construction and construction-related services for distribution system projects, and the contractor making the lowest and best bid shall be awarded such contract.\n\n3. Within thirty days after August 28, 2018, electrical corporations shall file a verified statement with the commission confirming that they have established a qualification process for the competitive bidding of construction and construction-related services for distribution system projects, and that such process conforms with the requirements of this section.

Whenever the electrical corporation files a general rate proceeding, it shall submit concurrently with its submission of the rate schedules that initiate such general rate proceeding a verified statement confirming that it is using the qualification process for the competitive bidding of construction and construction-related services for distribution system projects required by this section for no less than ten percent of the combined external installation expenditures made by the electrical corporation's operating units in Missouri for construction and construction-related services for distribution system projects, and that such process conforms with the requirements set forth in this section to ensure compliance with this subsection.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring any electrical corporation to use a qualified contractor or competitive bidding process in the case of an emergency project, or to terminate any existing contract with a contractor prior to its expiration, provided that the use of any pre-existing contract for construction or construction-related services for distribution system projects shall not qualify as fulfilling the ten percent requirement set forth in subsection 3 of this section. For contractors not qualifying through the competitive bid process, the electrical corporation, upon request from the contractor, shall provide information from the process in which the contractor can be informed as to how to be better positioned to qualify for such bid opportunities in the future.\n\n5. By December 31, 2020, and annually thereafter, the commission shall submit a report to the general assembly on the effects of this section, including electrical corporation compliance, potential legislative action regarding this section, the costs of constructing distribution system projects prior to the implementation of this section compared to after the implementation of this section, and any other information regarding the processes established under this section that the commission deems necessary.\n\n(L. 2018 S.B. 564)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nNonseverability clause, 393.1675",

Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as otherwise provided for by this section, an electrical corporation's base rates shall be held constant for a period starting on the date new base rates were established in the electrical corporation's last general rate proceeding concluded prior to the date the electrical corporation gave notice under subsection 5 of section 393.1400 and ending on the third anniversary of that date, unless a force majeure event as determined by the commission occurs. Whether a force majeure event has occurred shall be subject to commission review and approval in a general rate proceeding, and shall not preclude the commission from reviewing the prudence of any revenue reductions or costs incurred during any proceeding to set rates. This subsection shall not affect the electrical corporation's ability to adjust its nonbase rates during the three-year period provided for in this subsection as authorized by its commission-approved rate adjustment mechanisms arising under section 386.266, 393.1030, or 393.1075, or as authorized by any other rate adjustment mechanism authorized by law.\n\n3.

If a change in any rates charged under a rate adjustment mechanism approved by the commission under sections 386.266 and 393.1030 would cause an electrical corporation's average overall rate to exceed the compound annual growth rate limitation set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of this section, the electrical corporation shall reduce the rates charged under that rate adjustment mechanism in an amount sufficient to ensure that the compound annual growth rate limitation set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of this section is not exceeded due to the application of the rate charged under such mechanism and the performance penalties under such subsections are not triggered. Sums not recovered under any such mechanism because of any reduction in rates under such a mechanism pursuant to this subsection shall be deferred to and included in the regulatory asset arising under section 393.1400 or, if applicable, under the regulatory and ratemaking treatment ordered by the commission under section 393.1400, and recovered through an amortization in base rates in the same manner as deferrals under that section or order are recovered in base rates.\n\n6.

Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

If certificates of participation or ownership are issued, references in this section to principal, interest, or premium shall be construed to refer to comparable amounts under those certificates;\n\n(16)\"Securitized utility tariff charge\", the amounts authorized by the commission to repay, finance, or refinance securitized utility tariff costs and financing costs and that are, except as otherwise provided for in this section, nonbypassable charges imposed on and part of all retail customer bills, collected by an electrical corporation or its successors or assignees, or a collection agent, in full, separate and apart from the electrical corporation's base rates, and paid by all existing or future retail customers receiving electrical service from the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees under commission-approved rate schedules, except for customers receiving electrical service under special contracts as of August 28, 2021, even if a retail customer elects to purchase electricity from an alternative electricity supplier following a fundamental change in regulation of public utilities in this state. Any customer receiving electrical service under a commission-approved market-based tariff with a load of at least eighty megawatts, where the servicing electrical corporation has a commission-approved market-based tariff as of the end of calendar year 2022, is exempt from any securitized utility tariff charges if the charge was approved by the commission prior to customer energization and from any future securitized utility tariff charges related to qualified extraordinary costs, concerning energy, if the customer directly incurred costs for its own energy through the commission-approved market-based tariff. No such exemption shall apply for electrical service that is not received by the customer under a commission-approved market-based tariff;\n\n(17)\"Securitized utility tariff costs\", either energy transition costs or qualified extraordinary costs as the case may be;\n\n(18)\"Securitized utility tariff property\", all of the following:\n\n(a) All rights and interests of an electrical corporation or successor or assignee of the electrical corporation under a financing order, including the right to impose, bill, charge, collect, and receive securitized utility tariff charges authorized under the financing order and to obtain periodic adjustments to such charges as provided in the financing order;\n\n(b) All revenues, collections, claims, rights to payments, payments, money, or proceeds arising from the rights and interests specified in the financing order, regardless of whether such revenues, collections, claims, rights to payment, payments, money, or proceeds are imposed, billed, received, collected, or maintained together with or commingled with other revenues, collections, rights to payment, payments, money, or proceeds;\n\n(19)\"Special contract\", electrical service provided under the terms of a special incremental load rate schedule at a fixed price rate approved by the commission.\n\n2. (1) An electrical corporation may petition the commission for a financing order to finance energy transition costs through an issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds. The petition shall include all of the following:\n\n(a) A description of the electric generating facility or facilities that the electrical corporation has retired or abandoned, or proposes to retire or abandon, prior to the date that all undepreciated investment relating thereto has been recovered through rates and the reasons for undertaking such early retirement or abandonment, or if the electrical corporation is subject to a separate commission order or proceeding relating to such retirement or abandonment as contemplated by subdivision (2) of this subsection, and a description of the order or other proceeding;\n\n(b) The energy transition costs;\n\n(c) An indicator of whether the electrical corporation proposes to finance all or a portion of the energy transition costs using securitized utility tariff bonds. If the electrical corporation proposes to finance a portion of the costs, the electrical corporation shall identify the specific portion in the petition. By electing not to finance all or any portion of such energy transition costs using securitized utility tariff bonds, an electrical corporation shall not be deemed to waive its right to recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the commission;\n\n(d) An estimate of the financing costs related to the securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\n(e) An estimate of the securitized utility tariff charges necessary to recover the securitized utility tariff costs and financing costs and the period for recovery of such costs;\n\n(f) A comparison between the net present value of the costs to customers that are estimated to result from the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the costs that would result from the application of the traditional method of financing and recovering the undepreciated investment of facilities that may become securitized utility tariff costs from customers. The comparison should demonstrate that the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition of securitized utility tariff charges are expected to provide quantifiable net present value benefits to customers;\n\n(g) A proposed future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences between securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds and the final securitized costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee provided that any such reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff bonds or the associated securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers; and\n\n(h) Direct testimony supporting the petition.\n\n(2) An electrical corporation may petition the commission for a financing order to finance qualified extraordinary costs. The petition shall include all of the following:\n\n(a) A description of the qualified extraordinary costs, including their magnitude, the reasons those costs were incurred by the electrical corporation and the retail customer rate impact that would result from customary ratemaking treatment of such costs;\n\n(b) An indicator of whether the electrical corporation proposes to finance all or a portion of the qualified extraordinary costs using securitized utility tariff bonds. If the electrical corporation proposes to finance a portion of the costs, the electrical corporation shall identify the specific portion in the petition. By electing not to finance all or any portion of such qualified extraordinary costs using securitized utility tariff bonds, an electrical corporation shall not be deemed to waive its right to reflect such costs in its retail rates pursuant to a separate proceeding with the commission;\n\n(c) An estimate of the financing costs related to the securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\n(d) An estimate of the securitized utility tariff charges necessary to recover the qualified extraordinary costs and financing costs and the period for recovery of such costs;\n\n(e) A comparison between the net present value of the costs to customers that are estimated to result from the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the costs that would result from the application of the customary method of financing and reflecting the qualified extraordinary costs in retail customer rates. The comparison should demonstrate that the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition of securitized utility tariff charges are expected to provide quantifiable net present value benefits to retail customers;\n\n(f) A proposed future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences between securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds and the final securitized costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee provided that any such reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff bonds or the associated securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers; and\n\n(g) Direct testimony supporting the petition.\n\n(3) (a) Proceedings on a petition submitted pursuant to this subsection begin with the petition by an electrical corporation and shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of this section and the rules of the commission, except as follows:\n\na. The commission shall establish a procedural schedule that permits a commission decision no later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed;\n\nb. No later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed, the commission shall issue a financing order approving the petition, an order approving the petition subject to conditions, or an order rejecting the petition; provided, however, that the electrical corporation shall provide notice of intent to file a petition for a financing order to the commission no less than sixty days in advance of such filing;\n\nc. Judicial review of a financing order may be had only in accordance with sections 386.500 and 386.510.\n\n(b) In performing its responsibilities under this section in approving, approving subject to conditions, or rejecting a petition for a financing order, the commission may retain counsel, one or more financial advisors, or other consultants as it deems appropriate. Such outside counsel, advisor or advisors, or consultants shall owe a duty of loyalty solely to the commission and shall have no interest in the proposed securitized utility tariff bonds. The costs associated with any such engagements shall be paid by the petitioning corporation and shall be included as financed costs in the securitized utility tariff charge and shall not be an obligation of the state and shall be assigned solely to the subject transaction. The commission may directly contract counsel, financial advisors, or other consultants as necessary for effectuating the purposes of this section. Such contracting procedures shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 34, however the commission shall establish a policy for the bid process. Such policy shall be publicly available and any information related to contracts under the established policy shall be included in publicly available rate case documentation.\n\n(c) A financing order issued by the commission, after a hearing, to an electrical corporation shall include all of the following elements:\n\na. The amount of securitized utility tariff costs to be financed using securitized utility tariff bonds and a finding that recovery of such costs is just and reasonable and in the public interest. The commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may be recovered through securitized utility tariff charges and specify the period over which securitized utility tariff costs and financing costs may be recovered;\n\nb. A finding that the proposed issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition and collection of a securitized utility tariff charge are just and reasonable and in the public interest and are expected to provide quantifiable net present value benefits to customers as compared to recovery of the components of securitized utility tariff costs that would have been incurred absent the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, in considering whether to find the proposed issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition and collection of a securitized utility tariff charge are just and reasonable and in the public interest, the commission may consider previous instances where it has issued financing orders to the petitioning electrical corporation and such electrical corporation has previously issued securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\nc. A finding that the proposed structuring and pricing of the securitized utility tariff bonds are reasonably expected to result in the lowest securitized utility tariff charges consistent with market conditions at the time the securitized utility tariff bonds are priced and the terms of the financing order;\n\nd. A requirement that, for so long as the securitized utility tariff bonds are outstanding and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of securitized utility tariff charges authorized under a financing order shall be nonbypassable and paid by all existing and future retail customers receiving electrical service from the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees under commission-approved rate schedules except for customers receiving electrical service under special contracts on August 28, 2021, even if a retail customer elects to purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier following a fundamental change in regulation of public utilities in this state. Any customer receiving electrical service under a commission-approved market-based tariff with a load of at least eighty megawatts, where the servicing electrical corporation has a commission-approved market-based tariff as of the end of calendar year 2022, is exempt from any securitized utility tariff charges if the charge was approved by the commission prior to customer energization and from any future securitized utility tariff charges related to qualified extraordinary costs, concerning energy, if the customer directly incurred costs for its own energy through the commission-approved market-based tariff. No such exemption shall apply for electrical service that is not received by the customer under a commission-approved market-based tariff;\n\ne. A formula-based true-up mechanism for making, at least annually, expeditious periodic adjustments in the securitized utility tariff charges that customers are required to pay pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely payment of securitized utility tariff bonds and financing costs and other required amounts and charges payable under the securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\nf. The securitized utility tariff property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an electrical corporation or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure securitized utility tariff bonds and approved financing costs;\n\ng. The degree of flexibility to be afforded to the electrical corporation in establishing the terms and conditions of the securitized utility tariff bonds, including, but not limited to, repayment schedules, expected interest rates, and other financing costs;\n\nh. How securitized utility tariff charges will be allocated among retail customer classes. The initial allocation shall remain in effect until the electrical corporation completes a general rate proceeding, and once the commission's order from that general rate proceeding becomes final, all subsequent applications of an adjustment mechanism regarding securitized utility tariff charges shall incorporate changes in the allocation of costs to customers as detailed in the commission's order from the electrical corporation's most recent general rate proceeding;\n\ni. A requirement that, after the final terms of an issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds have been established and before the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds, the electrical corporation determines the resulting initial securitized utility tariff charge in accordance with the financing order, and that such initial securitized utility tariff charge be final and effective upon the issuance of such securitized utility tariff bonds with such charge to be reflected on a compliance tariff sheet bearing such charge;\n\nj. A method of tracing funds collected as securitized utility tariff charges, or other proceeds of securitized utility tariff property, determining that such method shall be deemed the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any securitized utility tariff property subject to a financing order under applicable law;\n\nk. A statement specifying a future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences between the actual securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds and the final securitized utility tariff costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee provided that any such reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff bonds or the associated securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers;\n\nl. A procedure that shall allow the electrical corporation to earn a return, at the cost of capital authorized from time to time by the commission in the electrical corporation's rate proceedings, on any moneys advanced by the electrical corporation to fund reserves, if any, or capital accounts established under the terms of any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing documents pertaining to the securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\nm. In a financing order granting authorization to securitize energy transition costs or in a financing order granting authorization to securitize qualified extraordinary costs that include retired or abandoned facility costs, a procedure for the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes and excess deferred income taxes in connection with the retired or abandoned or to be retired or abandoned electric generating facility, or in connection with retired or abandoned facilities included in qualified extraordinary costs. The accumulated deferred income taxes, including excess deferred income taxes, shall be excluded from rate base in future general rate cases and the net tax benefits relating to amounts that will be recovered through the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds shall be credited to retail customers by reducing the amount of such securitized utility tariff bonds that would otherwise be issued. The customer credit shall include the net present value of the tax benefits, calculated using a discount rate equal to the expected interest rate of the securitized utility tariff bonds, for the estimated accumulated and excess deferred income taxes at the time of securitization including timing differences created by the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds amortized over the period of the bonds multiplied by the expected interest rate on such securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\nn. An outside date, which shall not be earlier than one year after the date the financing order is no longer subject to appeal, when the authority to issue securitized utility tariff bonds granted in such financing order shall expire; and\n\no. Include any other conditions that the commission considers appropriate and that are not inconsistent with this section.\n\n(d) A financing order issued to an electrical corporation may provide that creation of the electrical corporation's securitized utility tariff property is conditioned upon, and simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer of the securitized utility tariff property to an assignee and the pledge of the securitized utility tariff property to secure securitized utility tariff bonds.\n\n(e) If the commission issues a financing order, the electrical corporation shall file with the commission at least annually a petition or a letter applying the formula-based true-up mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make the applicable adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are any mathematical or clerical errors in the application of the formula-based true-up mechanism relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of securitized utility tariff charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition, defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in respect of securitized utility tariff bonds approved under the financing order. Within thirty days after receiving an electrical corporation's request pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall either approve the request or inform the electrical corporation of any mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the commission informs the electrical corporation of mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation, the electrical corporation shall correct its error and refile its request. The time frames previously described in this paragraph shall apply to a refiled request.\n\n(f) At the time of any transfer of securitized utility tariff property to an assignee or the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds authorized thereby, whichever is earlier, a financing order is irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based true-up mechanism authorized in this section, the commission may not amend, modify, or terminate the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust securitized utility tariff charges approved in the financing order. After the issuance of a financing order, the electrical corporation retains sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer securitized utility tariff property or to cause securitized utility tariff bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance.\n\n(g) The commission, in a financing order and subject to the issuance advice letter process under paragraph (h) of this subdivision, shall specify the degree of flexibility to be afforded the electrical corporation in establishing the terms and conditions for the securitized utility tariff bonds to accommodate changes in market conditions, including repayment schedules, interest rates, financing costs, collateral requirements, required debt service and other reserves and the ability of the electrical corporation, at its option, to effect a series of issuances of securitized utility tariff bonds and correlated assignments, sales, pledges, or other transfers of securitized utility tariff property. Any changes made under this paragraph to terms and conditions for the securitized utility tariff bonds shall be in conformance with the financing order.\n\n(h) As the actual structure and pricing of the securitized utility tariff bonds will be unknown at the time the financing order is issued, prior to the issuance of each series of bonds, an issuance advice letter shall be provided to the commission by the electrical corporation following the determination of the final terms of such series of bonds no later than one day after the pricing of the securitized utility tariff bonds. The commission shall have the authority to designate a representative or representatives from commission staff, who may be advised by a financial advisor or advisors contracted with the commission, to provide input to the electrical corporation and collaborate with the electrical corporation in all facets of the process undertaken by the electrical corporation to place the securitized utility tariff bonds to market so the commission's representative or representatives can provide the commission with an opinion on the reasonableness of the pricing, terms, and conditions of the securitized utility tariff bonds on an expedited basis. Neither the designated representative or representatives from the commission staff nor one or more financial advisors advising commission staff shall have authority to direct how the electrical corporation places the bonds to market although they shall be permitted to attend all meetings convened by the electrical corporation to address placement of the bonds to market. The form of such issuance advice letter shall be included in the financing order and shall indicate the final structure of the securitized utility tariff bonds and provide the best available estimate of total ongoing financing costs. The issuance advice letter shall report the initial securitized utility tariff charges and other information specific to the securitized utility tariff bonds to be issued, as the commission may require. Unless an earlier date is specified in the financing order, the electrical corporation may proceed with the issuance of the securitized utility tariff bonds unless, prior to noon on the fourth business day after the commission receives the issuance advice letter, the commission issues a disapproval letter directing that the bonds as proposed shall not be issued and the basis for that disapproval. The financing order may provide such additional provisions relating to the issuance advice letter process as the commission considers appropriate and as are not inconsistent with this section.\n\n(4) (a) In performing the responsibilities of this section in connection with the issuance of a financing order, approving the petition, an order approving the petition subject to conditions, or an order rejecting the petition, the commission shall undertake due diligence as it deems appropriate prior to the issuance of the order regarding the petition pursuant to which the commission may request additional information from the electrical corporation and may engage one or more financial advisors, one or more consultants, and counsel as the commission deems necessary. Any financial advisor or advisors, counsel, and consultants engaged by the commission shall have a fiduciary duty with respect to the proposed issuance of securitized utility bonds solely to the commission. All expenses associated with such services shall be included as part of the financing costs of the securitized utility tariff bonds and shall be included in the securitized utility tariff charge.\n\n(b) If an electrical corporation's petition for a financing order is denied or withdrawn, or for any reason securitized utility tariff bonds are not issued, any costs of retaining one or more financial advisors, one or more consultants, and counsel on behalf of the commission shall be paid by the petitioning electrical corporation and shall be eligible for full recovery, including carrying costs, if approved by the commission in the electrical corporation's future rates.\n\n(5) At the request of an electrical corporation, the commission may commence a proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or refunding securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in this section for a financing order. Effective upon retirement of the refunded securitized utility tariff bonds and the issuance of new securitized utility tariff bonds, the commission shall adjust the related securitized utility tariff charges accordingly.\n\n(6) (a) A financing order remains in effect and securitized utility tariff property under the financing order continues to exist until securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all commission-approved financing costs of such securitized utility tariff bonds have been recovered in full.\n\n(b) A financing order issued to an electrical corporation remains in effect and unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings, merger, or sale of the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees.\n\n3. (1) The commission may not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties regarding any matter within its authority, consider the securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to a financing order to be the debt of the electrical corporation other than for federal and state income tax purposes, consider the securitized utility tariff charges paid under the financing order to be the revenue of the electrical corporation for any purpose, consider the securitized utility tariff costs or financing costs specified in the financing order to be the costs of the electrical corporation, nor may the commission determine any action taken by an electrical corporation which is consistent with the financing order to be unjust or unreasonable, and section 386.300 shall not apply to the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds.\n\n(2) Securitized utility tariff charges shall not be utilized or accounted for in determining the electrical corporation's average overall rate, as defined in section 393.1655 and as used to determine the maximum retail rate impact limitations provided for by subsections 3 and 4 of section 393.1655.\n\n(3) No electrical corporation is required to file a petition for a financing order under this section or otherwise utilize this section. An electrical corporation's decision not to file a petition for a financing order under this section shall not be admissible in any commission proceeding nor shall it be otherwise utilized or relied on by the commission in any proceeding respecting the electrical corporation's rates or its accounting, including, without limitation, any general rate proceeding, fuel adjustment clause docket, or proceedings relating to accounting authority, whether initiated by the electrical corporation or otherwise. The commission may not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electrical corporation to use securitized utility tariff bonds to recover securitized utility tariff costs or to finance any project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other expenditure.\n\n(4) The commission may not refuse to allow an electrical corporation to recover securitized utility tariff costs in an otherwise permissible fashion, or refuse or condition authorization or approval of the issuance and sale by an electrical corporation of securities or the assumption by the electrical corporation of liabilities or obligations, because of the potential availability of securitized utility tariff bond financing.\n\n(5) After the issuance of a financing order with or without conditions, the electrical corporation retains sole discretion regarding whether to cause the securitized utility tariff bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale, assignment, transfer, or issuance. Nothing shall prevent the electrical corporation from abandoning the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds under the financing order by filing with the commission a statement of abandonment and the reasons therefor; provided, that the electrical corporation's abandonment decision shall not be deemed imprudent because of the potential availability of securitized utility tariff bond financing; and provided further, that an electrical corporation's decision to abandon issuance of such bonds may be raised by any party, including the commission, as a reason the commission should not authorize, or should modify, the rate-making treatment proposed by the electrical corporation of the costs associated with the electric generating facility that was the subject of a petition under this section that would have been securitized as energy transition costs had such abandonment decision not been made, but only if the electrical corporation requests nonstandard plant retirement treatment of such costs for rate-making purposes.\n\n(6) The commission may not, directly or indirectly, utilize or consider the debt reflected by the securitized utility tariff bonds in establishing the electrical corporation's capital structure used to determine any regulatory matter, including but not limited to the electrical corporation's revenue requirement used to set its rates.\n\n(7) The commission may not, directly or indirectly, consider the existence of securitized utility tariff bonds or the potential use of securitized utility tariff bond financing proceeds in determining the electrical corporation's authorized rate of return used to determine the electrical corporation's revenue requirement used to set its rates.\n\n4. The electric bills of an electrical corporation that has obtained a financing order and caused securitized utility tariff bonds to be issued shall comply with the provisions of this subsection; however, the failure of an electrical corporation to comply with this subsection does not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, securitized utility tariff property, securitized utility tariff charge, or securitized utility tariff bonds. The electrical corporation shall do the following:\n\n(1) Explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on such bill represents securitized utility tariff charges approved in a financing order issued to the electrical corporation and, if the securitized utility tariff property has been transferred to an assignee, shall include a statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to securitized utility tariff charges and that the electrical corporation or other entity, if applicable, is acting as a collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers shall indicate the securitized utility tariff charge and the ownership of the charge;\n\n(2) Include the securitized utility tariff charge on each customer's bill as a separate line item and include both the rate and the amount of the charge on each bill.\n\n5. (1) (a) All securitized utility tariff property that is specified in a financing order constitutes an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of securitized utility tariff charges depends on the electrical corporation, to which the financing order is issued, performing its servicing functions relating to the collection of securitized utility tariff charges and on future electricity consumption. The property exists:\n\na. Regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the property have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected; and\n\nb. Notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the property is dependent on the future provision of service to customers by the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers.\n\n(b) Securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing order exists until securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all financing costs and other costs of such securitized utility tariff bonds have been recovered in full.\n\n(c) All or any portion of securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing order issued to an electrical corporation may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a successor or assignee that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the electrical corporation and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering securitized utility tariff property or issuing securitized utility tariff bonds under the financing order. All or any portion of securitized utility tariff property may be pledged to secure securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale, conveyance, assignment, grant of a security interest in or pledge of securitized utility tariff property by an electrical corporation, or an affiliate of the electrical corporation, to an assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, does not require the prior consent and approval of the commission.\n\n(d) If an electrical corporation defaults on any required remittance of securitized utility tariff charges arising from securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues arising from the securitized utility tariff property to the financing parties or their assignees. Any such financing order remains in full force and effect notwithstanding any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees.\n\n(e) The interest of a transferee, purchaser, acquirer, assignee, or pledgee in securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing order issued to an electrical corporation, and in the revenue and collections arising from that property, is not subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the electrical corporation or any other person or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electrical corporation or any other entity.\n\n(f) Any successor to an electrical corporation, whether pursuant to any reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electrical corporation restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have the same rights under a financing order as, the electrical corporation under the financing order in the same manner and to the same extent as the electrical corporation, including collecting and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds of the securitized utility tariff property. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or impair any authority of the commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of public utilities.\n\n(g) Securitized utility tariff bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the electrical corporation other than the securitized utility tariff property as specified in the financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.\n\n(2) (a) The creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of any security interest in securitized utility tariff property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and other amounts payable in respect of securitized utility tariff bonds, amounts payable under any ancillary agreement and other financing costs are governed by this section and not by the provisions of the code, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(b) A security interest in securitized utility tariff property is created, valid, and binding at the later of the time:\n\na. The financing order is issued;\n\nb. A security agreement is executed and delivered by the debtor granting such security interest;\n\nc. The debtor has rights in such securitized utility tariff property or the power to transfer rights in such securitized utility tariff property; or\n\nd. Value is received for the securitized utility tariff property.\n\n­­The description of securitized utility tariff property in a security agreement is sufficient if the description refers to this section and the financing order creating the securitized utility tariff property. A security interest shall attach as provided in this paragraph without any physical delivery of collateral or other act.\n\n(c) Upon the filing of a financing statement with the office of the secretary of state as provided in this section, a security interest in securitized utility tariff property shall be perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the person granting the security interest, and regardless of whether the parties have notice of the security interest. Without limiting the foregoing, upon such filing a security interest in securitized utility tariff property shall be perfected against all claims of lien creditors, and shall have priority over all competing security interests and other claims other than any security interest previously perfected in accordance with this section.\n\n(d) The priority of a security interest in securitized utility tariff property is not affected by the commingling of securitized utility tariff charges with other amounts. Any pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all securitized utility tariff charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the qualifying electrical corporation in which securitized utility tariff charges have been commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party.\n\n(e) No application of the formula-based true-up mechanism as provided in this section will affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of securitized utility tariff property.\n\n(f) If a default occurs under the securitized utility tariff bonds that are secured by a security interest in securitized utility tariff property, the financing parties or their representatives may exercise the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the code, including the rights and remedies available under part 6 of article 9 of the code. The commission may also order amounts arising from securitized utility tariff charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the circuit court for the county or city in which the electrical corporation's headquarters is located shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the securitized utility tariff charges.\n\n(3) (a) Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of securitized utility tariff property shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of, and not a pledge of or secured transaction relating to, the seller's right, title, and interest in, to, and under the securitized utility tariff property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of an interest in securitized utility tariff property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser, regardless of whether the purchaser has possession of any documents evidencing or pertaining to the interest. A sale or similar outright transfer of an interest in securitized utility tariff property may occur only when all of the following have occurred:\n\na. The financing order creating the securitized utility tariff property has become effective;\n\nb. The documents evidencing the transfer of securitized utility tariff property have been executed by the assignor and delivered to the assignee; and\n\nc. Value is received for the securitized utility tariff property.\n\n­­After such a transaction, the securitized utility tariff property is not subject to any claims of the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest in the securitized utility tariff property perfected in accordance with this section.\n\n(b) The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute transfer and true sale and the corresponding characterization of the property interest of the purchaser shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:\n\na. Commingling of securitized utility tariff charges with other amounts;\n\nb. The retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity interest, in the securitized utility tariff property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of securitized utility tariff charges;\n\nc. Any recourse that the purchaser may have against the seller;\n\nd. Any indemnification rights, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by the seller;\n\ne. The obligation of the seller to collect securitized utility tariff charges on behalf of an assignee;\n\nf. The transferor acting as the servicer of the securitized utility tariff charges or the existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electrical corporation, to the extent that any interest in securitized utility tariff property is sold or assigned, to contract with the assignee or any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the securitized utility tariff charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;\n\ng. The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;\n\nh. The granting or providing to bondholders a preferred right to the securitized utility tariff property or credit enhancement by the electrical corporation or its affiliates with respect to such securitized utility tariff bonds;\n\ni. Any application of the formula-based true-up mechanism as provided in this section.\n\n(c) Any right that an electrical corporation has in the securitized utility tariff property before its pledge, sale, or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order is property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in securitized utility tariff property to an assignee is enforceable only upon the later of:\n\na. The issuance of a financing order;\n\nb. The assignor having rights in such securitized utility tariff property or the power to transfer rights in such securitized utility tariff property to an assignee;\n\nc. The execution and delivery by the assignor of transfer documents in connection with the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds; and\n\nd. The receipt of value for the securitized utility tariff property.\n\n­­An enforceable transfer of an interest in securitized utility tariff property to an assignee is perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when a notice of that transfer has been given by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with subsection 7 of this section. The transfer is perfected against third parties as of the date of filing.\n\n(d) The priority of a transfer perfected under this section is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order or securitized utility tariff property or by the commingling of funds arising from securitized utility tariff property with other funds. Any other security interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under this section, is terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If securitized utility tariff property has been transferred to an assignee or financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or financing party.\n\n(e) The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights in any securitized utility tariff property is determined as follows:\n\na. Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees rank according to priority in time of perfection. Priority dates from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in accordance with subsection 7 of this section;\n\nb. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee;\n\nc. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a person who becomes a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.\n\n6. The description of securitized utility tariff property being transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or other transfer agreement, granted or pledged to a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or indicated in any financing statement is only sufficient if such description or indication refers to the financing order that created the securitized utility tariff property and states that the agreement or financing statement covers all or part of the property described in the financing order. This section applies to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or security interests in, securitized utility tariff property, regardless of whether the related sale agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document was entered into, or any financing statement was filed.\n\n7. The secretary of state shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect a sale or other transfer of securitized utility tariff property and any security interest in securitized utility tariff property under this section in the same manner that the secretary of state maintains financing statements filed under the code to perfect a security interest in collateral owned by a transmitting utility. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all financing statements filed pursuant to this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding financing statements and the filing thereof under the code, including part 5 of article 9 of the code. A security interest in securitized utility tariff property may be perfected only by the filing of a financing statement in accordance with this section, and no other method of perfection shall be effective. Notwithstanding any provision of the code to the contrary, a financing statement filed pursuant to this section is effective until a termination statement is filed under the code, and no continuation statement need be filed to maintain its effectiveness. A financing statement filed pursuant to this section may indicate that the debtor is a transmitting utility, and without regard to whether the debtor is an electrical corporation, an assignee or otherwise qualifies as a transmitting utility under the code, but the failure to make such indication shall not impair the duration and effectiveness of the financing statement.\n\n8. The law governing the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or creation of a security interest in any securitized utility tariff property shall be the laws of this state.\n\n9. Neither the state nor its political subdivisions are liable on any securitized utility tariff bonds, and the bonds are not a debt or a general obligation of the state or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, nor are they special obligations or indebtedness of the state or any agency or political subdivision. An issue of securitized utility tariff bonds does not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the state or any agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the state to levy any tax or make any appropriation for payment of the securitized utility tariff bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of electricity. All securitized utility tariff bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: \"Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Missouri is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.\".\n\n10. All of the following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds in securitized utility tariff bonds:\n\n(1) Subject to applicable statutory restrictions on state or local investment authority, the state, units of local government, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers, except for members of the commission, the commission's technical advisory and other staff, or employees of the office of the public counsel;\n\n(2) Banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business;\n\n(3) Personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries;\n\n(4) All other persons authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of a similar nature.\n\n11. (1) The state and its agencies, including the commission, pledge and agree with bondholders, the owners of the securitized utility tariff property, and other financing parties that the state and its agencies will not take any action listed in this subdivision. This subdivision does not preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for the full protection of the securitized utility tariff charges collected pursuant to a financing order and of the bondholders and any assignee or financing party entering into a contract with the electrical corporation. The prohibited actions are as follows:\n\n(a) Alter the provisions of this section, which authorize the commission to create an irrevocable contract right or chose in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create securitized utility tariff property, and make the securitized utility tariff charges imposed by a financing order irrevocable, binding, or nonbypassable charges for all existing and future retail customers of the electrical corporation except its existing special contract customers;\n\n(b) Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of securitized utility tariff property or the security for the securitized utility tariff bonds or revises the securitized utility tariff costs for which recovery is authorized;\n\n(c) In any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, assignees, and other financing parties;\n\n(d) Except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based true-up mechanism authorized under this section, reduce, alter, or impair securitized utility tariff charges that are to be imposed, billed, charged, collected, and remitted for the benefit of the bondholders, any assignee, and any other financing parties until any and all principal, interest, premium, financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be performed, in connection with the related securitized utility tariff bonds have been paid and performed in full.\n\n(2) Any person or entity that issues securitized utility tariff bonds may include the language specified in this subsection in the securitized utility tariff bonds and related documentation.\n\n12. An assignee or financing party is not an electrical corporation or person providing electric service by virtue of engaging in the transactions described in this section.\n\n13. If there is a conflict between this section and any other law regarding the attachment, assignment, or perfection, or the effect of perfection, or priority of, assignment or transfer of, or security interest in securitized utility tariff property, this section shall govern.\n\n14. If any provision of this section is held invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires for any reason, that occurrence does not affect the validity of any action allowed under this section which is taken by an electrical corporation, an assignee, a financing party, a collection agent, or a party to an ancillary agreement; and any such action remains in full force and effect with respect to all securitized utility tariff bonds issued or authorized in a financing order issued under this section before the date that such provision is held invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, or repealed, or expires for any reason.\n\n(L. 2021 H.B. 734, A.L. 2025 S.B. 4)",

Replacement resources investment — petition, approval, amount — base determination — deferrals — petition procedure. —1. For purposes of this section, the term\"replacement resources\"shall mean:\n\n(1) Renewable generation facilities which produce electric energy from wind, solar thermal sources, photovoltaic cells and panels, dedicated crops grown for energy production, cellulosic agricultural residues, plant residues, methane from landfills, from agricultural operations, or from wastewater treatment, thermal depolymerization or pyrolysis for converting waste material to energy, clean and untreated wood such as pallets, hydropower, not including pumped storage, that does not require a new diversion or impoundment of water and that has a nameplate rating of ten megawatts or less, and fuel cells using hydrogen produced by one of the above-named replacement sources;\n\n(2) Generation facilities which produce electric energy from natural gas that enable the electrical corporation to:\n\n(a) Provide electric energy when renewable generation facilities and energy storage facilities are insufficient to meet the needs of the electrical corporation's system;\n\n(b) Meet requirements of the electrical corporation's regional transmission organization; or\n\n(c) Serve the objectives of both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision;\n\n(3) Energy storage facilities that enable the electrical corporation to:\n\n(a) Provide electric energy when renewable generation facilities are not generating electric energy in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the electrical corporation's system;\n\n(b) Meet requirements of the electrical corporation's regional transmission organization; or\n\n(c) Serve the objectives of both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision; and\n\n(4) Transmission facilities that enable the delivery of electric energy from renewable generation facilities or energy storage facilities, including but not limited to, interconnection, network upgrades, voltage and reactive power support, and transmission facilities needed to maintain reliability as a result of the retirement of generation facilities.\n\n2. If requested by an electrical corporation in a petition filed concurrently with a petition filed under subsection 2 of section 393.1700 to recover securitized utility tariff costs and notwithstanding any other provision of chapter 386 or this chapter to the contrary, including section 393.170 which section shall not apply to the construction of replacement resources as defined in subsection 1 of this section:\n\n(1) Except for electric generating facilities retired or abandoned prior to August 28, 2021, unless the commission issues an order rejecting a petition for a financing order filed under the provisions of section 393.1700 that was accompanied by a petition for approval of investment in replacement resources filed under the provisions of this section, the commission shall approve investment in replacement resources by the electrical corporation of an amount that is approximately equal to the undepreciated investment in the electric generating facilities covered by such petition to acquire or build an existing or new replacement resource to replace the retired or abandoned or to be retired or abandoned unit. There is no requirement that the replacement resource's capacity or energy production match the energy or capacity production of the retired or abandoned unit. Such approval shall constitute an affirmative and binding determination by the commission, to be applied in all subsequent proceedings respecting the rates of the electrical corporation, that such investment is prudent and reasonable, that the replacement resource is necessary for the electrical corporation's provision of electric service to its customers, and that such investment shall be reflected in the revenue requirement used to set the electrical corporation's base rates, subject only to the commission's authority to determine that the electrical corporation did not manage or execute the project in a reasonable and prudent manner in some respect and its authority to disallow for ratemaking purposes only that portion of the investment that would not have been incurred had the unreasonable or imprudent management or execution of the project not occurred; and\n\n(2) The commission shall create a deferral mechanism by which the electrical corporation shall defer, to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability as appropriate, the changes in the electrical corporation's revenue requirement used to last set its base rates as specified in this subdivision. Such changes shall be deferred during the period starting on the date of retirement or abandonment of the subject unit and ending when the base rates of the electrical corporation that is the subject of the petition are changed as the result of a general rate proceeding where the rate base cutoff date in that general rate proceeding occurs on or after the retirement or abandonment. For purposes of this subdivision, the changes in the electrical corporation's revenue requirement that shall be deferred shall only consist of:\n\n(a) Changes in depreciation expense associated with the retired or abandoned unit;\n\n(b) Changes in labor and benefit costs for employees or contractors no longer employed or retained by the electrical corporation who formerly worked at the retired or abandoned unit, net of severance and relocation costs of the electrical corporation paid to such employees or contractors;\n\n(c) Changes in nonlabor, nonfuel operations, and maintenance costs caused by the retirement or abandonment of the unit;\n\n(d) The return on the retired or abandoned unit once it is removed from plant-in-service on the electrical corporation's books at the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital, plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes, used to establish the electrical corporation's revenue requirement last used to set its base rates;\n\n(e) Depreciation expense on the replacement resources starting with the date it is recorded to plant-in-service on the electrical corporation's books;\n\n(f) Labor and benefits costs for employees or contractors who work at the replacement resources;\n\n(g) Nonlabor, nonfuel operations, and maintenance costs of the replacement resources; and\n\n(h) The return on the replacement resources once they are recorded to plant-in-service on the electrical corporation's books at the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital, plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes, used to establish the electrical corporation's revenue requirement last used to set its base rates.\n\n­­The base against which changes under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subdivision shall be the values of each such item used to set the electrical corporation's base electric rates in its last general rate proceeding concluded prior to the time the deferrals are made, provided, if the docketed record in such general rate proceeding does not specify one or more necessary revenue requirement parameters to establish the base for paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subdivision because of a black box settlement or otherwise, the commission shall, in the docket created by a petition filed under this section and based on the docketed record in such prior general rate proceeding, establish the missing parameters, which shall then be used to accomplish the deferrals. The base with respect to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this subdivision shall be zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, deferrals created by this subdivision shall cease on the effective date of rates from a base rate case that shall be filed no later than one year after the subject electric generating unit was retired or abandoned. For purposes of this subdivision, the return in paragraphs (d) and (h) shall equal the weighted average cost of capital used to set the electrical corporation's base electrical rates in its last general rate proceeding concluded prior to the time the deferrals are made, provided, if the docketed record in such general rate proceeding does not specify one or more necessary revenue requirement parameters to establish the base for an item because of a black box settlement or otherwise, the commission shall, in the docket created by a petition filed under this section and based on the docketed record in such general rate proceeding, establish the missing parameters, which shall then be used to accomplish the deferrals;\n\n(3) The commission shall also create a deferral mechanism by which the electrical corporation shall defer to a regulatory asset the changes in the electrical corporation's revenue requirement last used to set its base rates as specified in this subdivision. Such changes shall be deferred during the period beginning on the date deferrals cease under subdivision (2) of this subsection and ending when the electrical corporation's base rates are next changed as a result of a general rate proceeding. For purposes of this subdivision, such changes in the electrical corporation's revenue requirement that shall be deferred shall only consist of:\n\n(a) Return on the replacement resources once they go into service on the electrical corporation's books at the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital, plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes, used to establish the electrical corporation's revenue requirement last used to set its base rates;\n\n(b) Depreciation expense on the replacement resources starting with the date the replacement resource is recorded to plant in-service on the electrical corporation's books;\n\n(c) Increase in-labor and benefits costs for employees or contractors who work at the replacement resources; and\n\n(d) Increase in nonlabor, nonfuel operations, and maintenance costs of the replacement resources.\n\n­­Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, deferrals to the regulatory asset created by this subdivision shall cease at the earlier of the date the electrical corporation's base rates are first changed after the replacement resource is recorded to plant in service on the electrical corporation's books where the rate base cutoff date in that general rate proceeding occurred on or after the retirement or abandonment, or the effective date of rates from a base rate case that shall be filed no later than one year after the unit was retired or abandoned. If there is more than one replacement resource for the retired or abandoned plant and if one or more such replacement resource is placed in service prior to the rate base cutoff date in the general rate proceeding described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the deferrals called for under this subdivision shall be reduced as needed to reflect that event. The base with respect to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subdivision shall be zero. For purposes of this subdivision, the return in paragraph (a) shall equal the weighted average cost of capital used to set the electrical corporation's base electric rates in its last general rate proceeding concluded prior to the time the deferrals are made, provided, if the docketed record in such general rate proceeding does not specify one or more necessary revenue requirement parameters to establish the base for an item because of a black box settlement or otherwise, the commission shall, in the docket created by a petition filed under this section and based on the docketed record in such prior general rate proceeding, establish the missing parameters, which shall then be used to accomplish the deferrals;\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 393.1400 to the contrary, a replacement resource shall not constitute qualifying electric plant for purposes of section 393.1400, nor shall it constitute a renewable energy resource under section 393.1030, during the period when a deferral is occurring under subdivision (2) or (3) of this subsection. In addition, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 393.1400 to the contrary, deferrals required by this section relating to the electrical corporation's undepreciated investment in the retired or abandoned unit shall not constitute a change in accumulated depreciation when determining the return deferred on qualifying electric plant under section 393.1400;\n\n(5) Parts of regulatory asset or liability balances created under this section that are not yet being recovered or returned through rates shall include carrying costs at the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital last used to set its base electric service rates or, if such cost of capital was not specified for the revenue requirement last used to set such electric service rates at the weighted average cost of capital determined by the commission under subdivision (3) of this subsection, in each case plus applicable federal, state, and local income or excise taxes. All regulatory asset or liability balances from deferrals under this subsection shall be recovered in base rates over a period equal to the remaining useful life of the replacement resource;\n\n(6) In each general rate proceeding concluded after a deferral commences under subdivision (2) or (3) of this subsection, the regulatory asset or liability balances arising from such deferrals, as of the rate base cutoff date, shall be included in the electrical corporation's rate base without any offset, reduction, or adjustment based upon consideration of any other factor, other than to reflect any prudence disallowances ordered by the commission, with the regulatory asset balances arising from such deferrals that occur after the rate base cutoff date to be included in rate base in the next general rate proceeding. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect existing law respecting burdens of production and persuasion in general rate proceedings.\n\n3. Proceedings on a petition submitted pursuant to this section begin with the filing of a petition by an electrical corporation under this section that is filed concurrently with a petition submitted under section 393.1700, and shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of chapter*386 and this chapter and the rules of the commission, except as follows:\n\n(1) The commission shall establish a procedural schedule that permits a commission decision no later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed. Such procedural schedule adopted by the commission in connection with a petition filed under this section shall contain the same milestones and requirements as the procedural schedule adopted in a proceeding seeking approval of a financing order under section 393.1700 and shall run concurrently therewith;\n\n(2) No later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed, the commission shall issue an order approving the petition or, if it also rejects the accompanying petition for a financing order filed under section 393.1700, rejecting the petition. Judicial review may be had only in accordance with sections 386.500 and 386.510.\n\n(L. 2021 H.B. 734)\n\n*Word \"chapters\" appears in original rolls.",

Retirement of generating facilities, ratemaking principles and treatment as applied to base rates, retirement date, useful life, and depreciation — procedure — monitoring — coal-fixed generating assets in rate base — rulemaking authority. —1. An electrical corporation may petition the commission for a determination of the ratemaking principles and treatment, as proposed by the electrical corporation, that will apply to the reflection in base rates of the electrical corporation's capital and noncapital costs associated with the proposed retirement of one or more of the electrical corporation's generating facilities. Without limiting the foregoing, such principles and treatment may also establish the retirement date and useful life parameters used to set depreciation rates for such facilities. Except as provided for in subsection 4 of this section, the ratemaking principles and treatment approved by the commission under this section for such facilities shall apply to the determination of the revenue requirement in each of the electrical corporation's post-determination general rate proceedings until such time as such facility is fully depreciated on the electrical corporation's books.\n\n2.

(1) An electrical corporation with ratemaking principles and treatment approved by the commission, or deemed to have been approved under subsection 2 of this section, shall monitor the major factors and circumstances relating to the facility to which such principles and treatment apply. Such factors and circumstances include, but are not limited to:\n\n(a) Terrorist activity or an act of God;\n\n(b) A significant change in federal or state tax laws;\n\n(c) A significant change in federal utility laws or regulations or a significant change in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\n(d) An unexpected, extended outage or shutdown of a major generating unit, other than any major generating unit shut down due to an extended outage at the time of the approval of the ratemaking principles and treatment;\n\n(e) A significant change in the cost or reliability of power generation technologies;\n\n(f) A significant change in fuel prices and wholesale electric market conditions;\n\n(g) A significant change in the cost or effectiveness of emission control technologies;\n\n(h) A significant change in the price of emission allowances;\n\n(i) A significant change in the electrical corporation's load forecast;\n\n(j) A significant change in capital market conditions;\n\n(k) A significant change in the scope or effective dates of environmental regulations; or\n\n(l) A significant change in federal or state environmental laws.\n\n(2) If the electrical corporation determines that one or more major factor or circumstance has changed in a manner that warrants a change in the approved ratemaking principles and treatment, then it shall file a notice in the docket in which the approved ratemaking principles and treatment were established within forty-five days of any such determination. In its notification, the electrical corporation shall:\n\n(a) Explain and specify the changes it contends are appropriate to the ratemaking principles and treatment and the reasons for the proposed changes;\n\n(b) Provide a description of the alternatives that it evaluated and the process that it went through in developing its proposed changes; and\n\n(c) Provide detailed workpapers that support the evaluation and the process whereby proposed changes were developed.\n\n(3) If a party has concerns regarding the proposed changes, that party shall file a notice of its concerns within thirty days of the electrical corporation's filing. If the parties agree on a resolution of the concerns, the agreement shall be submitted to the commission for approval. If the parties do not reach agreement on changes to the ratemaking principles and treatment within ninety days of the date the electrical corporation filed its notice, whether the previously approved ratemaking and treatment will be changed shall be determined by the commission. If a party to the docket in which the approved ratemaking principles and treatment were approved believes that one or more major factor or circumstance has changed in a manner that warrants a change in the approved ratemaking principles and treatment and if the electrical corporation does not agree the principles and treatment should be changed, such party shall file a notice in the docket in which the approved ratemaking principles and treatment were established within forty-five days of any such determination. In its notification, such party shall:\n\n(a) Explain and specify the changes it contends are appropriate to the ratemaking principles and treatment and the reasons for the proposed changes;\n\n(b) Provide a description of the alternatives that it evaluated and the process that it went through in developing its proposed changes; and\n\n(c) Provide detailed workpapers that support the evaluation and the process whereby proposed changes were developed.\n\n(4) If a party, including the electrical corporation, has concerns regarding the proposed changes, that party shall file a notice of its concerns within thirty days of the other party's filing. If the parties do not reach agreement on changes to the ratemaking principles and treatment within ninety days of the date the notice was filed, whether the previously approved ratemaking and treatment will be changed shall be determined by the commission.\n\n5. A determination of ratemaking principles and treatment under this section does not preclude an electrical corporation from also petitioning the commission under either or both of sections 393.1700 and 393.1705, provided that any costs to which such ratemaking principles and treatment would have applied in the electrical corporation's general rate proceedings which become funded by securitized utility tariff bond proceeds from a securitized utility tariff bond issued under section 393.1700 shall not thereafter be reflected in the electrical corporation's base rates.\n\n6. If determined by the commission to be just, reasonable, and necessary for the provision of safe and adequate service, the electrical corporation shall be permitted to retain coal-fired generating assets in rate base and recover prudently incurred costs associated with operating the coal-fired assets, including at a low capacity factor, or that are offline and providing capacity only in order to remain in service to customers for reliability during events such as extreme weather.\n\n7. The commission may promulgate rules necessary to implement the provisions of sections 393.1700 to 393.1715. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2021, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2021 H.B. 734, A.L. 2022 S.B. 745)",

Resource planning — commission duties — schedule to file plans, contents — report — commission approval, procedure — rulemaking — definitions. —1. The commission shall, by August 28, 2027, and every four years or as needed thereafter, commence an integrated resource planning proceeding for electrical corporations. As part of such proceeding, the commission shall:\n\n(1) Identify any required planning reserve margins and applicable local clearing requirements, and any proposed planning reserve margins and local clearing requirements which are scheduled to take effect within a relevant future timeframe;\n\n(2) Identify significant existing state or federal environmental regulations, laws, or rules and identify how each such regulation, law, or rule may apply to electrical corporations in this state;\n\n(3) Identify separately significant proposed state or federal environmental regulations, laws, or rules and identify how each such regulation, law, or rule may apply to electrical corporations in this state;\n\n(4) Establish an alternative resource plan or plans that shall be included in an electrical corporation's integrated resource plan filing pursuant to subsection 3 of this section, and the factors that each electrical corporation may take into account in developing such plans, including, but not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(a) Projected planning reserve margins and local clearing requirements and the environmental regulations, laws, or rules pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, respectively;\n\n(b) Projections of future loads including both energy and capacity over the planning period;\n\n(c) The supply-side and demand-side resources that may reasonably address any need for additional energy and capacity, including, but not limited to, the type of generation technology for any proposed generation facility, projected load impact due to electrification or economic development projects, and projected load management and demand response savings;\n\n(d) The projected cost of different types of technologies and fuel used for electric generation; and\n\n(e) Any other factors the commission may order to be considered;\n\n(5) Identify or designate any software, data standards, and formatting to be used in modeling the alternative resource plan or plans pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection;\n\n(6) Complete such proceeding no less than eighteen months prior to the first integrated resource plan filing pursuant to subsection 2 of this section.\n\n2. Not later than August 28, 2027, the commission shall publish a schedule for electrical corporations to file an integrated resource plan every four years, with the first integrated resource plan or plans filing to occur not before the first day of the nineteenth month after publication of such schedule. Each electrical corporation shall, pursuant to the published schedule, file with the commission an integrated resource plan that includes an alternative resource plan or plans meeting the requirements of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section, and such other alternative resource plans as the electrical corporation deems appropriate. All alternative resource plans shall cover a minimum sixteen-year planning horizon. All such plans shall reflect projections of an electrical corporation's load obligations and how under each such plan the electrical corporation would reliably meet its projected load obligations over such periods consistent with applicable planning reserve margins, local clearing requirements, and applicable state and federal environmental regulations, laws, or rules.\n\n3. Without limiting the requirements set forth in subsection 2 of this section, an electrical corporation's integrated resource plan filing shall include:\n\n(1) Information regarding generating units in the electrical corporation's existing portfolio, including, but not limited to, unit characteristics, current and expected accredited capacity by season, licensing status, current depreciation rates for each generating unit, currently expected retirement dates and, if applicable, any remaining useful life of each generating unit, and identification of potential capital projects that are reasonably expected to result in the extension of the retirement date of each generating unit;\n\n(2) Plans for meeting current and future generation attribute needs, with estimates of the capital and operating and maintenance costs over the planning horizon for all proposed construction and major investments in new generating units, including costs associated with transmission or distribution infrastructure that would be required to integrate such investments into the electrical corporation's system;\n\n(3) Identification of the generation attribute necessary for the provision of safe and adequate service at just and reasonable rates;\n\n(4) Analysis of the cost, performance, expected accredited capacity by season, and viability of all reasonable options available to meet projected generation attribute needs, including, but not limited to, existing electric generation facilities, and an explanation why an electrical corporation selected the options outlined in the plan;\n\n(5) Analysis of alternative resource plans to test risk factors identified by the electrical corporation;\n\n(6) An explanation of how the electrical corporation uses capacity expansion optimization software for the development of alternative resource plans;\n\n(7) Projections of rate impacts including rate impacts from fuel costs of the top four alternative resource plans including the preferred plan for the periods covered by the plan;\n\n(8) Forecasts of the electrical corporation's sales by hour under reasonable scenarios;\n\n(9) The types of generation technologies proposed for generation facilities contained in the plans and the proposed accredited capacity of the generation facilities as estimated by the corporation and the relevant regional transmission organization or independent system operator, including projected fuel costs under reasonable scenarios;\n\n(10) An analysis of potential new or upgraded electric transmission and distribution options for the electrical corporation;\n\n(11) Analysis of the projected firm gas transportation contracts or natural gas storage the electrical corporation will hold to provide an adequate supply of fuel to new generation facilities;\n\n(12) Projected load management, demand response impact, and peak demand reduction for the electrical corporation, including, but not limited to, the magnitude of expected load impacts during the anticipated hours, seasons, and years and the projected costs for such plans;\n\n(13) An explanation of how the electrical corporation will comply with all applicable state and federal environmental regulations, laws, and rules, and the projected costs of complying with those regulations, laws, and rules;\n\n(14) Expected resource planning and system impacts of contemplated programs and mechanisms associated with new load, reduced load, or retained load associated with economic development rates or riders and programs offered in accordance with section 393.1075, as well as other programs offered under current law;\n\n(15) Results from a request for information or proposals to provide any new supply-side resources needed to serve the corporation's projected electric load, applicable planning reserve margin, and local clearing requirement during the initial four-year planning period. The request for information or proposals may define qualifying performance standards, contract terms, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, past performance, and other criteria that responses or respondents to the request for information shall meet in order to be considered by the corporation in its integrated resource plan. Respondents to a request for information or proposals may request that certain proprietary information be treated as confidential or highly confidential pursuant to the commission's governing rules. A corporation that issues a request for information or proposals under this subsection shall use the resulting information or proposals to inform its integrated resource plan and include all of the submitted information or proposals as attachments to its integrated resource plan filing;\n\n(16) Selection of a preferred resource plan;\n\n(17) Delineation of an implementation plan covering a four-year implementation period ending three hundred sixty-five days after the electrical corporation's next-scheduled quadrennial integrated resource plan filing, which shall specify the construction or acquisition by the utility of specific supply-side resources or a specified quantity of supply-side resources by supply-side resource type, or both, for which construction or acquisition is planned to commence within said four-year implementation period; and\n\n(18) Any other information that the commission may specify by rule.\n\n4. The commission shall, after a hearing is conducted, issue a report and order no later than three hundred sixty days after the electrical corporation files an integrated resource plan under this section, unless the commission grants itself an extension for good cause for the issuance of the report and order. Up to one hundred fifty days after an electrical corporation makes its initial integrated resource plan filing, the electrical corporation may file an update of the cost estimates provided under subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section if the cost estimates have materially changed. An electrical corporation shall not modify any other aspect of the initial integrated resource plan filing unless the commission grants the electrical corporation the ability to do so. The commission's report and order shall determine whether the electrical corporation has submitted sufficient documentation and selected a preferred resource plan that represents a reasonable and prudent means of meeting the electrical corporation's load serving obligations at just and reasonable rates. In making the determination, the commission shall consider whether the plan appropriately balances all of the following factors:\n\n(1) Resource adequacy to serve anticipated peak electric load and seasonal peak demand forecasts, applicable planning reserve margin, local clearing requirements, and the role of energy and capacity markets;\n\n(2) Reliability;\n\n(3) Rate impacts;\n\n(4) The availability for purchase from third parties of affordable and reliable generation, together with any required transmission;\n\n(5) Overall cost-effectiveness in providing service;\n\n(6) Commodity price risks;\n\n(7) Diversity of supply-side resources;\n\n(8) Competitive pricing;\n\n(9) Participation in regional transmission organization markets; and\n\n(10) Compliance with applicable state and federal environmental regulations.\n\n5. (1) If the commission determines that the preferred resource plan is a reasonable and prudent means of meeting the electrical corporation's load serving obligations, such determination shall constitute the commission's permission for the electrical corporation to construct or acquire the specified supply-side resources, or a specified quantity of supply-side resources by supply-side resource type, or both, identified by the commission, that were reflected in the implementation plan submitted under subdivision (17) of subsection 3 of this section, provided that construction commences or the acquisition agreement is executed within the four-year implementation period. With respect to such resources, when the electrical corporation files an application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to authorize construction or acquisition of such resource or resources pursuant to subsection 1 of section 393.170, the commission shall be deemed to have determined that the supply-side resources for which such a determination was made are necessary or convenient for the public interest. In such a certificate of convenience and necessity proceeding, the commission's inquiry shall be limited to considering the electrical corporation's qualifications to construct and operate the resources, the electrical corporation's ability to finance the construction or acquisition of the resources, and siting considerations. The commission shall take all reasonable steps to expedite such a certificate of convenience and necessity proceeding and shall issue its decision in such a proceeding within one hundred twenty days of the date that the electrical corporation files its application. Prior to the expiration of the one hundred*twenty-day period, the commission, upon a showing of good cause, can extend the one hundred twenty-day period for up to an additional sixty days. An electrical corporation shall annually, or more frequently if required by the commission, report to the commission the status of supply-side resources being implemented during the implementation period.\n\n(2) If the commission determines that the preferred resource plan, in whole or in part, is not a reasonable and prudent means of meeting the electrical corporation's load serving obligations, the commission shall have the authority to specify in its report and order the deficiencies in the preferred resource plan and may require the electrical corporation to make a further filing within sixty days after issuance of the report and order addressing the deficiencies and the electrical corporation may propose modifications to its original preferred resource plan. If such an order requiring a further filing by the electrical corporation is issued, the commission's report and order issued under this subsection shall not be final for purposes of rehearing pursuant to section 386.500 or an appeal pursuant to section 386.510. Other parties to the integrated resource plan docket shall have sixty days to respond to the electrical corporation's further filing, unless the commission grants an extension for good cause to respond to the electrical corporation's further filing. Within sixty days after the deadline for such other parties' filings, the commission shall issue a report and order, which shall be final for purposes of rehearing pursuant to section 386.500, and appeal pursuant to section 386.510, indicating whether the deficiencies have been cured by the electrical corporation's further filing and the commission may approve the electrical corporation's modified preferred resource plan and may approve specific supply-side resources, or a specified quantity of supply-side resources by supply-side resource type, or both. If the commission finds continued deficiencies in the electrical corporation's modified preferred resource plan:\n\n(a) The commission may initiate a complaint proceeding pursuant to the provisions of section 393.270;\n\n(b) The electrical corporation shall not be eligible for a limited inquiry in any proceeding under section 393.170 as set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection for any resource additions not approved by the commission; and\n\n(c) The electrical corporation shall not be eligible for construction work in progress as set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection for any resource additions not approved by the commission.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding section 393.135 to the contrary, if approved in a proceeding granting permission and approval under subsection 1 of section 393.170, an electrical corporation may be permitted to include in the corporation's rate base any amounts recorded to construction work in progress for the investments for which permission is given under subdivision (1) of this subsection. The inclusion of construction work in progress shall be in lieu of any otherwise applicable allowance for funds used during construction that would have accrued from and after the effective date of new base rates that reflect inclusion of the construction work in progress in rate base. The commission shall determine, in a proceeding under section 393.170, the amount of construction work in progress that may be included in rate base. The amount shall be limited by:\n\n(a) The estimated cost of such project, identified in subdivision (1) of this subsection; and\n\n(b) Project expenditures made within the estimated construction period for such project.\n\n­­Base rate recoveries arising from inclusion of construction work in progress in base rates are subject to refund, together with interest on the refunded amount at the same rate as the rate of interest for delinquent taxes determined by the director of revenue in accordance with section 32.065, if and to the extent the commission determines, in a subsequent complaint or general rate proceeding, that construction costs giving rise to the construction work in progress included in rate base were imprudently incurred or if the project for which construction costs have been included in the rate base is not placed in service within a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the commission. Rate base used to determine return deferred under subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of section 393.1400 shall include an offset for rate base that has been used to determine return included in base rates as a result of construction work in progress inclusion in rate base under this subsection. The offset shall apply from and after the in-service date of the asset that has been used to determine return included in base rates as result of construction work in progress inclusion in rate base under subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of section 393.135.\n\n(4) Commission determination of the reasonableness and prudence of a preferred resource plan as set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection does not preclude the commission from making ratemaking adjustments arising from the electrical corporation's unreasonableness and imprudence in executing the construction or acquisition of the specific supply-side resource, or the specified quantity of supply-side resources, or both, identified by the commission under subdivision (1) of this subsection, during a subsequent general rate or complaint proceeding.\n\n6. The commission shall promulgate rules necessary to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n7. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Electrical corporation\", the same as defined in section 386.020, but shall not include an electrical corporation as described in subsection 2 of section 393.110;\n\n(2)\"Firm gas transportation\", an anticipated agreement entered into between the electrical corporation and a natural gas transmission provider for a set period of time to provide firm delivery of natural gas to an electric generation facility;\n\n(3)\"Generation attribute\", the capacity, energy, and other generating unit capabilities used in regional energy and capacity markets to differentiate services that can be provided by various types of generating units.\n\n(L. 2025 S.B. 4)\n\n*Word \"and\" appears here in original rolls.",
