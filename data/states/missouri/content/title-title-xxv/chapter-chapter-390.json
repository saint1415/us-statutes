A person deemed qualified pursuant to this subsection is not required to file an application pursuant to section 390.290 to continue providing intrastate transportation as a registered property carrier, but rather, upon such person's compliance with the licensing and insurance requirements of the division the person is deemed to have a property carrier registration in force as required pursuant to section 390.270, authorizing the person to transport property except household goods in intrastate commerce on the public highways, unless the person's property carrier registration is suspended, revoked or transferred to another person as provided by law.
