Compact — entered into. —The Nonresident Violator Compact, hereinafter called \"the compact,\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\n(a) The party jurisdictions find that:\n\n(1) In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction:\n\n(i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date; or\n\n(ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or\n\n(iii) Is taken directly to court for his trial to be held.\n\n(2) In some instances, the motorist's driver's license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation.\n\n(3) The purpose of the practices described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.\n\n(4) A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(5) The practice described in paragraph (1) above causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.\n\n(6) The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, as described in paragraph (2) above, is viewed with disfavor.\n\n(7) The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\n(b) It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:\n\n(1) Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.\n\n(2) Allow motorists to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and proceed on their way without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued.\n\n(3) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.\n\n(4) Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.\n\n(c) The purpose of this compact is to:\n\n(1) Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in paragraph (b) above in a uniform and orderly manner.\n\n(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction.\n\n(a) In the Nonresident Violator Compact, the following words have the meaning indicated, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n(b) (1)\"Citation\"means any summons, ticket, or other official document issued by a police officer for a traffic violation containing an order which requires the motorist to respond.\n\n(2)\"Collateral\"means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, following the issuance by a police officer of a citation for a traffic violation.\n\n(3)\"Court\"means a court of law or traffic tribunal.\n\n(4)\"Driver's license\"means any license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of the home jurisdiction.\n\n(5)\"Home jurisdiction\"means the jurisdiction that issued the driver's license of the traffic violator.\n\n(6)\"Issuing jurisdiction\"means the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist.\n\n(7)\"Jurisdiction\"means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(8)\"Motorist\"means a driver of a motor vehicle operating in a party jurisdiction other than the home jurisdiction.\n\n(9)\"Personal recognizance\"means an agreement by a motorist made at the time of issuance of the traffic citation that he will comply with the terms of that traffic citation.\n\n(10)\"Police officer\"means any individual authorized by the party jurisdiction to issue a citation for a traffic violation.\n\n(11)\"Terms of the citation\"means those options expressly stated upon the citation.\n\nArticle III\n\n(a) When issuing a citation for a traffic violation, a police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a driver's license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in paragraph (b) of this article, require the motorist to post collateral to secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist's signed, personal recognizance that he or she will comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(b) Personal recognizance is acceptable only if not prohibited by law. If mandatory appearance is required, it must take place immediately following issuance of the citation.\n\n(c) Upon failure of a motorist to comply with the terms of a traffic citation, the appropriate official shall report the failure to comply to the licensing authority of the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued. The report shall be made in accordance with procedures specified by the issuing jurisdiction and shall contain information as specified in the Compact Manual as minimum requirements for effective processing by the home jurisdiction.\n\n(d) Upon receipt of the report, the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home jurisdiction of the motorist the information in a form and content as contained in the Compact Manual.\n\n(e) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction may not suspend the privilege of a motorist for whom a report has been transmitted.\n\n(f) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of transmission is more than six months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued unless the motorist was operating a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) or was a Commercial Driver License (CDL) holder at the time of the offense.\n\n(g) The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation where the date of issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of entry for the two jurisdictions affected.\n\n(a) Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply from the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction, the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a suspension action, in accordance with the home jurisdiction's procedures, to suspend the motorist's driver's license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the home jurisdiction licensing authority. Due process safeguards will be accorded.\n\n(b) The licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing jurisdictions as provided in the Compact Manual.\n\nExcept as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party jurisdiction to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, or to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party jurisdiction and a nonparty jurisdiction.\n\n(a) For the purpose of administering the provisions of this compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, a Board of Compact Administrators is established. The board shall be composed of one representative from each party jurisdiction to be known as the compact administrator. The compact administrator shall be appointed by the jurisdiction executive and will serve and be subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction he represents. A compact administrator may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate may not be entitled to serve unless written notification of his identity has been given to the board.\n\n(b) Each member of the Board of Compact Administrators shall be entitled to one vote. No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor. Action by the board shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the party jurisdictions are represented.\n\n(c) The board shall elect annually, from its membership, a chairman and a vice chairman.\n\n(d) The board shall adopt bylaws, not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact or the laws of a party jurisdiction, for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind its bylaws.\n\n(e) The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any jurisdiction, the United States, or any other governmental agency, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of the same.\n\n(f) The board may contract with, or accept services or personnel from, any governmental or intergovernmental agency, person, firm, or corporation, or any private nonprofit organization or institution.\n\n(g) The board shall formulate all necessary procedures and develop uniform forms and documents for administering the provisions of this compact.\n\n­­All procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action shall be contained in the Compact Manual.\n\nArticle VII\n\n(a) This compact shall become effective when it has been adopted by at least two jurisdictions.\n\n(b) (1) Entry into the compact shall be made by a Resolution of Ratification executed by the authorized officials of the applying jurisdiction and submitted to the chairman of the board.\n\n(2) The resolution shall be in a form and content as provided in the Compact Manual and shall include statements that in substance are as follows:\n\n(i) A citation of the authority by which the jurisdiction is empowered to become a party to this compact.\n\n(ii) Agreement to comply with the terms and provisions of the compact.\n\n(iii) That compact entry is with all jurisdictions then party to the compact and with any jurisdiction that legally becomes a party to the compact.\n\n(3) The effective date of entry shall be specified by the applying jurisdiction, but it shall not be less than 60 days after notice has been given by the chairman of the Board of Compact Administrators or by the secretariat of the board to each party jurisdiction that the resolution from the applying jurisdiction has been received.\n\n(c) A party jurisdiction may withdraw from this compact by official written notice to the other party jurisdictions, but a withdrawal shall not take effect until 90 days after notice of withdrawal is given. The notice shall be directed to the compact administrator of each member jurisdiction.

Amendments shall be presented in resolution form to the chairman of the Board of Compact Administrators and may be initiated by one or more party jurisdictions.\n\n(b) Adoption of an amendment shall require endorsement of all party jurisdictions and shall become effective 30 days after the date of the last endorsement.\n\n(c) Failure of a party jurisdiction to respond to the compact chairman within 120 days after receipt of the proposed amendment shall constitute endorsement.\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes stated herein. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party jurisdiction or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance, the compact shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any jurisdiction party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining jurisdictions and in full force and effect as to the jurisdiction affected as to all severable matters.\n\nThis compact shall be known as the Nonresident Violator Compact.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 980 § 1, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1402)\n\n(1991) Missouri nonresident violator compact does not infringe upon the rights of the national government in violation of art. 1, sec. 10, U.S.C.A.

Any person charged with a bailable offense, at his or her appearance before an associate circuit judge or judge may be ordered released pending trial, appeal, or other stage of the proceedings against him on his personal recognizance, unless the associate circuit judge or judge determines, in the exercise of his discretion, that such a release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required. When such a determination is made, the associate circuit judge or judge may either in lieu of or in addition to the above methods of release, impose any or any combination of the following conditions of release which will reasonably assure the appearance of the person for trial:\n\n(1) Place the person in the custody of a designated person or organization agreeing to supervise him;\n\n(2) Place restriction on the travel, association, or place of abode of the person during the period of release;\n\n(3) Require the execution of a bail bond with sufficient solvent sureties, or the deposit of cash in lieu thereof;\n\n(4) Require the person to report regularly to some officer of the court, or peace officer, in such manner as the associate circuit judge or judge directs;\n\n(5) Require the execution of a bond in a given sum and the deposit in the registry of the court of ten percent, or such lesser percent as the judge directs, of the sum in cash or negotiable bonds of the United States or of the state of Missouri or any political subdivision thereof;\n\n(6) Place the person on house arrest with electronic monitoring; except that all costs associated with the electronic monitoring shall be charged to the person on house arrest. If the judge finds the person unable to afford the costs associated with electronic monitoring, the judge may order that the person be placed on house arrest with electronic monitoring if the county commission agrees to pay from the general revenue of the county the costs of such monitoring. If the person on house arrest is unable to afford the costs associated with electronic monitoring and the county commission does not agree to pay the costs of such electronic monitoring, the judge shall not order that the person be placed on house arrest with electronic monitoring;\n\n(7) Impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to assure appearance as required, including a condition requiring that the person return to custody after specified hours.\n\n2. In determining which conditions of release will reasonably assure appearance, the associate circuit judge or judge shall, on the basis of available information, take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence against the accused, the accused's family ties, employment, financial resources, character and mental condition, the length of his residence in the community, his record of convictions, and his record of appearance at court proceedings or flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings.\n\n3. An associate circuit judge or judge authorizing the release of a person under this section shall issue an appropriate order containing a statement of the conditions imposed, if any, shall inform such person of the penalties applicable to violations of the conditions of his release and shall advise him that a warrant for his arrest will be issued immediately upon any such violation.\n\n4. A person for whom conditions of release are imposed and who after twenty-four hours from the time of the release hearing continues to be detained as a result of his inability to meet the conditions of release, shall, upon application, be entitled to have the condition reviewed by the associate circuit judge or judge who imposed them. The motion shall be determined promptly.\n\n5. An associate circuit judge or judge ordering the release of a person on any condition specified in this section may at any time amend his order to impose additional or different conditions of release; except that, if the imposition of such additional or different conditions results in the detention of the person as a result of his inability to meet such conditions or in the release of the person on a condition requiring him to return to custody after specified hours, the provisions of subsection 4 of this section shall apply.\n\n6.

State v. Salisbury, 364 Mo. 1039, 271 S.W.2d 522.\n\n(1961) Where defendant failed to appear on misdemeanor charge at time fixed in his bond, the bond could be forfeited, notwithstanding his attorney appeared and the information in the case was dismissed as being insufficient.

State owes no duty to have party returned under agreement on detainers in order to avoid forfeiture of bond. State v. Patterson (A.), 508 S.W.2d 304.\n\n(1974) Held that release of surety on bond is mandatory where defendant is produced in open court after forfeiture of bond but before a judgment on the forfeiture. Proper venue for action on the bond is in court of county where action commenced, not in county to which action was transferred on change of venue. State v. Street (A.), 510 S.W.2d 225.\n\n(1974) Held that court is not required to have either accused or his bondsman called prior to forfeiture of bail. State v.
