The indictment, information or affidavit made before the associate circuit judge must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of that state; and the copy of indictment, information, affidavit, judgment of conviction or sentence must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand.\n\n(L. 1953 p. 425 § 3)\n\n(1953) Where requisition was accompanied by affidavit as required by 18 U.S.C.A. § 3182, it was sufficient even though not accompanied by indictment or information.

Hagel v. Hendrix (A.), 302 S.W.2d 323.\n\n(1994) Governor's role in evaluating extradition requests and issuing arrest warrants is judicial in nature and duties of extradition officer for governor are quasi-judicial in nature, therefore, both governor and extradition officer are entitled to absolute immunity from suit.
