Selection of grand jurors, summons and jury qualification form — notification of persons not qualified to serve — alternate grand jurors — length of service — compensation. —1. Upon order of the presiding judge of the circuit court, or a judge designated by the presiding judge, names of prospective grand jurors shall be randomly selected from the master jury list in the manner determined by the board of jury commissioners. A summons for grand jury service and a juror qualification form shall be mailed or personally served to those persons selected in the form and as required by section 494.415 for petit jurors.\n\n2. If it is determined from an examination of the juror qualification form that a person is not qualified to serve as a grand juror, that person shall be notified in a manner directed by the board of jury commissioners, and shall not be required to comply with the summons for grand jury service. The names of disqualified persons shall be deleted from the grand jury list.\n\n3. Those prospective grand jurors not disqualified from grand jury service shall constitute the grand jury list. If later determined to be ineligible or disqualified, their names shall be deleted from the master jury list.\n\n4. Those persons summoned for grand jury service shall be placed under the control and supervision of the presiding judge of the circuit court, or a judge designated by the presiding judge, who shall select twelve persons to serve as grand jurors. Alternate grand jurors as determined by the judge shall also be selected, to serve as a grand juror upon the death, disqualification, or inability of one of the persons selected as a regular grand juror. The names of those persons selected as grand jurors and alternate grand jurors shall be deleted from the grand jury list.\n\n5. The presiding judge of the circuit court, or a judge designated by the presiding judge, shall have the authority to convene, recess, and adjourn a grand jury as, in his discretion, he deems necessary, and at times and places as he specifies. No grand jury shall be required to serve for longer than a six-month period, except such term may be extended for a period not to exceed sixty days, solely for the purpose of considering and completing matters already before the grand jury. No new matters shall be presented to the grand jury during its extended service. Nothing contained in this section prevents the convening of another grand jury during such extended service.\n\n6. Compensation shall be allowed grand jurors in the same amount as is provided by law for petit jurors pursuant to section 494.455.\n\n(L. 1989 S.B. 127, et al., A.L. 2003 H.B. 613)",
