System created, what districts included — trustees, appointment, terms, qualifications, election, duties — venue — audit, when — interest. —1. For the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits for public school teachers, there is hereby created and established a retirement system which shall be a body corporate, shall be under the management of a board of trustees herein described, and shall be known as \"The Public School Retirement System of Missouri\". Such system shall, by and in such name, sue and be sued, transact all of its business, invest all of its funds, and hold all of its cash, securities, and other property. The system so created shall include all school districts in this state, except those in cities that had populations of four hundred thousand or more according to the latest United States decennial census, and such others as are or hereafter may be included in a similar system or in similar systems established by law and made operative; provided, that teachers in school districts of more than four hundred thousand inhabitants who are or may become members of a local retirement system may become members of this system with the same legal benefits as accrue to present members of such state system on the terms and under the conditions provided for in section 169.021. The system hereby established shall begin operations on the first day of July next following the date upon which sections 169.010 to 169.130 shall take effect.\n\n2. The general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system and for making effective the provisions of sections 169.010 to 169.141 are hereby vested in a board of trustees of seven persons as follows: four persons to be elected as trustees by the members and retired members of the public school retirement system created by sections 169.010 to 169.141 and the public education employee retirement system created by sections 169.600 to 169.715; and three members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. The first member appointed by the governor shall replace the commissioner of education for a term beginning August 28, 1998. The other two members shall be appointed by the governor at the time each member's, who was appointed by the state board of education, term expires.\n\n3. Trustees appointed and elected shall be chosen for terms of four years from the first day of July next following their appointment or election, except that one of the elected trustees shall be a member of the public education employee retirement system and shall be initially elected for a term of three years from July 1, 1991. The initial term of one other elected trustee shall commence on July 1, 1992.\n\n4. Trustees appointed by the governor shall be residents of school districts included in the retirement system, but not employees of such districts or a state employee or a state elected official. At least one trustee so appointed shall be a retired member of the public school retirement system or the public education employee retirement system. Three elected trustees shall be members of the public school retirement system and one elected trustee shall be a member of the public education employee retirement system.\n\n5. The elections of the trustees shall be arranged for, managed and conducted by the board of trustees of the retirement system.\n\n6. If a vacancy occurs in the office of trustee, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled.\n\n7. Trustees of the retirement system shall serve without compensation but they shall be reimbursed for expenses necessarily incurred through service on the board of trustees.\n\n8. Each trustee shall be commissioned by the governor, and before entering upon the duties of the trustee's office, shall take and subscribe to an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution of the United States, and of the state of Missouri and to demean himself or herself faithfully in the trustee's office. Such oath as subscribed to shall be filed in the office of secretary of state of this state.\n\n9. Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote in the board of trustees. Four votes shall be necessary for a decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board of trustees. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, a meeting need not be called or held to make any decision on a matter before the board. Each member must be sent by the executive director a copy of the matter to be decided with full information from the files of the board of trustees. The unanimous decision of four trustees may decide the issue by signing a document declaring their decision and sending such written instrument to the executive director of the board, provided that no other member of the board of trustees shall send a dissenting decision to the executive director of the board within fifteen days after such document and information was mailed to the trustee. If any member is not in agreement with four members the matter is to be passed on at a regular board meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose.\n\n10. The board of trustees shall elect one of their number as chairman, and shall employ a full-time executive director, not one of their number, who shall be the executive officer of the board. Other employees of the board shall be chosen only upon the recommendation of the executive director.\n\n11. The board of trustees shall employ an actuary who shall be its technical advisor on matters regarding the operation of the retirement system, and shall perform such duties as are essential in connection therewith, including the recommendation for adoption by the board of mortality and other necessary tables, and the recommendation of the level rate of contributions required for operation of the system.\n\n12.

At least once in the three-year period following the establishment of the retirement system, and in each five-year period thereafter, the board of trustees shall cause to be made an actuarial investigation into the mortality, service, and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries of the system, and shall make any changes in the mortality, service, and other tables then in use which the results of the investigation show to be necessary.\n\n14. Subject to the limitations of sections 169.010 to 169.141 and 169.600 to 169.715, the board of trustees shall formulate and adopt rules and regulations for the government of its own proceedings and for the administration of the retirement system.\n\n15.

The executive director shall notify by certified mail both employer and member, retired member, beneficiary or survivor interested in such determination. Any member, retired member, beneficiary or survivor, district or employer adversely affected by such determination, at any time within thirty days after being notified of such determination, may appeal to the circuit court of Cole County. Such appeal shall be tried and determined anew in the circuit court and such court shall hear and consider any and all competent testimony relative to the issues in the case, which may be offered by either party thereto. The circuit court shall determine the rights of the parties under sections 169.010 to 169.141 and 169.600 to 169.715 using the same standard provided in section 536.150, and the judgment or order of such circuit court shall be binding upon the parties and the board shall carry out such judgment or order unless an appeal is taken from such decision of the circuit court. Appeals may be had from the circuit court by the employer, member, retired member, beneficiary, survivor or the board, in the manner provided by the civil code.\n\n16. The board of trustees shall keep a record of all its proceedings, which shall be open to public inspection. It shall prepare annually a comprehensive annual financial report, the financial section of which shall be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and shall include the independent auditor's opinion letter. The report shall also include information on the actuarial status and the investments of the system. The reports shall be preserved by the executive director and made available for public inspection.\n\n17. The board of trustees shall provide for the maintenance of an individual account with each member, setting forth such data as may be necessary for a ready determination of the member's earnings, contributions, and interest accumulations. It shall also collect and keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for the preparation of the required mortality and service tables and for the compilation of such other information as shall be required for the valuation of the system's assets and liabilities. Except for information pertaining to the salaries and benefits of the executive director and other employees of the board described under subsection 10 of this section, all individually identifiable information pertaining to members, retirees, beneficiaries and survivors shall be confidential.\n\n18. The board of trustees shall meet regularly at least twice each year, with the dates of such meetings to be designated in the rules and regulations adopted by the board. Such other meetings as are deemed necessary may be called by the chairman of the board or by any four members acting jointly.\n\n19. The headquarters of the retirement system shall be in Jefferson City, where suitable office space, utilities and other services and equipment necessary for the operation of the system shall be provided by the board of trustees and all costs shall be paid from funds of the system. All suits or proceedings directly or indirectly against the board of trustees, the board's members or employees or the retirement system established by sections 169.010 to 169.141 or 169.600 to 169.715 shall be brought in Cole County.\n\n20. The board may appoint an attorney or firm of attorneys to be the legal advisor to the board and to represent the board in legal proceedings, however, if the board does not make such an appointment, the attorney general shall be the legal advisor of the board of trustees, and shall represent the board in all legal proceedings.\n\n21. The board of trustees shall arrange for adequate surety bonds covering the executive director. When approved by the board, such bonds shall be deposited in the office of the secretary of state of this state.\n\n22.

Whenever two-thirds of the teachers of a school district having a population of more than seventy-five thousand and which has, pursuant to law, a local retirement system, shall file a petition with the board of trustees of the local retirement system and with the local board of education of such school district requesting that their membership in the local retirement system be transferred to the public school retirement system of Missouri, said petition if and when approved by the board of trustees of the local retirement system and the board of education of the local school district shall be transmitted to the board of trustees of the state retirement system. Thereupon at such time as all the terms and conditions of this section as apply to teachers, as hereinafter set forth, are fulfilled the board of trustees of the state retirement system shall in mutual agreement with the board of trustees of the local retirement system and the local board of education set a date which shall be not later than one year after the filing of the petition with the state system, upon which the local system shall be declared discontinued as to such teachers and all persons who are or may become teachers, as hereinbefore defined, in such local district shall be members of the state retirement system.\n\n2. Prior to the date when the local system is discontinued as to teachers under the provision of this section, the board of trustees of the local retirement system shall transfer to the board of trustees of the public school retirement system of Missouri such moneys, bonds and evidences of indebtedness as represent the accumulated contributions of each teacher member of the local retirement system, but not in excess of the amount of the accumulated contributions of a teacher already a member of the state system with the same period of membership service and same annual salaries during such period, along with an equal amount representing contributions by the local board of education on account of such teachers; and these funds are to be credited by the board of trustees as have other contributions received by the public school retirement system of Missouri. If the accumulated contributions of any teacher member in the local retirement system are in excess of these requirements, such excess shall be refunded to the teacher by the local system.\n\n3. There shall be further transferred to the state retirement system by the board of trustees of such local retirement system, if available from its funds, and if not by the board of education of the local school district from school district funds, an amount of money sufficient to place those teachers who so elect, on an equality of benefits with those originally becoming members of such state system, providing that any contributions from teachers transferred from such local retirement system due the state retirement system to equalize contributions previously made by teachers already members of the state system shall be paid to the board of trustees of the state system by the local school district and charged to such teacher's salary account and withheld by the local district in equal monthly installments during the succeeding school year. A like amount shall be transferred to the board of trustees of the state system by the board of trustees of such local retirement system, if available from its funds, and if not by the board of education of the local school district from school district funds. If the full amount as required by this subsection for any member is not paid to the board of trustees of the state system, such member shall receive no credit for prior service and shall receive credit only for such membership service as the amount paid in his behalf will provide.\n\n4. All teachers who have been placed on retirement pursuant to the provisions of the law creating the local system previous to the date when the local system is discontinued as to teachers under the provisions of this section shall be entitled to receive from the state system after the discontinuance of the local system the same monthly benefits they were receiving from the local system; provided that prior to the date of discontinuance of the local system, the board of trustees of the local system shall pay to the extent of its available funds, and if such funds are insufficient, the board of education of the local district shall pay from school district funds to the board of trustees of the state system the amount necessary to maintain such monthly payments to retired teachers plus such amount as required to pay the benefits provided by the state system to all teachers of the local system who have attained age sixty-nine as of date of discontinuance but have not then retired, such amounts to be agreed to by the board of trustees of the two retirement systems and the board of education of the local school district; provided, however, that in school districts having a population of not less than two hundred thousand inhabitants, in lieu of the amount required to be paid because of the teachers of the local system who have attained age sixty-nine but have not retired an additional payment shall be made of the amount necessary to prevent an increase in the required contribution rate as provided for in section 169.030 as determined by the actuary of the public school retirement system of Missouri and as agreed to by the board of trustees of the two retirement systems and the board of education of the local school district.\n\n5. Any amount to be paid the board of trustees of the state system by the board of education of the local school district in fulfillment of the conditions of this section may be paid in a lump sum or in installments within ten years from date of discontinuance of the local system with interest payable annually on the unpaid balance at the rate of two percent; provided, however, that in school districts having a population of not less than two hundred thousand, the period within which payment in installments may be made may be increased from ten to twenty-five years; provided, further, that in districts having a population of not less than two hundred thousand inhabitants the rate to be paid on unpaid balance shall be the average rate which the investments of the state system earn during the same year.\n\n6. All employees in such school district having a population of more than seventy-five thousand and less than one hundred thousand, other than teachers and who are not on retirement, shall, upon two-thirds vote, withdraw therefrom and shall receive from the local retirement system the amount credited to their respective accounts, and equal amounts from funds contributed by the local school district; and each employee, other than a teacher, who is on retirement pursuant to provisions of the law creating the local retirement system, shall receive in lieu of all his rights and interest in such local retirement system an amount of money mutually agreed to by the local board of education and the annuitant. The effective date of dissolution of the local system under this subsection shall be fixed by the local board of education and the local retirement system.\n\n7. All employees in school districts having a population of not less than two hundred thousand inhabitants other than certificated teachers and who are not on retirement shall continue to be members of the existing local retirement system subject to the right of withdrawal therefrom at any time, regardless of whether or not he continues to be an employee, with right to be paid on demand the amount of his accumulated contributions with interest standing to the credit of his individual account in the employees' contribution fund but without any right to again become a member of the system; and each employee of such school district other than certificated teachers who is on retirement pursuant to provisions of the law under which the local retirement system exists shall continue to be entitled to receive his retirement benefits in accordance with the terms and provisions of said system, and such local retirement system shall continue in force and effect with respect to such employees who are not certificated teachers until such time as all shall have withdrawn and all obligations to such retirants shall have been discharged or released; provided that any employee other than certificated teachers becoming such an employee after the effective date of the transfer of the certificated teachers to the state retirement system shall have the option of refraining from becoming a member of the local system; provided further if in any case where a certificated teacher, now a member of the local retirement system, is transferred to the state system his actual or potential retirement benefits would be less than the amounts he would have received from the local system if he had continued therein, the local retirement system or board of education shall make up the difference.\n\n(L. 1951 p. 520, A.L. 1953 p. 467)",

The funds required for the operation of the retirement system created by sections 169.010 to 169.141 shall come from contributions made in equal amounts by members of the system and their employers, except as provided for certain members and employers by section 104.342, and from such interest as may be derived from the investment of any part of such contributions. All contributions shall be transmitted to the board of trustees by employers in such manner and at such time as the board by rule shall require.\n\n2. For each school year following the date on which the system becomes operative, each and every employer of one or more persons who are members of the system shall transmit to the board of trustees, in the manner and accompanied by such supporting data as the board shall prescribe, twice the amount that is deductible from the pay of such employee or employees during the school year. Failure or refusal to transmit such amount as required shall render the person or persons responsible therefor individually liable for twice the amount so withheld. Suits for the recovery of amounts for which individuals are thus rendered liable shall be instituted and prosecuted by the board of trustees in the name of the retirement system. In addition to such civil penalty, and not in lieu thereof, any person or persons made responsible for the payment of contributions who shall willfully and knowingly fail or refuse to transmit such contributions or any part thereof to the board of trustees shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars and not more than two hundred dollars, and each day such person or persons shall so fail or refuse to transmit such contributions shall be deemed a separate offense.\n\n3. The contributions of members of the retirement system shall be collected by their employers through appropriate deductions from paychecks, except as provided for certain members and employers by section 104.342. The total amount deducted from the paychecks of members during any school year shall equal such a percent of their salary rates as may be required by the contribution rate then in effect. Contributions transmitted to the retirement system before February 20, 1996, based on salary rates which either included or excluded employer-paid medical benefits for members, shall be deemed to have been in compliance with this section. The retirement system shall not refund or adjust contributions or adjust benefit determinations with respect to any period before February 20, 1996, solely because of the treatment of employer-paid medical benefits for members. Effective December 31, 1995, compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of Title 26 of the United States Code shall be disregarded for purposes of determining contributions under this section and calculating benefits paid by the public school retirement system of Missouri. The limitation on compensation for eligible employees shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account under the system as in effect on July 1, 1993. For this purpose, an\"eligible employee\"is an individual who was a member of the system before July 1, 1996.\n\n4. The board of trustees shall fix and certify to the employers the level rate of contribution subject to the following:\n\n(1) The level rate of contribution for a fiscal year shall not exceed the level rate of contribution for the prior fiscal year by more than one-half percent;\n\n(2) The board shall fix and certify to the employers the rate of contribution for a fiscal year no later than six months prior to the date such rate is to be effective;\n\n(3) The board shall fix and certify to the employers the rate of contribution for a fiscal year based on an actuarial valuation of the system as of a date not earlier than the last day of the second prior fiscal year. Such actuarial valuation of the system shall be performed using processes and actuarial assumptions that are in accordance with actuarial standards of practice in effect at the time the valuation is performed, as promulgated by the actuarial standards board or its successor; provided that such actuarial valuation shall be based on the entry age normal actuarial cost method and an asset valuation method based on the market value of system assets that may provide for smoothing of investment gains and losses, and, further, that the level rate of contribution shall be the total of the normal cost rate and a rate which shall amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability over a period that shall not exceed thirty years from the date of the valuation, subject to the limitations of this subsection; and\n\n(4) Not less than once every ten years the board shall have an actuary, other than the actuary performing the actuarial valuation pursuant to this section, review such actuarial valuation and perform an additional valuation of the system.\n\n5.

All funds arising from the operation of sections 169.010 to 169.141 shall belong to the retirement system herein created and shall be controlled by the board of trustees of that system which board shall provide for the collection of such funds, shall see that they are safely preserved, and shall permit their disbursement only for the purposes herein authorized. Such funds and all other funds received by the retirement system are declared and shall be deemed to be the moneys and funds of the retirement system and not revenue collected or moneys received by the state and shall not be commingled with state funds.\n\n2. The board shall invest all funds under its control which are in excess of a safe operating balance. The funds shall be invested only in those investments which a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, as provided in section 105.688. The board of trustees may delegate to duly appointed investment counselors authority to act in place of the board in the investment and reinvestment of all or part of the moneys of the system, and may also delegate to such counselors the authority to act in place of the board in the holding, purchasing, selling, assigning, transferring or disposing of any or all of the securities and investments in which such moneys shall have been invested, as well as the proceeds of such investments and such moneys. Such investment counselors shall be registered as investment advisors with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 105.662, the board may set up and maintain a public school and education employee retirement systems of Missouri investment fund account in which investment and reinvestment of all or part of the moneys of the system may be placed and be available for investment purposes. For the purpose of investing the funds of the retirement system, the funds may be combined with the funds of the public education employee retirement system of Missouri, but the funds of each system shall be accounted for separately and for all other reporting purposes shall be separate. The board of trustees may promulgate such rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this section and section 169.630 as deemed necessary for its proper administration, pursuant to the provisions of this section and this chapter. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2009, shall be invalid and void.\n\n4. No investment transaction authorized by the board shall be handled by any company or firm in which a member of the board has an interest, nor shall any member of the board profit directly or indirectly from any such investment.

Such securities or other properties which are not available in registered form may be held in bearer form or in book entry form. The retirement system is further authorized to deposit, or have deposited for its account, eligible securities in a central depository system or clearing corporation or in a federal reserve bank under a book entry system as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, sections 400.8-102 and 400.8-109. When such eligible securities of the retirement system are so deposited with a central depository system they may be merged and held in the name of the nominee of such securities depository and title to such securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of such securities depository or federal reserve bank without physical delivery of the certificates or documents representing such securities.\n\n5.

All retirement allowances or other periodic payments paid by the board shall be paid to recipients of such payments by electronic funds transfer, unless another method has been determined by the board to be appropriate. Each recipient of retirement allowances or other periodic payments shall designate a financial institution or other authorized payment agent and provide the board information necessary for the recipient to receive electronic funds transfer payments through the institution or agent designated.

Members who have accrued at least one year of membership service credit for employment in a position covered by this retirement system and who have covered employment with this retirement system following the service for which credit is being purchased may purchase membership service credit under the circumstances, terms and conditions provided in this section. With respect to each such purchase authorized by this section the following provisions apply:\n\n(1) The purchase shall be effected by the member paying to the retirement system the amount the member would have contributed and the amount the employer would have contributed had such member been an employee for the number of years for which the member is electing to purchase credit, and had the member's compensation during such period been the highest annual salary rate on record with the retirement system on the date of election to purchase credit. For purposes of this section,\"annual salary rate\"means the annual salary rate for full-time service for the position of employment. The contribution rate used in determining the amount to be paid shall be the contribution rate in effect on the date of election to purchase credit. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, for all elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system on or after January 1, 2006, the member shall receive credit based on the amount paid by the member for such credit and received by the retirement system by the close of business on June thirtieth of each year. In lieu of charging the member interest on such purchase of credit, the amount to be paid by the member for any remaining credit the member has elected to purchase but has not paid for by September thirtieth of each year shall be recalculated on the following October first using the contribution rate in effect on that July first and the highest salary of record for the member as of that July first. For all elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system prior to January 1, 2006, the retirement system shall determine the cost of such purchase using the calculation method in effect for elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system on or after January 1, 2006, provided that the member shall have a one-time, irrevocable option to continue to have the cost of such purchase be determined using the calculation method in effect at the time of such election to purchase such credit. To be effective, such option must be elected by the member on a form approved by the retirement system and such form must be received by the retirement system by the close of business on June 30, 2006. The retirement system may prohibit a purchase, impose additional requirements for making a purchase, or limit the amount of credit purchased if necessary for the retirement system to comply with federal law, including but not limited to the provisions of Section 415 of Title 26 of the United States Code. The board of trustees may promulgate such rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this section deemed necessary for its proper administration, pursuant to the provisions of this section and this chapter.

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2009, shall be invalid and void;\n\n(2) Membership service credit purchased pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be membership service in Missouri for purposes of subsection 8 of section 169.070;\n\n(3) An election to purchase membership service credit pursuant to this section and payment for the purchase shall be completed prior to termination of membership with the retirement system with interest on the unpaid balance;\n\n(4) Members may purchase membership service credit in increments of one-tenth of a year, and multiple elections to purchase may be made;\n\n(5) Additional terms and conditions applicable to purchase made pursuant to this section including, but not limited to, minimum payments, payment schedules and provisions applicable when a member fails to complete payment may be set by rules of the board.\n\n2. Membership service credit shall not be allowed pursuant to this section or sections 169.570 and 169.577 which exceeds in length the member's membership service credit for employment in a position covered by this system, and in no event may the member receive membership service credit with both this system and another public retirement system for the same service.\n\n3. A member who was employed for at least twenty hours per week on a regular basis by a public school district, public community college, public college, or public university, either inside or outside of this state, may elect to purchase equivalent membership service credit.\n\n4. A member who has served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America and who was discharged or separated from the Armed Forces by other than a dishonorable discharge may elect to purchase membership service for the period of active duty service in the Armed Forces.\n\n5. Any member granted unpaid maternity or paternity leave for a period, from a position covered by the retirement system, who returned to employment in such a position, may elect to purchase membership service credit for the period of leave.\n\n6. Any member who is or was certified as a vocational-technical teacher on the basis of having a college degree or who was required to have a period of work experience of at least two years in the area of the subject being taught in order to qualify for such certification may, upon written application to the board, purchase equivalent membership service credit for such work experience which shall not exceed the two years necessary for certification if the work experience was in the area that the member taught or is teaching and was completed in two years.\n\n7. Any member who had membership service credit with the public education employee retirement system of Missouri governed by sections 169.600 to 169.715 but which membership service credit was forfeited by withdrawal or refund may elect to purchase credit for such service. The public education employee retirement system of Missouri shall transfer to this system an amount equal to the employer contributions for the forfeited service being purchased, plus interest, which shall be applied to reduce the amount the member would otherwise pay for the purchase, provided that the amount transferred shall not exceed one-half of the purchase cost.\n\n8. A member may elect to purchase membership service credit for service rendered while on leave from an employer, as defined in section 169.010, for a not-for-profit corporation or agency whose primary purpose is support of education or education research, if the member was employed by that organization to serve twenty or more hours per week on a regular basis.\n\n9. A member who was employed by a private school, private community college, private college, or private university, either inside or outside of this state, for at least twenty hours per week on a regular basis, may elect to purchase equivalent membership service credit for such service rendered.\n\n10.

On and after the first day of July next following the operative date, any member who is sixty or more years of age and whose creditable service is five years or more, or whose sum of age and creditable service equals eighty years or more, or who has attained age fifty-five and whose creditable service is twenty-five years or more, or whose creditable service is thirty years or more regardless of age, may retire upon written application to the board of trustees and receive the full retirement benefits on the member's creditable service. Any other member whose creditable service is twenty-five or more years, or who has attained age fifty-five and whose creditable service is at least five years but less than twenty-five years, may retire upon written application to the board of trustees and receive the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member would be entitled if the member was sixty years of age.\n\n2. On and after the first day of July next following the operative date, any member who is teaching in a district included in the retirement system at the time the member becomes disabled, or who has taught in such a district at some time in the twelve months immediately preceding the member becoming disabled, and whose disability is traceable to an injury or sickness which was sustained or commenced prior to the cessation of such teaching, and whose age is less than sixty and whose creditable service in districts included in the retirement system is five years or more, may be retired with disability benefits as provided in sections 169.010 to 169.141 upon written application to the board of trustees, if the member is incapacitated because of physical or mental disability as such disability is herein defined. If such disability shall cease to exist before the recipient of such benefits reaches age sixty, the member's membership status as of the date of the member's disability retirement shall be restored. If the member seeks, before becoming eligible for such retirement allowance, to withdraw the member's accumulated contributions, the total of such disability payments shall be deducted from the amount otherwise due the member.\n\n3. Disability, as a basis for retirement, shall render the individual incapable of earning a livelihood in any occupation and shall be of such a nature as to warrant the assumption that it will be permanent. Whether or not such disability exists in any case shall be adjudged in the manner provided in subsection 15 of section 169.020 by the board of trustees on the basis of reports made by two or more physicians selected by the board to examine the member. Until the member reaches age sixty, the recipient of a disability retirement allowance may be required to submit to periodic examinations by physicians selected by the board, and if any such examination shows that the recipient is no longer incapable of earning a livelihood in any occupation, the member's disability retirement shall be terminated. For the purposes of adjustments to Social Security Administration disability benefits pursuant to 20 CFR 404.408 any member receiving disability benefits pursuant to this section who is at least fifty-five years of age and whose creditable service is at least twenty-five years shall be considered to be receiving a normal retirement benefit pursuant to this section.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1353 § 6, A.L. 1953 p. 480, A.L. 1957 p. 432, A.L. 1967 p. 250, A.L. 1972 S.B. 491, A.L. 1975 S.B. 149, A.L. 1977 H.B. 477, A.L. 1979 S.B. 40, A.L. 1984 S.B. 407, A.L. 1987 H.B. 558, et al., A.L. 1991 S.B. 242, et al., A.L. 1995 S.B. 378, A.L. 1999 S.B. 308 & 314, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808)\n\nEffective 7-1-00",

Retirement allowances, how computed, election allowed, time period — options — effect of federal O.A.S.I. coverage — cost-of-living adjustment authorized — limitation of benefits — employment of special consultant, compensation, minimum benefits. —1. The retirement allowance of a member whose age at retirement is sixty years or more and whose creditable service is five years or more, or whose sum of age and creditable service equals eighty years or more, or who has attained age fifty-five and whose creditable service is twenty-five years or more or whose creditable service is thirty years or more regardless of age, may be the sum of the following items, not to exceed one hundred percent of the member's final average salary:\n\n(1) Two and five-tenths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service;\n\n(2) Six-tenths of the amount payable for a year of membership service for each year of prior service not exceeding thirty years.\n\n­­In lieu of the retirement allowance otherwise provided in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, a member may elect to receive a retirement allowance of:\n\n(3) Two and four-tenths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is twenty-nine years or more but less than thirty years, and the member has not attained age fifty-five;\n\n(4) Two and thirty-five-hundredths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is twenty-eight years or more but less than twenty-nine years, and the member has not attained age fifty-five;\n\n(5) Two and three-tenths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is twenty-seven years or more but less than twenty-eight years, and the member has not attained age fifty-five;\n\n(6) Two and twenty-five-hundredths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is twenty-six years or more but less than twenty-seven years, and the member has not attained age fifty-five;\n\n(7) Two and two-tenths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is twenty-five years or more but less than twenty-six years, and the member has not attained age fifty-five;\n\n(8) Two and fifty-five hundredths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service, if the member's creditable service is thirty-two years or more regardless of age.\n\n2. In lieu of the retirement allowance provided in subsection 1 of this section, a member whose age is sixty years or more on September 28, 1975, may elect to have the member's retirement allowance calculated as a sum of the following items:\n\n(1) Sixty cents plus one and five-tenths percent of the member's final average salary for each year of membership service;\n\n(2) Six-tenths of the amount payable for a year of membership service for each year of prior service not exceeding thirty years;\n\n(3) Three-fourths of one percent of the sum of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection for each month of attained age in excess of sixty years but not in excess of age sixty-five.\n\n3. (1) In lieu of the retirement allowance provided either in subsection 1 or 2 of this section, collectively called \"option 1\", a member whose creditable service is twenty-five years or more or who has attained the age of fifty-five with five or more years of creditable service may elect in the member's application for retirement to receive the actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance in reduced monthly payments for life during retirement with the provision that:\n\nUpon the member's death the reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as has an insurable interest in the life of the member as the member shall have nominated in the member's election of the option, and provided further that if the person so nominated dies before the retired member, the retirement allowance will be increased to the amount the retired member would be receiving had the retired member elected option 1; or\n\nUpon the death of the member three-fourths of the reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as has an insurable interest in the life of the member and as the member shall have nominated in an election of the option, and provided further that if the person so nominated dies before the retired member, the retirement allowance will be increased to the amount the retired member would be receiving had the member elected option 1; or\n\nUpon the death of the member one-half of the reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, such person as has an insurable interest in the life of the member and as the member shall have nominated in an election of the option, and provided further that if the person so nominated dies before the retired member, the retirement allowance shall be increased to the amount the retired member would be receiving had the member elected option 1; or\n\nUpon the death of the member prior to the member having received one hundred twenty monthly payments of the member's reduced allowance, the remainder of the one hundred twenty monthly payments of the reduced allowance shall be paid to such beneficiary as the member shall have nominated in the member's election of the option or in a subsequent nomination. If there is no beneficiary so nominated who survives the member for the remainder of the one hundred twenty monthly payments, the total of the remainder of such one hundred twenty monthly payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the last person, in that order of precedence, to receive a monthly allowance in a lump sum payment. If the total of the one hundred twenty payments paid to the retired individual and the beneficiary of the retired individual is less than the total of the member's accumulated contributions, the difference shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum; or\n\nUpon the death of the member prior to the member having received sixty monthly payments of the member's reduced allowance, the remainder of the sixty monthly payments of the reduced allowance shall be paid to such beneficiary as the member shall have nominated in the member's election of the option or in a subsequent nomination. If there is no beneficiary so nominated who survives the member for the remainder of the sixty monthly payments, the total of the remainder of such sixty monthly payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the last person, in that order of precedence, to receive a monthly allowance in a lump sum payment. If the total of the sixty payments paid to the retired individual and the beneficiary of the retired individual is less than the total of the member's accumulated contributions, the difference shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum.\n\n(2) The election of an option may be made only in the application for retirement and such application must be filed prior to the date on which the retirement of the member is to be effective. If either the member or the person nominated to receive the survivorship payments dies before the effective date of retirement, the option shall not be effective, provided that:\n\n(a) If the member or a person retired on disability retirement dies after acquiring twenty-five or more years of creditable service or after attaining the age of fifty-five years and acquiring five or more years of creditable service and before retirement, except retirement with disability benefits, and the person named by the member as the member's beneficiary has an insurable interest in the life of the deceased member, the designated beneficiary may elect to receive either survivorship benefits under option 2 or a payment of the accumulated contributions of the member. If survivorship benefits under option 2 are elected and the member at the time of death would have been eligible to receive an actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance, the designated beneficiary may further elect to defer the option 2 payments until the date the member would have been eligible to receive the retirement allowance provided in subsection 1 or 2 of this section;\n\n(b) If the member or a person retired on disability retirement dies before attaining age fifty-five but after acquiring five but fewer than twenty-five years of creditable service, and the person named as the member's beneficiary has an insurable interest in the life of the deceased member, the designated beneficiary may elect to receive either a payment of the member's accumulated contributions, or survivorship benefits under option 2 to begin on the date the member would first have been eligible to receive an actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance, or to begin on the date the member would first have been eligible to receive the retirement allowance provided in subsection 1 or 2 of this section.\n\n4. If the total of the retirement or disability allowance paid to an individual before the death of the individual is less than the accumulated contributions at the time of retirement, the difference shall be paid to the beneficiary of the individual, or to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the individual in that order of precedence. If an optional benefit as provided in option 2, 3 or 4 in subsection 3 of this section had been elected, and the beneficiary dies after receiving the optional benefit, and if the total retirement allowance paid to the retired individual and the beneficiary of the retired individual is less than the total of the contributions, the difference shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the beneficiary, in that order of precedence, unless the retired individual designates a different recipient with the board at or after retirement.\n\n5. If a member dies and his or her financial institution is unable to accept the final payment or payments due to the member, the final payment or payments shall be paid to the beneficiary of the member or, if there is no beneficiary, to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the member, in that order of precedence, unless otherwise stated. If the beneficiary of a deceased member dies and his or her financial institution is unable to accept the final payment or payments, the final payment or payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the member, in that order of precedence, unless otherwise stated.\n\n6. If a member dies before receiving a retirement allowance, the member's accumulated contributions at the time of the death of the member shall be paid to the beneficiary of the member or, if there is no beneficiary, to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or to the estate of the member, in that order of precedence; except that, no such payment shall be made if the beneficiary elects option 2 in subsection 3 of this section, unless the beneficiary dies before having received benefits pursuant to that subsection equal to the accumulated contributions of the member, in which case the amount of accumulated contributions in excess of the total benefits paid pursuant to that subsection shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the beneficiary, in that order of precedence.\n\n7. If a member ceases to be a public school employee as herein defined and certifies to the board of trustees that such cessation is permanent, or if the membership of the person is otherwise terminated, the member shall be paid the member's accumulated contributions with interest.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 169.010 to 169.141 to the contrary, if a member ceases to be a public school employee after acquiring five or more years of membership service in Missouri, the member may at the option of the member leave the member's contributions with the retirement system and claim a retirement allowance any time after reaching the minimum age for voluntary retirement. When the member's claim is presented to the board, the member shall be granted an allowance as provided in sections 169.010 to 169.141 on the basis of the member's age, years of service, and the provisions of the law in effect at the time the member requests the member's retirement to become effective.\n\n9. The retirement allowance of a member retired because of disability shall be nine-tenths of the allowance to which the member's creditable service would entitle the member if the member's age were sixty, or fifty percent of one-twelfth of the annual salary rate used in determining the member's contributions during the last school year for which the member received a year of creditable service immediately prior to the member's disability, whichever is greater, except that no such allowance shall exceed the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled upon retirement at age sixty if the member had continued to teach from the date of disability until age sixty at the same salary rate.\n\n10. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 169.010 to 169.141 to the contrary, from October 13, 1961, the contribution rate pursuant to sections 169.010 to 169.141 shall be multiplied by the factor of two-thirds for any member of the system for whom federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance tax is paid from state or local tax funds on account of the member's employment entitling the person to membership in the system. The monetary benefits for a member who elected not to exercise an option to pay into the system a retroactive contribution of four percent on that part of the member's annual salary rate which was in excess of four thousand eight hundred dollars but not in excess of eight thousand four hundred dollars for each year of employment in a position covered by this system between July 1, 1957, and July 1, 1961, as provided in subsection 10 of this section as it appears in RSMo, 1969, shall be the sum of:\n\n(1) For years of service prior to July 1, 1946, six-tenths of the full amount payable for years of membership service;\n\n(2) For years of membership service after July 1, 1946, in which the full contribution rate was paid, full benefits under the formula in effect at the time of the member's retirement;\n\n(3) For years of membership service after July 1, 1957, and prior to July 1, 1961, the benefits provided in this section as it appears in RSMo, 1959; except that if the member has at least thirty years of creditable service at retirement the member shall receive the benefit payable pursuant to that section as though the member's age were sixty-five at retirement;\n\n(4) For years of membership service after July 1, 1961, in which the two-thirds contribution rate was paid, two-thirds of the benefits under the formula in effect at the time of the member's retirement.\n\n11. The monetary benefits for each other member for whom federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance tax is or was paid at any time from state or local funds on account of the member's employment entitling the member to membership in the system shall be the sum of:\n\n(1) For years of service prior to July 1, 1946, six-tenths of the full amount payable for years of membership service;\n\n(2) For years of membership service after July 1, 1946, in which the full contribution rate was paid, full benefits under the formula in effect at the time of the member's retirement;\n\n(3) For years of membership service after July 1, 1957, in which the two-thirds contribution rate was paid, two-thirds of the benefits under the formula in effect at the time of the member's retirement.\n\n12. Any retired member of the system who was retired prior to September 1, 1972, or beneficiary receiving payments under option 1 or option 2 of subsection 3 of this section, as such option existed prior to September 1, 1972, will be eligible to receive an increase in the retirement allowance of the member of two percent for each year, or major fraction of more than one-half of a year, which the retired member has been retired prior to July 1, 1975. This increased amount shall be payable commencing with January, 1976, and shall thereafter be referred to as the member's retirement allowance. The increase provided for in this subsection shall not affect the retired member's eligibility for compensation provided for in section 169.580*or 169.585, nor shall the amount being paid pursuant to these sections be reduced because of any increases provided for in this section.\n\n13. If the board of trustees determines that the cost of living, as measured by generally accepted standards, increases two percent or more in the preceding fiscal year, the board shall increase the retirement allowances which the retired members or beneficiaries are receiving by two percent of the amount being received by the retired member or the beneficiary at the time the annual increase is granted by the board with the provision that the increases provided for in this subsection shall not become effective until the fourth January first following the member's retirement or January 1, 1977, whichever later occurs, or in the case of any member retiring on or after July 1, 2000, the increase provided for in this subsection shall not become effective until the third January first following the member's retirement, or in the case of any member retiring on or after July 1, 2001, the increase provided for in this subsection shall not become effective until the second January first following the member's retirement. Commencing with January 1, 1992, if the board of trustees determines that the cost of living has increased five percent or more in the preceding fiscal year, the board shall increase the retirement allowances by five percent. The total of the increases granted to a retired member or the beneficiary after December 31, 1976, may not exceed eighty percent of the retirement allowance established at retirement or as previously adjusted by other subsections. If the cost of living increases less than five percent, the board of trustees may determine the percentage of increase to be made in retirement allowances, but at no time can the increase exceed five percent per year. If the cost of living decreases in a fiscal year, there will be no increase in allowances for retired members on the following January first.\n\n14. The board of trustees may reduce the amounts which have been granted as increases to a member pursuant to subsection 13 of this section if the cost of living, as determined by the board and as measured by generally accepted standards, is less than the cost of living was at the time of the first increase granted to the member; except that, the reductions shall not exceed the amount of increases which have been made to the member's allowance after December 31, 1976.\n\n15. Any application for retirement shall include a sworn statement by the member certifying that the spouse of the member at the time the application was completed was aware of the application and the plan of retirement elected in the application.\n\n16. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person retired prior to September 28, 1983, who is receiving a reduced retirement allowance under option 1 or option 2 of subsection 3 of this section, as such option existed prior to September 28, 1983, and whose beneficiary nominated to receive continued retirement allowance payments under the elected option dies or has died, shall upon application to the board of trustees have his or her retirement allowance increased to the amount he or she would have been receiving had the option not been elected, actuarially adjusted to recognize any excessive benefits which would have been paid to him or her up to the time of application.\n\n17. Benefits paid pursuant to the provisions of the public school retirement system of Missouri shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415 of Title 26 of the United States Code except as provided pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the board of trustees may establish a benefit plan pursuant to Section 415(m) of Title 26 of the United States Code. Such plan shall be created solely for the purpose described in Section 415(m)(3)(A) of Title 26 of the United States Code. The board of trustees may promulgate regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection and to create and administer such benefit plan.\n\n18. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any person retired before, on, or after May 26, 1994, shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. As compensation for such duties the person shall receive an amount based on the person's years of service so that the total amount received pursuant to sections 169.010 to 169.141 shall be at least the minimum amounts specified in subdivisions (1) to (4) of this subsection. In determining the minimum amount to be received, the amounts in subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection shall be adjusted in accordance with the actuarial adjustment, if any, that was applied to the person's retirement allowance. In determining the minimum amount to be received, beginning September 1, 1996, the amounts in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be adjusted in accordance with the actuarial adjustment, if any, that was applied to the person's retirement allowance due to election of an optional form of retirement having a continued monthly payment after the person's death. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no person retired before, on, or after May 26, 1994, and no beneficiary of such a person, shall receive a retirement benefit pursuant to sections 169.010 to 169.141 based on the person's years of service less than the following amounts:\n\n(1) Thirty or more years of service, one thousand two hundred dollars;\n\n(2) At least twenty-five years but less than thirty years, one thousand dollars;\n\n(3) At least twenty years but less than twenty-five years, eight hundred dollars;\n\n(4) At least fifteen years but less than twenty years, six hundred dollars.\n\n19. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, any person retired prior to May 26, 1994, and any designated beneficiary of such a retired member who was deceased prior to July 1, 1999, shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement or aging and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. Beginning September 1, 1996, as compensation for such service, the member shall have added, pursuant to this subsection, to the member's monthly annuity as provided by this section a dollar amount equal to the lesser of sixty dollars or the product of two dollars multiplied by the member's number of years of creditable service. Beginning September 1, 1999, the designated beneficiary of the deceased member shall as compensation for such service have added, pursuant to this subsection, to the monthly annuity as provided by this section a dollar amount equal to the lesser of sixty dollars or the product of two dollars multiplied by the member's number of years of creditable service. The total compensation provided by this section including the compensation provided by this subsection shall be used in calculating any future cost-of-living adjustments provided by subsection 13 of this section.\n\n20. Any member who has retired prior to July 1, 1998, and the designated beneficiary of a deceased retired member shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. As compensation for such duties the person shall receive a payment equivalent to eight and seven-tenths percent of the previous month's benefit, which shall be added to the member's or beneficiary's monthly annuity and which shall not be subject to the provisions of subsections 13 and 14 of this section for the purposes of the limit on the total amount of increases which may be received.\n\n21. Any member who has retired shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such request. As compensation for such duties, the beneficiary of the retired member, or, if there is no beneficiary, the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the retired member, in that order of precedence, shall receive as a part of compensation for these duties a death benefit of five thousand dollars.\n\n22. Any member who has retired prior to July 1, 1999, and the designated beneficiary of a retired member who was deceased prior to July 1, 1999, shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. As compensation for such duties, the person shall have added, pursuant to this subsection, to the monthly annuity as provided by this section a dollar amount equal to five dollars times the member's number of years of creditable service.\n\n23. Any member who has retired prior to July 1, 2000, and the designated beneficiary of a deceased retired member shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. As compensation for such duties, the person shall receive a payment equivalent to three and five-tenths percent of the previous month's benefit, which shall be added to the member or beneficiary's monthly annuity and which shall not be subject to the provisions of subsections 13 and 14 of this section for the purposes of the limit on the total amount of increases which may be received.\n\n24. Any member who has retired prior to July 1, 2001, and the designated beneficiary of a deceased retired member shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging, and upon request shall give written or oral opinions to the board in response to such requests. As compensation for such duties, the person shall receive a dollar amount equal to three dollars times the member's number of years of creditable service, which shall be added to the member's or beneficiary's monthly annuity and which shall not be subject to the provisions of subsections 13 and 14 of this section for the purposes of the limit on the total amount of increases which may be received.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1353 § 7, A.L. 1949 p. 525, A.L. 1953 p. 480, A.L. 1957 p. 432, A.L. 1961 p. 367, A.L. 1967 p. 250, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1429, A.L. 1975 S.B. 149, A.L. 1977 H.B. 477, A.L. 1978 S.B. 542, A.L. 1980 S.B. 507, A.L. 1983 S.B. 3, A.L. 1984 S.B. 407, A.L. 1986 S.B. 616, A.L. 1987 H.B. 558, et al. merged with S.B. 264, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1100, et al., A.L. 1989 H.B. 610 merged with S.B. 146 merged with H.B. 600, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1347, et al., A.L. 1991 S.B. 242, et al., A.L. 1992 H.B. 926, A.L. 1993 S.B. 126, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1544 merged with S.B. 575, A.L. 1995 S.B. 378, A.L. 1996 S.B. 860, A.L. 1997 S.B. 309, A.L. 1998 S.B. 501, A.L. 1999 S.B. 308 & 314, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2001 H.B. 660, A.L. 2003 H.B. 346 & 174, A.L. 2005 H.B. 443, A.L. 2007 S.B. 406, A.L. 2009 H.B. 265, A.L. 2013 S.B. 17, A.L. 2023 S.B. 20 merged with S.B. 75)\n\n*Section 169.580 was repealed by H.B. 1608, 2012",

A surviving spouse, who is eligible for benefits pursuant to this subsection and also pursuant to subsection 3 of this section may receive benefits only pursuant to subsection 3 of this section as long as the surviving spouse remains eligible pursuant to both subsections, but shall not be disqualified for the benefit provided in this subsection because the surviving spouse may have received payments pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.

In lieu of receiving any benefit or lump sum from the retirement system, the designated beneficiary may elect under subsection 1 of this section to direct that each surviving dependent unmarried child, including a stepchild or adopted child, of the deceased member, under eighteen years of age, or such a child under age twenty-four if the child is enrolled in school on a full-time basis, shall be entitled to a monthly payment equal to sixteen and two-thirds percent of one-twelfth of the annual salary rate on which the member contributed for the member's last full year of creditable service as a teacher in a district included in the retirement system until death, marriage, adoption, or attainment of age eighteen or age twenty-four if enrolled in school on a full-time basis, whichever first occurs; provided that the monthly payment shall not be less than five hundred dollars or more than seven hundred twenty dollars, and provided further that any child of the deceased member who is disabled before attainment of age eighteen because of a physical or mental impairment which renders the child unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity and which disability continues after the child has attained age eighteen shall be entitled to a like monthly payment, until death, marriage, adoption, or recovery from the disability, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that the total of all monthly payments to the surviving dependent unmarried children shall in no event exceed two thousand one hundred sixty dollars.\n\n6.

If the other parent also is a dependent, as defined in this section, the same amount shall be paid to each until death.\n\n7. All else in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, a survivor may not be eligible to benefit pursuant to this section because of more than one terminated membership, and be it further provided that the board of trustees shall determine and decide all questions of doubt as to what constitutes dependency within the meaning of this section.\n\n8. The provisions added to subsection 3 of this section in 1991 are intended to clarify the scope and meaning of this section as originally enacted and shall be applied in all cases in which such an election has occurred or will occur.\n\n9. After July 1, 2000, all benefits payable pursuant to subsections 1 to 8 of this section shall be payable to eligible current and future survivor beneficiaries in accordance with this section.\n\n10. The system shall pay a monthly retirement allowance for the month in which a retired member, beneficiary or survivor receiving a retirement allowance or survivor benefit dies.\n\n11. If the total of all payments made under this section is less than the total of the member's accumulated contributions, the difference shall be paid to the person making the election under subsection 1 of this section. If such person does not survive until all payments are made under this section, such difference shall be paid in accordance with section 169.076.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1353 § 7, A.L. 1949 p. 525, A.L. 1953 p. 480 § 169.070, A.L. 1957 p. 432, A.L. 1967 p. 250, A.L. 1972 S.B. 491, A.L. 1975 S.B. 149, A.L. 1979 S.B. 40, A.L. 1984 S.B. 407, A.L. 1989 H.B. 600, A.L. 1991 S.B. 242, et al., A.L. 1993 S.B. 126, A.L. 1995 S.B. 378, A.L. 1996 S.B. 860, A.L. 1997 S.B. 309, A.L. 1999 S.B. 308 & 314, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2001 H.B. 660, A.L. 2005 H.B. 443, A.L. 2009 H.B. 265)\n\n(1973) Held that where surviving spouse was ineligible to elect monthly benefits and renounced right to receive accumulated contributions, surviving children became eligible to so elect.

The retirement allowance shall be the sum of the separate retirement allowances computed for each such period of service using the benefit formula in effect, the person's average final compensation as of the last day of such period of service and the creditable service the person earned during such period of service; provided, however, if the person earns at least four additional years of creditable service without another break in service, all of the person's creditable service prior to and including such service shall be aggregated and, upon retirement, the retirement allowance shall be computed using the benefit formula in effect and the person's average final compensation as of the last day of such period of four or more years and all of the creditable service the person earned prior to and during such period.\n\n6. Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, the amount of the annual service retirement allowance payable to any retirant pursuant to the provisions of sections 169.270 to 169.400, including any adjustments made pursuant to subsection 3 of this section, shall at all times comply with the provisions and limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\n\n7.

Until the first payment on account of any benefit becomes due, any retirant may elect, by delivering written notice duly acknowledged to the board of trustees, to receive the actuarial equivalent of the person's annual service retirement allowance or disability retirement allowance in the form of one of the options set forth below. No optional selection shall become effective in case a retirant dies within thirty days after retirement or within thirty days after filing such election; in such event the retirant shall be considered as an active member at the time of the retirant's death.\n\nUpon the person's death, the person's retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as the person shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and delivered to the board of trustees at or prior to the time of the person's retirement, provided that in the event the person's designated beneficiary predeceases the person, then the person's retirement allowance shall be adjusted at that time to the amount determined pursuant to subsection 1 of section 169.324 at the time of the retirement of the person, or\n\nUpon the person's death, one-half of the person's retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as the person shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at or prior to the time of the person's retirement, provided that in the event the person's designated beneficiary predeceases the person, then the person's retirement allowance shall be adjusted at that time to the amount determined under subsection 1 of section 169.324 at the time of the person's retirement, or\n\nUpon the person's death, no benefits shall be paid to any beneficiary or estate of the retired member. This optional benefit is actuarially increased over the benefit formula providing for benefits at death.\n\n2. If the death of any member who has not elected an option occurs before the person has received total benefits at least as large as accumulated contributions at retirement, the difference shall be paid in one lump sum to the person's designated beneficiary, if living, otherwise to the estate of the retired member.\n\n3. If an active member dies, or if an inactive member dies before retirement but after becoming eligible to retire and commence receiving retirement benefits, and a dependent of the member (spouse, dependent child under age nineteen or dependent parent) is designated as primary beneficiary to receive the member's accumulated contributions, the beneficiary may, in lieu thereof, at the beneficiary's option, request that the benefit be paid under option 1 in subsection 1 of this section as if the member had retired as of the date of death and designated such beneficiary as the option 1 beneficiary; except that if the beneficiary is a dependent child, the option 1 benefit shall be payable only until the child attains age nineteen and not throughout the life of such child. If the designated beneficiary elects the option 1 benefit and if the member was an active member at the time of death, such benefit shall be calculated as if the deceased member had, at the time of death, at least ten years' creditable service.

All of the assets of the retirement system (other than tangible real or personal property owned by the retirement system for use in carrying out its duties, such as office supplies and furniture) shall be credited, according to the purpose for which they are held, in either the employees' contribution fund or the general reserve fund.\n\n(1) The employees' contribution fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated the contributions of the members. The employer shall, except as provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, cause to be deducted from the compensation of each member on each and every payroll, for each and every payroll period, the pro rata portion of five and nine-tenths percent of his annualized compensation. Effective January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2013, the employer shall deduct an additional one and six-tenths percent of the member's annualized compensation. For 2014 and for each subsequent year, the employer shall deduct from each member's annualized compensation the rate of contribution determined for such year as provided in subsections 4, 5, and 6 of this section.\n\n(2) The employer shall pay all such deductions and any amount it may elect to pay pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection to the retirement system at once. The retirement system shall credit such deductions and such amounts to the individual account of each member from whose compensation the deduction was made or with respect to whose compensation the amount was paid pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection. In determining the deduction for a member in any payroll period, the board of trustees may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such period.\n\n(3) The deductions provided for herein are declared to be a part of the compensation of the member and the making of such deductions shall constitute payments by the member out of the person's compensation and such deductions shall be made notwithstanding that the amount actually paid to the member after such deductions is less than the minimum compensation provided by law for any member. Every member shall be deemed to consent to the deductions made and provided for herein, and shall receipt for the person's full compensation, and the making of the deduction and the payment of compensation less the deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for services rendered during the period covered by the payment except as to benefits provided by sections 169.270 to 169.400.\n\n(4) The accumulated contributions with interest of a member withdrawn by the person or paid to the person's estate or designated beneficiary in the event of the person's death before retirement shall be paid from the employees' contribution fund. Upon retirement of a member the member's accumulated contributions with interest shall be transferred from the employees' contribution fund to the general reserve fund.\n\n(5) The employer may elect to pay on behalf of all members all or part of the amount that the members would otherwise be required to contribute to the employees' contribution fund pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. Such amounts paid by the employer shall be in lieu of members' contributions and shall be treated for all purposes of sections 169.270 to 169.400 as contributions made by members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, no member shall be entitled to receive such amounts directly. The election shall be made by a duly adopted resolution of the employer's board and shall remain in effect for at least one year from the effective date thereof. The election may be thereafter terminated only by an affirmative act of the employer's board notwithstanding any limitation in the term thereof in the adopting resolution. Any such termination resolution shall be adopted at least sixty days prior to the effective date thereof, and the effective date thereof shall coincide with a fiscal year-end of the employer.

Beginning in 2013, the actuary for the retirement system shall annually calculate the rate of employer contributions and member contributions for 2014 and for each subsequent calendar year through 2018, expressed as a level percentage of the annualized compensation of the members, subject to the following:\n\n(1) The rate of contribution for any calendar year shall be determined based on an actuarial valuation of the retirement system as of the first day of the prior calendar year. Such actuarial valuation shall be performed using the actuarial cost method and actuarial assumptions adopted by the board of trustees and in accordance with accepted actuarial standards of practice in effect at the time the valuation is performed, as promulgated by the actuarial standards board or its successor;\n\n(2) The target combined employer and member contribution rate shall be the amount actuarially required to cover the normal cost and amortize any unfunded accrued actuarial liability over a period that shall not exceed thirty years from the date of the valuation;\n\n(3) The target combined rate as so determined shall be allocated equally between the employer contribution rate and the member contribution rate, provided, however, that the level rate of contributions to be paid by the employers and the level rate of contributions to be deducted from the compensation of members for any calendar*year shall each be limited as follows:\n\n(a) The contribution rate shall not be less than seven and one-half percent;\n\n(b) The contribution rate shall not exceed nine percent; and\n\n(c) Changes in the contribution rate from year to year shall be in increments of one-half percent such that the contribution rate for any year shall not be greater than or less than the rate in effect for the prior year by more than one-half percent;\n\n(4) The board of trustees shall certify to the employers the contribution rate for the following calendar year no later than six months prior to the date such rate is to be effective.\n\n5. The member contribution rate for 2019 and subsequent periods shall be nine percent of compensation unless a lower member contribution rate applies for any period beginning on or after July 1, 2021, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (4) of subsection 6 of this section.\n\n6. The employer contribution rate for calendar year 2019 shall be ten and one-half percent. The employer contribution rate for the eighteen-month period beginning January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021, shall be twelve percent. For the twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2021, and for each subsequent twelve-month period beginning July first each year, the employer contribution rate shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) The actuary shall determine the total actuarially required contribution based on an actuarial valuation of the retirement system as of the first day of the preceding calendar year. Such actuarial valuation shall be performed using the actuarial cost method and actuarial assumptions adopted by the board of trustees and in accordance with actuarial standards of practice applicable as of the valuation date. The total actuarially required contribution rate, including both employer and member contributions, shall be an amount determined in accordance with the board's current funding policy, expressed as a level percentage of the annualized compensation of the members;\n\n(2) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the first day of the preceding calendar year is below one hundred percent, the employer contribution rate shall be the greater of twelve percent or the difference between the total actuarially required contribution rate and the nine percent member contribution rate, subject to the limits on annual adjustments stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;\n\n(3) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the first day of the preceding calendar year equals or exceeds one hundred percent and the total actuarially required contribution rate exceeds eighteen percent, the employer contribution rate shall be the difference between the total actuarially required contribution rate and the nine percent member contribution rate, subject to the limits on annual adjustments stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;\n\n(4) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the first day of the preceding calendar year equals or exceeds one hundred percent and the total actuarially required contribution rate does not exceed eighteen percent, the total actuarially required contribution rate shall be allocated equally between the employer contribution rate and the member contribution rate. If the total actuarially required contribution rate falls below eighteen percent after being above eighteen percent for the preceding twelve-month period, the member contribution rate and the employer contribution rate shall be adjusted to one-half of the total actuarially required contribution rate for such period, regardless of the magnitude of the decrease from the rate in effect for the prior period, in order to equalize the employer and member contribution rates. Otherwise, adjustments in the contribution rates shall be limited by the annual adjustment limits stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;\n\n(5) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the first day of the preceding calendar year again falls below one hundred percent, or if the total actuarially required contribution rate rises above eighteen percent, the provisions of subdivision (2) or (3) of this subsection shall apply, as applicable, subject to the limits on annual adjustments stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;\n\n(6) Except as stated in subdivision (4) of this subsection, in transitioning to the contribution rates prescribed in this subsection for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2021, the employer contribution rate and the member contribution rate, respectively, shall not increase by more than one percent or decrease by more than one-half percent for any period from the corresponding rate in effect immediately before such increase or decrease; and\n\n(7) The board of trustees shall certify to the employers the contribution rate to be effective for July 1, 2021, and for each following July first, no later than six months prior to the date such rate is to be effective.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 787 § 9, A.L. 1951 p. 477, A.L. 1957 p. 396, A.L. 1961 p. 369, A.L. 1965 p. 291, A.L. 1967 lst Ex.

The members of such board of trustees appointed by the board of education may be members of the board of education or other individuals deemed qualified to hold such positions by the board of education;\n\n(2) Four trustees to be elected for terms of four years by and from the active members of the retirement system who shall hold office as trustees only while active members; provided, however, that their terms shall be fixed so that the terms of one of the trustees so elected shall expire each year; and provided further, that not more than two of such persons shall be teachers and two shall be nonteachers.

The appointment of the trustees shall be subject to the same rules and regulations applicable to other trustees, including, but not limited to, taking an oath of office as provided in subsection 5 of this section.\n\n2. If a vacancy occurs in the office of trustee, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled.

In the event of a lapse of a school district's corporate organization as described in subsections 1 and 4 of section 162.081, or for any other reason, the general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system shall continue to be fully vested in the trustees then currently serving and such trustees shall continue to serve and be elected in the same manner as set forth in this statute as if no lapse had occurred, except that in the event of vacancies occurring in the office of trustees appointed by the board of education prior to the lapse, the board of trustees shall appoint a qualified person or persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies for terms of up to four years.\n\n4.

Such oath shall be subscribed to by the trustee making it and filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court.\n\n6. The circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the school district is located shall have jurisdiction over the members of the board of trustees to require them to account for their official conduct in the management and disposition of the funds and property committed to their charge; to order, decree and compel payment by them to the public school retirement system of their school district of all sums of money, and of the value of all property which may have been improperly retained by them, or transferred to others, or which may have been lost or wasted by any violation of their duties or abuse of their powers as such members of such board; to remove any such member upon proof that the trustee has abused the trustee's trust or has violated the duties of the trustee's office; to restrain and prevent any alienation or disposition of property of such public school retirement system by the members, in cases where it may be threatened, or there is good reason to apprehend that it is intended to be made in fraud of the rights and interests of such public school retirement system. The jurisdiction conferred by sections 169.410 to 169.540 shall be exercised as in ordinary cases upon petition, filed by the board of education of such school district, or by any two members of the board of trustees. Such petition shall be heard in a summary manner after ten days' notice in writing to the member complained of, and an appeal shall lie from the judgment of the circuit court as in other causes and be speedily determined, but such appeal shall not operate under any condition as a supersedeas of a judgment of removal from office.\n\n7.

The board of trustees shall elect from its membership a chairman and shall, by majority vote of its members, appoint a secretary, who may be, but need not be, one of its members. It shall engage such actuarial and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the retirement system. It shall also engage an investment counselor who shall be experienced in the investment of moneys to advise the trustees on investments of the retirement system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board of trustees and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the retirement system shall be paid at such rates and in such amounts as the board of trustees shall approve.\n\n10. The board of trustees shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for actuarial valuations of the assets of the retirement system and for checking the experience of the system.\n\n11. The board of trustees shall keep a record of all its proceedings which shall be open to public inspection. It shall prepare annually and send to the board of education and to each member of the retirement system a report showing the fiscal transactions of the retirement system for the preceding fiscal year, a detailed listing of all salaries and expenditures incurred by the trustees for its operation, the amount of the accumulated cash and securities of the system, and the last balance sheet showing the financial condition of the system by means of an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system. The board of trustees shall also prepare or cause to be prepared an annual report concerning the operation of the retirement system herein provided for, which report shall be sent by the chairman of the board of trustees to the board of education.\n\n12. The board of trustees shall arrange for necessary legal advice for the operation of the retirement system.\n\n13. The board of trustees shall designate a medical board to be composed of three physicians, none of whom shall be eligible for benefits pursuant to sections 169.410 to 169.540, who shall arrange for and pass upon all medical examinations required pursuant to the provisions of sections 169.410 to 169.540, shall investigate all essential statements and certificates made by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for disability retirement and shall report in writing to the board of trustees its conclusions and recommendations upon all matters referred to it.\n\n14. The actuary shall be the technical adviser of the board of trustees on matters regarding the operation of the system created by sections 169.410 to 169.540 and shall perform such other duties as are required in connection therewith. Such person shall be qualified as an actuary by membership as a fellow in the Society of Actuaries or by objective standards which are no less stringent than those established by the Society of Actuaries.\n\n15. At least once in each five-year period the actuary shall make an investigation into the actuarial experience of the retirement system, and taking into account the results of such investigation of the experience, the board of trustees shall adopt for the retirement system such actuarial assumptions as shall be deemed necessary.\n\n16. On the basis of such actuarial assumptions as the board of trustees shall adopt, the actuary shall make an annual valuation of the assets and liabilities of the funds of the retirement system.\n\n17. On the basis of the valuation the board of trustees shall certify the rates of contribution payable by the board of education.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 805 § 5, A.L. 1953 pp. 438, 496, A.L. 1957 p. 462, A.L. 1961 p. 384, A.L. 1967 p. 263, A.L. 1978 S.B. 542, A.L. 1981 H.B. 33, et al., A.L. 1987 H.B. 558, et al., A.L. 1996 S.B. 860, A.L. 1999 H.B. 979, A.L. 2001 H.B. 660, A.L. 2025 H.B. 147)\n\n*Words \"Missouri Public Charter School Association\" appears in original rolls.",

Retirement, when — pensions, how computed — early retirement, when, pensions, how computed — disability retirement, when, pensions, how computed — death before retirement, effect of — beneficiary defined, benefits, how computed — retirants may become active, how — minimum benefits, when. —1. Any member may retire and receive a normal pension upon his or her written application to the board of trustees setting forth at what time not less than fifteen days nor more than one hundred eighty days subsequent to the execution and filing of such application he or she desires to be retired; provided, that the member at the time so specified for his or her retirement either (a) shall have attained age sixty-five or (b) shall have attained an age which when added to the number of years of credited service of such member shall total a sum not less than eighty. For purposes of computing any member's age under this section, the board shall, if necessary, add to his or her actual age any accumulated and unused days of sick leave included in his or her credited service.\n\n2. Upon retirement under subsection 1 of this section, a member shall receive an annual pension payable in monthly installments in the following manner:\n\n(1) A member hired prior to January 1, 2018, shall receive an annual pension payable in monthly installments equal to his or her number of years of credited service multiplied by two percent of his or her average final compensation subject to a maximum pension of sixty percent of his or her average final compensation; or\n\n(2) A member hired for the first time on or after January 1, 2018, shall receive an annual pension payable in monthly installments equal to his or her number of years of credited service multiplied by one and three-fourths percent of such member's average final compensation subject to a maximum pension of sixty percent of the member's average final compensation.\n\n3. A member who is not eligible for normal pension pursuant to subsection 1 of this section but who has attained age sixty and has five or more years of credited service may make application in the same manner as pursuant to subsection 1 of this section for an early pension. His or her early pension shall be computed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section, but shall be reduced by five-ninths of one percent for each month such member's early retirement date precedes the earliest date he or she could have received a normal pension pursuant to subsection 1 of this section had his or her service continued.\n\n4. Upon the written application of the member or of the employing board, any active member who has five or more years of credited service with such board and does not qualify for a normal pension pursuant to subsection 1 of this section may be retired by the board of trustees, not less than fifteen days and not more than one hundred eighty days next following the date of filing such application, and receive a disability pension, provided, that the medical board after a medical examination of such member or such member's medical records shall certify that such member is unable to further perform his or her duties due to mental or physical incapacity, and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent and that such member should be retired; or, provided the member furnishes evidence of the receipt of disability benefits under the federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance System of the Social Security Act. The determination of the board of trustees in the matter shall be final and conclusive. A member being retired pursuant to this subsection who has accumulated unused vacation and sick leave may elect to have the commencement of his or her disability pension deferred for more than one hundred eighty days during the period he or she is entitled to vacation and sick pay.\n\n5. Upon retirement for disability, a member shall receive a disability pension until such time as he or she meets the requirements for a normal pension pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, at which time his or her disability pension will be deemed to be a normal pension. The member's disability pension shall be the larger of:\n\n(1) A normal pension based on his or her credited service to the date of his or her retirement for disability and calculated as if he or she were age sixty-five; or\n\n(2) One-fourth of his or her average final compensation; except that such benefit shall not exceed the normal pension which he or she would have received upon retirement if his or her service had continued and he or she had satisfied the eligibility requirements of subsection 1 of this section and had his or her final average compensation been unchanged.\n\n6. Once each year during the first five years following retirement for disability and once in every three-year period thereafter while receiving a disability pension, the board of trustees may, and shall, require any member receiving a disability pension who has not yet become eligible for a normal pension pursuant to subsection 1 of this section to undergo a medical examination at a place designated by the medical board or by a physician or physicians designated by such board. If any such member receiving a disability pension refuses to submit to such medical examination, his or her benefit may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and if his or her refusal continues for one year, all rights in and to his or her pension may be revoked by the board of trustees.\n\n7. If the board of trustees finds that any member receiving a disability pension is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his or her disability pension plus benefits, if any, to which he or she and his or her family are eligible under the federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance System of the Social Security Act and the current rate of monthly compensation for the position he or she held at retirement, then the amount of his or her disability pension shall be reduced to an amount which together with the amount earnable by him or her shall equal such current rate of monthly compensation. The decisions of the board of trustees in regard to such modification of disability benefits shall be final and conclusive.\n\n8. If any member receiving a disability pension is restored to service as an employee, he or she shall again become an active member of the retirement system and contribute thereunder. His or her credited service at the time of his or her retirement for disability shall be restored and the excess of his or her accumulated contributions at his or her retirement for disability over the total disability pension payments which he or she received shall be credited to his or her account.\n\n9. If a member with fewer than five years credited service ceases to be an employee, except by death, he or she shall be paid the amount of his or her accumulated contributions in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n10. If a member with five years or more credited service ceases to be an employee, except by death or retirement, he or she shall be paid on demand the amount of his or her accumulated contributions, or he or she may leave his or her accumulated contributions with the retirement system and be an inactive member and claim a retirement benefit at any time after he or she reaches the minimum age for retirement, except that if such a member's accumulated contributions do not exceed the involuntary distribution limits under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the member must elect to become an inactive member within thirty days of employment separation to avoid application of the involuntary distribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. When an inactive member presents his or her valid claim to the board of trustees, he or she shall be granted a benefit at such time and for such amount as is available pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of this section in accordance with the provisions of law in effect at the time his or her active membership ceased. The accumulated contributions of an inactive member may be withdrawn at any time upon ninety days' notice or such shorter notice as is approved by the board of trustees. If an inactive member dies before retirement, his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid to his or her designated beneficiary, if living, otherwise to the estate of the member. A member's accumulated contributions shall not be paid to him or her so long as he or she remains in service as an employee.\n\n11. Any member upon retirement shall receive his or her pension payable throughout life subject to the provision that if his or her death occurs before he or she has received total benefits at least as large as his or her accumulated contributions at retirement, the difference shall be paid in one sum to his or her designated beneficiary, if living, otherwise to the estate of the retired member.\n\n12. Prior to the date of retirement pursuant to subsection 2, 3, or 4 of this section, a member may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her pension in a lesser amount, payable throughout life under one of the following options with the provision that:\n\nUpon his or her death, his or her pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to his or her beneficiary, or\n\nUpon his or her death, one-half of his or her pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to his or her beneficiary, or\n\nUpon his or her death, his or her pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to his or her beneficiary, provided that in the event his or her designated beneficiary predeceases him or her, then his or her pension shall be adjusted effective the first day of the month following the month in which his or her designated beneficiary died to the amount determined pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of this section at the time of his or her retirement, or\n\nUpon his or her death, one-half of his or her pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to his or her beneficiary, provided that in the event his or her designated beneficiary predeceases him or her, then his or her pension shall be adjusted effective the first day of the month following the month in which his or her designated beneficiary died to the amount determined pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of this section at the time of his or her retirement.\n\nPrior to age sixty-two the member will receive an increased pension, where the total pension prior to age sixty-two is approximately equal to the pension after age sixty-two plus the member's estimated federal Social Security benefit, provided that the reduced pension after age sixty-two is not less than one-half the pension the member could have received had no option been elected.\n\n­­A member may elect a combination of option l and option 5, or option 2 and option 5. The survivor benefits payable to a beneficiary, other than the spouse of the retired member, under any of the foregoing options shall in no event exceed fifty percent of the actuarial equivalent of the pension determined pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of this section at the time of retirement.\n\n13. If an option has been elected pursuant to subsection 12 of this section, and both the retired member and beneficiary die before receiving total benefits as large as the member's accumulated contributions at retirement, the difference shall be paid to the designated beneficiary of the person last entitled to benefits, if living, otherwise to the estate of the person last entitled to benefits.\n\n14. If an active member dies while an employee and with five or more years of credited service and a dependent of the member is designated as beneficiary to receive his or her accumulated contributions, such beneficiary may, in lieu thereof, request that benefits be paid under option 1, subsection 12 of this section, as if the member had attained age sixty, if the member was less than sixty years of age at the time of his or her death, and had retired under such option as of the date of death, provided that under the same circumstances a member may provide by written designation that benefits must be paid pursuant to option 1 to such beneficiary. In addition to benefits received under option 1, subsection 12 of this section, a surviving spouse receiving benefits under this subsection shall receive sixty dollars per month for each unmarried dependent child of the deceased member who is under twenty-two years of age and is in the care of the surviving spouse; provided, that if there are more than three such unmarried dependent children one hundred eighty dollars shall be divided equally among them. A\"dependent beneficiary\"for the purpose of this subsection only shall mean either the surviving spouse or a person who at the time of the death of the member was receiving at least one-half of his or her support from the member, and the determination of the board of trustees as to whether a person is a dependent shall be final.\n\n15. In lieu of accepting the payment of the accumulated contributions of a member who dies after having at least eighteen months of credited service and while an employee, an eligible beneficiary or, if no surviving eligible beneficiary, the unmarried dependent children of the member under twenty-two years of age may elect to receive the benefits pursuant to subdivision (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection. An\"eligible beneficiary\"is the surviving spouse, unmarried dependent children under twenty-two years of age or dependent parents of the member, if designated as beneficiary. A\"dependent\"is one receiving at least one-half of his or her support from the member at his or her death.\n\n(1) A surviving spouse who is sixty-two years of age at the death of the member or upon becoming such age thereafter, and who was married to the member at least one year, may receive sixty dollars per month for life. A spouse may receive this benefit after receiving benefits pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) A surviving spouse who has in his or her care an unmarried dependent child of the deceased member under twenty-two years of age may receive sixty dollars per month plus sixty dollars per month for each child under twenty-two years of age but not more than a total of two hundred forty dollars per month.\n\n(3) If no benefits are payable pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, unmarried dependent children under the age of twenty-two may receive sixty dollars each per month; provided that if there are more than three such children one hundred eighty dollars per month shall be divided equally among them.\n\n(4) A dependent parent upon attaining sixty-two years of age may receive sixty dollars per month as long as not remarried provided no benefits are payable at any time pursuant to subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection. If there are two dependent parents entitled to benefits, sixty dollars per month shall be divided equally between them.\n\n(5) If the benefits pursuant to this subsection are elected and the total amount paid is less than an amount equal to the accumulated contributions of a member at his or her death, the difference shall be payable to the beneficiary or the estate of the beneficiary last entitled to benefits.\n\n16. If a member receiving a normal pension again becomes an active member, his or her pension benefit payments shall cease during such membership and shall be resumed upon subsequent retirement together with such pension benefit as shall accrue by reason of his or her latest period of membership. Except as otherwise provided in section 105.269, a retired member may not receive a pension benefit for any month for which he or she receives compensation from an employing board, except he or she may serve as a part-time or temporary employee for not to exceed sixty days in any calendar year without becoming a member and without having his or her pension benefit discontinued. A retired member may also serve as a member of the board of trustees and receive any reimbursement for expenses allowed him or her because of such service without becoming an active member and without having his or her pension benefit discontinued or reduced.\n\n17. Upon approval of the board of trustees, any member may make contributions in addition to those required. Any additional contributions shall be accumulated at interest and paid in addition to the benefits provided hereunder. The board of trustees shall make such rules and regulations as it deems appropriate in connection with additional contributions including limitations on amounts of contributions and methods of payment of benefits.\n\n18. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any member retiring on or after age sixty-five who has five or more years of credited service shall be entitled to an annual pension of the lesser of (a) an amount equal to his or her number of years of credited service multiplied by one hundred twenty dollars, or (b) one thousand eight hundred dollars. Upon the death of such member, any benefits payable to the beneficiary of such member shall be computed as otherwise provided.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 805 § 6, A.L. 1949 p. 532, A.L. 1953 p. 438, A.L. 1957 p. 462, A.L. 1961 p. 384, A.L. 1965 p. 293, A.L. 1967 p. 263, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1266, A.L. 1973 S.B. 256, A.L. 1978 S.B. 542, A.L. 1979 S.B. 392, A.L. 1981 H.B. 33, et al., A.L. 1983 S.B. 3, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1216, A.L. 1987 H.B. 558, et al. merged with H.B. 384 Revision, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1100, et al., A.L. 1989 S.B. 146, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1347, et al., A.L. 2001 H.B. 660, A.L. 2017 S.B. 62)",

In determining the amount earnable by a member in any payroll period, the board of trustees may consider the rate of earnable compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period; it may omit deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if the employee was not a member on the first day of the payroll period; and to facilitate the making of the deductions, it may modify the deduction required of any member by such amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the compensation upon the basis of which such deduction was made.\n\n(5) The deductions provided for herein are declared to be a part of the salary of the member and the making of such deductions shall constitute payments by the member out of his or her salary or earnings and such deductions shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent to the deductions made and provided for herein, and shall receipt for his or her full salary or compensation, and the making of said deductions and the payment of salary or compensation less said deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for services rendered during the period covered by the payment except as to benefits provided by sections 169.410 to 169.540.\n\n(6) The employing board may elect to pay member contributions required by this section as an employer pick up of employee contributions under Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such contributions picked up by the employing board shall be treated as contributions made by members for all purposes of sections 169.410 to 169.540.\n\n3.

If the employer does not utilize a salary schedule, or if the position in question is not subject to the employer's salary schedule, a retiree employed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection may earn up to fifty percent of the annual compensation paid to the person or persons who last held such position or positions, or may earn up to fifty percent of the limit set for the position by the school board of the employer which has been submitted and approved by the board of trustees of the retirement system.

In addition, such person shall contribute to the retirement system if the person satisfies the retirement system's membership eligibility requirements.

The board may enter into an agreement with the board of trustees of any community college district, which maintains a local retirement system for its employees who are not members of the public school retirement system of Missouri, to provide for the merger of the local retirement system into the system and, in connection with such merger, for the transfer of assets and liabilities from the local retirement system to the system, the inclusion of members of the local retirement system and all other eligible employees as members of the system, and the continuation of retirement, disability and death benefits to former members and beneficiaries of former members of the local retirement system by the system.\n\n2. The merger agreement shall require membership in the system as of the effective date of the merger for all employees of the community college district who meet the definition of \"employee\" as set forth in section 169.600, RSMo 1978, including any employees who may not be members of the local retirement system as of the date of the merger agreement.\n\n3.

Contributions by members and employers — rate — penalty for failure to remit — benefits to be reduced, when — purchase of service credit, certain members, how. —1. The funds required for the operation of the retirement system created by sections 169.600 to 169.715 shall come from contributions made in equal amounts by employees as herein defined and their employers, beginning November 1, 1965, and from such interest or income as may be derived from the investment of funds of the system. All contributions shall be transmitted to the board of trustees by employers in such manner and at such times as the board by rule shall require.\n\n2. For each school year following the date on which the system becomes operative, each and every employer of one or more persons who are members of the system shall transmit to the board of trustees, in the manner and accompanied by such supporting data as the board shall prescribe, twice the amount that is deductible from the pay of such employee or employees during the school year. Failure or refusal to transmit such amount as required shall render the person or persons responsible therefor individually liable for twice the amount so withheld. Suits for the recovery of amounts for which individuals are thus rendered liable shall be instituted and prosecuted by the board of trustees in the name of the retirement system. In addition to such civil penalty, and not in lieu thereof, any person or persons made responsible for the remittance of contributions who shall willfully and knowingly fail or refuse to transmit such contributions or any part thereof to the board of trustees shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars and not more than two hundred dollars. Each day such person or persons shall so fail or refuse to transmit such contributions shall be deemed a separate offense. The board of trustees may request the employer to provide the information necessary to administer the system and to advise each member of such member's status.\n\n3. The contributions of members of the retirement system shall be collected by their employers through appropriate deductions from paychecks. The total amount deducted from the paychecks of members during any school year shall equal such a percent of their salary rates as may be required by the contribution rate then in effect. For contribution purposes any annual salary rate less than one thousand two hundred dollars shall be regarded as one thousand two hundred dollars. Contributions transmitted to the retirement system before February 20, 1996, based on salary rates which either included or excluded employer-paid medical benefits for members, shall be deemed to have been in compliance with this section. The retirement system shall not refund or adjust contributions or adjust benefit determinations with respect to any period before February 20, 1996, solely because of the treatment of employer-paid medical benefits for members. Effective December 31, 1995, compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of Title 26 of the United States Code shall be disregarded for purposes of determining contributions pursuant to this section and calculating benefits paid by the public education employee retirement system of Missouri. The limitation on compensation for eligible employees shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account under the system as in effect on July 1, 1993. For the purpose of this subsection, an\"eligible employee\"is an individual who was a member of the system before July 1, 1996.\n\n4. The board of trustees shall fix and certify to the employers the level rate of contribution subject to the following:\n\n(1) The level rate of contribution for a fiscal year shall not exceed the level rate of contribution for the prior fiscal year by more than one-quarter percent;\n\n(2) The board shall fix and certify to the employers the rate of contribution for a fiscal year no later than six months prior to the date such rate is to be effective;\n\n(3) The board shall fix and certify to the employers the rate of contribution for a fiscal year based on an actuarial valuation of the system as of a date not earlier than the last day of the second prior fiscal year. Such actuarial valuation of the system shall be performed using processes and actuarial assumptions that are in accordance with actuarial standards of practice in effect at the time the valuation is performed, as promulgated by the actuarial standards board or its successor; provided that such actuarial valuation shall be based on the entry age normal actuarial cost method and an asset valuation method based on the market value of system assets that may provide for smoothing of investment gains and losses, and further, that the level rate of contribution shall be the total of the normal cost and a rate which shall amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability over a period that shall not exceed thirty years from the date of the valuation, subject to the limitations of this subsection; and\n\n(4) Not less than once every ten years the board shall have an actuary, other than the actuary performing the actuarial valuation pursuant to this section, review such actuarial valuation and perform an additional actuarial valuation of the system.\n\n5. Regardless of the provisions of any law governing compensation and contracts, every employee shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions provided herein. Payment of salary or compensation less such deduction shall be a full and complete discharge of all salary or compensation claims and demands during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits provided pursuant to sections 169.600 to 169.715.\n\n6. A person serving as an employee as defined in section 169.600, who became a member after November 1, 1965, and before July 1, 1974, and who was regularly employed to serve for twenty or more hours per week at some time during the period November 1, 1965, to July 1, 1974, may receive membership service credit for such service by paying into the system the amount, with interest at such rate as may be set by the board within the limits set by law for interest rates, the person would have contributed had the person been eligible for membership.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 169.600 to 169.715 to the contrary, no legislation shall be enacted after July 1, 2003, that increases benefits provided to members or retirees of the public education employee retirement system of Missouri above that which may be funded using a rate of contribution of five percent as determined using an actuarial valuation as provided in subsection 4 of this section; provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, legislation may be enacted after July 1, 2003, that provides for an extension of time within which a member may make an election pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 169.670.\n\n(L. 1965 p. 298 § 3, A.L. 1969 p. 284, A.L. 1973 H.B. 411, A.L. 1975 H.B. 352, A.L. 1977 H.B. 135, A.L. 1981 S.B. 242, A.L. 1991 S.B. 242, et al., A.L. 1995 S.B. 378, A.L. 1996 S.B. 857, A.L. 1997 S.B. 309, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2003 H.B. 346 & 174, A.L. 2005 H.B. 443)",

All funds arising from the operation of sections 169.600 to 169.715 shall belong to the retirement system created in sections 169.600 to 169.715 and shall be controlled by the board of trustees and that board shall provide for the collection of these funds, see that they are safely preserved, and shall permit their disbursement only for the purposes authorized in sections 169.600 to 169.715. These funds are declared and shall be deemed to be the moneys and funds of this retirement system and not general funds of the state and shall not be commingled with any state funds or other retirement funds. Solely for the purpose of investing the funds of the retirement system, the funds may be combined with the funds of the public school retirement system of Missouri, but the funds of each system shall be accounted for separately and for all other purposes shall be separate.\n\n2.

All investments shall be made for the account of the retirement system, and any securities or other properties obtained by the board of trustees may be held by a custodian in the name of the retirement system, or in the name of a nominee in order to facilitate the expeditious transfer of such securities or other property. Such securities or other properties which are not available in registered form may be held in bearer form or in book entry form. The retirement system is further authorized to deposit, or have deposited for its account, eligible securities in a central depository system or clearing corporation or in a federal reserve bank under a book entry system as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code, sections 400.8-102 and 400.8-108. When such eligible securities of the retirement system are so deposited with a central depository system, the securities may be merged and held in the name of the nominee of such securities depository and title to such securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of such securities depository or federal reserve bank without physical delivery of the certificates or documents representing such securities.\n\n5.

Any member who rendered service prior to November 1, 1965, as an employee as defined in section 169.600 in a district or community college district included in the system may claim credit for that service by filing with the board of trustees a complete and detailed record of the service for which the credit is claimed, together with such supporting evidence as the board may require for verification of the record.

The reinstatement shall be effected by the member paying to the retirement system, with interest, the amount of accumulated contributions withdrawn by the member or refunded to the member with respect to the service being reinstated. A member may reinstate less than the total service previously forfeited, in accordance with rules promulgated by the board of trustees.

Members who have accrued at least one year of membership service credit for employment in a position covered by this retirement system and who have covered employment with this retirement system following the service for which credit is being purchased may purchase membership service credit under the circumstances, terms and conditions provided in this section. With respect to each such purchase authorized by this section the following provisions apply:\n\n(1) The purchase shall be effected by the member paying to the retirement system the amount the member would have contributed and the amount the employer would have contributed had such member been an employee for the number of years for which the member is electing to purchase credit, and had the member's compensation during such period been the highest annual salary rate on record with the retirement system on the date of election to purchase credit. The contribution rate used in determining the amount to be paid shall be the contribution rate in effect on the date of election to purchase credit. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, for all elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system on or after January 1, 2006, the member shall receive credit based on the amount paid by the member for such credit and received by the retirement system by the close of business on June thirtieth of each year. In lieu of charging the member interest on such purchase of credit, the amount to be paid by the member for any remaining credit the member has elected to purchase but has not paid for by September thirtieth of each year shall be recalculated on the following October first using the contribution rate in effect on that July first and the highest salary of record for the member as of that July first. For all elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system prior to January 1, 2006, the retirement system shall determine the cost of such purchase using the calculation method in effect for elections to purchase credit received by the retirement system on or after January 1, 2006, provided that the member shall have a one-time, irrevocable option to continue to have the cost of such purchase be determined using the calculation method in effect at the time of such election to purchase such credit. To be effective, such option must be elected by the member on a form approved by the retirement system and such form must be received by the retirement system by the close of business on June 30, 2006. The retirement system reserves the right to prohibit a purchase, impose additional requirements for making a purchase, or limit the amount of credit purchased if necessary for the retirement system to comply with federal law, including but not limited to, the provisions of Section 415 of Title 26 of the United States Code.

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2009, shall be invalid and void;\n\n(2) Membership service credit purchased pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be membership service as defined in subdivision (10) of section 169.600;\n\n(3) An election to purchase membership service credit pursuant to this section and payment for the purchase shall be completed prior to termination of membership with the retirement system with interest on the unpaid balance;\n\n(4) Members may purchase membership service credit in increments of one-tenth of a year, and multiple elections to purchase may be made;\n\n(5) Additional terms and conditions applicable to purchases made pursuant to this section including, but not limited to, minimum payments, payment schedules and provisions applicable when a member fails to complete payment may be set by rules of the board.\n\n2. Membership service credit shall not be allowed pursuant to this section or sections 169.570 and 169.577 which exceeds in length the member's membership service credit for employment in a position covered by this system, and in no event may the member receive membership service credit with both this system and another public retirement system for the same service.\n\n3. A member who was employed for at least twenty hours per week on a regular basis by a public school district, public community college, public college, or public university, either inside or outside of this state, may elect to purchase equivalent membership service credit.\n\n4. A member who has served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America and who was discharged or separated from the Armed Forces by other than a dishonorable discharge may elect to purchase membership service credit for the period of active duty service in the Armed Forces.\n\n5. Any member granted unpaid maternity or paternity leave for a period, from a position covered by the retirement system, who returned to employment in such a position, may elect to purchase membership service credit for the period of leave.\n\n6. Any member who is or was certified as a vocational-technical teacher on the basis of having a college degree or who was required to have a period of work experience of at least two years in the area of the subject being taught in order to qualify for such certification may, upon written application to the board, purchase equivalent membership service credit for such work experience which shall not exceed the two years necessary for certification if the work experience was in the area that the member taught or is teaching and was completed in two years.\n\n7. Any member who had membership service credit with the public school retirement system of Missouri governed by sections 169.010 to 169.141 but which membership service credit was forfeited by withdrawal or refund may elect to purchase credit for such service. The public school retirement system of Missouri shall transfer to this system an amount equal to the employer contributions for the forfeited service being purchased, plus interest, which shall be applied to reduce the amount the member would otherwise pay for the purchase, provided that the amount transferred shall not exceed one-half of the purchase cost.\n\n8. A member may elect to purchase membership service credit for service rendered while on leave from an employer, as defined in section 169.600, for a not-for-profit corporation or agency whose primary purpose is support of education or education research if the member was employed by that organization to serve twenty or more hours per week on a regular basis.\n\n9.

If there is no beneficiary so nominated who survives the member for the remainder of the one hundred twenty monthly payments, the reserve for the remainder of such one hundred twenty monthly payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the last person, in that order of precedence, to receive a monthly allowance in a lump sum payment. If the total of the one hundred twenty payments paid to the retired individual and the beneficiary of the retired individual is less than the total of the member's accumulated contributions, the difference shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum; or\n\nUpon the death of the member prior to the member having received sixty monthly payments of the member's reduced allowance, the remainder of the sixty monthly payments of the reduced allowance shall be paid to such beneficiary as the member shall have nominated in the member's election of the option or in a subsequent nomination. If there is no beneficiary so nominated who survives the member for the remainder of the sixty monthly payments, the reserve for the remainder of such sixty monthly payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the last person, in that order of precedence, to receive a monthly allowance in a lump sum payment. If the total of the sixty payments paid to the retired individual and the beneficiary of the retired individual is less than the total of the member's accumulated contributions, the difference shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum; or\n\nA plan of variable monthly benefit payments which provides, in conjunction with the member's retirement benefits under the federal Social Security laws, level or near-level retirement benefit payments to the member for life during retirement, and if authorized, to an appropriate beneficiary designated by the member. Such a plan shall be actuarially equivalent to the retirement allowance under option 1 and shall be available for election only if established by the board of trustees under duly adopted rules.\n\n(2) The election of an option may be made only in the application for retirement and such application must be filed prior to the date on which the retirement of the member is to be effective. If either the member or the person nominated dies before the effective date of retirement, the option shall not be effective, provided that:\n\n(a) If the member or a person retired on disability retirement dies after attaining age fifty-five and acquiring five or more years of creditable service or after acquiring twenty-five or more years of creditable service and before retirement, except retirement with disability benefits, and the person named by the member as the member's beneficiary has an insurable interest in the life of the deceased member, the designated beneficiary may elect to receive either survivorship payments under option 2 or a payment of the member's accumulated contributions. If survivorship benefits under option 2 are elected and the member at the time of death would have been eligible to receive an actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance, the designated beneficiary may further elect to defer the option 2 payments until the date the member would have been eligible to receive the retirement allowance provided in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n(b) If the member or a person retired on disability retirement dies before attaining age fifty-five but after acquiring five but fewer than twenty-five years of creditable service, and the person named as the beneficiary has an insurable interest in the life of the deceased member or disability retiree, the designated beneficiary may elect to receive either a payment of the person's accumulated contributions or survivorship benefits under option 2 to begin on the date the member would first have been eligible to receive an actuarial equivalent of the person's retirement allowance, or to begin on the date the member would first have been eligible to receive the retirement allowance provided in subsection 1 of this section.\n\n5. If the total of the retirement or disability allowances paid to an individual before the person's death is less than the person's accumulated contributions at the time of the person's retirement, the difference shall be paid to the person's beneficiary or, if there is no beneficiary, to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or person's estate, in that order of precedence; provided, however, that if an optional benefit, as provided in option 2, 3 or 4 in subsection 4 of this section, had been elected and the beneficiary dies after receiving the optional benefit, then, if the total retirement allowances paid to the retired individual and the individual's beneficiary are less than the total of the contributions, the difference shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the beneficiary, in that order of precedence, unless the retired individual designates a different recipient with the board at or after retirement.\n\n6. If a member dies and his or her financial institution is unable to accept the final payment or payments due to the member, the final payment or payments shall be paid to the beneficiary of the member or, if there is no beneficiary, to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the member, in that order of precedence, unless otherwise stated. If the beneficiary of a deceased member dies and his or her financial institution is unable to accept the final payment or payments, the final payment or payments shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the member, in that order of precedence, unless otherwise stated.\n\n7. If a member dies before receiving a retirement allowance, the member's accumulated contributions at the time of the member's death shall be paid to the member's beneficiary or, if there is no beneficiary, to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or to the member's estate; provided, however, that no such payment shall be made if the beneficiary elects option 2 in subsection 4 of this section, unless the beneficiary dies before having received benefits pursuant to that subsection equal to the accumulated contributions of the member, in which case the amount of accumulated contributions in excess of the total benefits paid pursuant to that subsection shall be paid to the surviving spouse, surviving children in equal shares, surviving parents in equal shares, or estate of the beneficiary, in that order of precedence.\n\n8. If a member ceases to be an employee as defined in section 169.600 and certifies to the board of trustees that such cessation is permanent or if the person's membership is otherwise terminated, the person shall be paid the person's accumulated contributions with interest.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 169.600 to 169.715 to the contrary, if a member ceases to be an employee as defined in section 169.600 after acquiring five or more years of creditable service, the member may, at the option of the member, leave the member's contributions with the retirement system and claim a retirement allowance any time after the member reaches the minimum age for voluntary retirement. When the member's claim is presented to the board, the member shall be granted an allowance as provided in sections 169.600 to 169.715 on the basis of the member's age and years of service.\n\n10. The retirement allowance of a member retired because of disability shall be nine-tenths of the allowance to which the member's creditable service would entitle the member if the member's age were sixty.\n\n11. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 169.600 to 169.715 to the contrary, any member who is a member prior to October 13, 1969, may elect to have the member's retirement allowance computed in accordance with sections 169.600 to 169.715 as they existed prior to October 13, 1969.\n\n12. Any application for retirement shall include a sworn statement by the member certifying that the spouse of the member at the time the application was completed was aware of the application and the plan of retirement elected in the application.\n\n13. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person retired prior to August 14, 1984, who is receiving a reduced retirement allowance under option 1 or 2 of subsection 4 of this section, as the option existed prior to August 14, 1984, and whose beneficiary nominated to receive continued retirement allowance payments under the elected option dies or has died, shall upon application to the board of trustees have the person's retirement allowance increased to the amount the person would have been receiving had the person not elected the option actuarially adjusted to recognize any excessive benefits which would have been paid to the person up to the time of the application.\n\n14. Benefits paid pursuant to the provisions of the public education employee retirement system of Missouri shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415 of Title 26 of the United States Code, except as provided under this subsection. Notwithstanding any other law, the board of trustees may establish a benefit plan under Section 415(m) of Title 26 of the United States Code. Such plan shall be credited solely for the purpose described in Section 415(m)(3)(A) of Title 26 of the United States Code. The board of trustees may promulgate regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection and to create and administer such benefit plan.\n\n15. Any member who has retired prior to July 1, 1999, and the designated beneficiary of a deceased retired member upon request shall be made, constituted, appointed and employed by the board as a special consultant on the matters of education, retirement and aging. As compensation for such duties the person shall receive a payment equivalent to seven and four-tenths percent of the previous month's benefit, which shall be added to the member's or beneficiary's monthly annuity and which shall not be subject to the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of this section for the purposes of the limit on the total amount of increases which may be received.\n\n16.
