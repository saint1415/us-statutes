As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Capital improvement projects\", expenditures for lands or existing buildings, improvements of grounds, construction of buildings, additions to buildings, remodeling of buildings and initial equipment purchases;\n\n(2)\"School facility\", a structure dedicated primarily to housing teachers and students in the instructional process, but shall not include buildings dedicated primarily to administrative and support functions within the school.\n\n2. There is hereby created a revolving fund to be known as the \"School Building Revolving Fund\". All forfeitures of assets transferred pursuant to section 166.131, all gifts and bequests to such fund, and such moneys as may be appropriated to the fund shall be deposited into the school building revolving fund; except that no more than four hundred forty million dollars, in the aggregate, shall be transferred to the fund. After a fund balance has been established by prior years' deposits and interest, school districts may submit applications for lease purchases from the revolving fund for specific projects consistent with rules and regulations of the state board of education and subsection 3 of this section, except that no school district may be permitted to enter into a lease purchase from the school building revolving fund without first submitting a long-range capital improvements plan.\n\n3.

Ranking of the applications for offering of lease purchases shall be done in the following order:\n\n(1) Districts with capital replacement costs in excess of insurance proceeds due to facility destruction caused by fire or natural disaster shall be ranked on the basis of percentage of bonding capacity;\n\n(2) Districts with a cumulative percentage growth in fall membership for the third through the fifth preceding years in excess of twelve percent and which have a bonded indebtedness which is no less than ninety percent of the constitutional limitation on indebtedness pursuant to Section 26(b) of Article VI of the Constitution of Missouri; and\n\n(3) Districts with an equalized assessed valuation per pupil which is less than the statewide average equalized assessed valuation per pupil and which have a bonded indebtedness which is no less than ninety percent of the constitutional limitation on indebtedness pursuant to Section 26(b) of Article VI of the Constitution of Missouri.\n\n5. When building replacement is caused by fire or natural disaster, the requirement for a school district to have a long-range capital improvements plan may be waived by the state board of education.\n\n6. Each school district participating in a lease purchase from the school building revolving fund shall repay such lease purchase in no more than ten annual payments made on or before June thirtieth of each year. The first such payment shall be due and payable on June thirtieth of the first full fiscal year following receipt of lease purchase proceeds. Lease purchase repayments shall be immediately deposited to the school building revolving fund by the department. Interest charged to the school district shall not exceed three percent.\n\n7. Any school district which fails to obligate the full amount of a loan from the school building revolving fund for the allowable lease purchase must return the unobligated amount plus interest earned to the department no later than June thirtieth of the second full fiscal year after receipt of loan proceeds.\n\n8. If a school district fails to make an annual payment to the school building revolving fund after notice of nonpayment by the department, members of the board of education and the school district's superintendent shall have violated section 162.091 and the attorney general of the state of Missouri shall be notified by the state board of education to begin prosecution procedures.\n\n9.

No more than one board member may have a direct interest in such institution, entity, or clearinghouse. Such institution, entity, or clearinghouse shall implement the board's policies and administer the program for the board and with electing depository institutions and others;\n\n(5) Enter into participation agreements with participants;\n\n(6) Accept any grants, gifts, legislative appropriations, and other moneys from the state, any unit of federal, state, or local government or any other person, firm, partnership, or corporation for deposit to the account of the deposit program;\n\n(7) Invest the funds received from participants in appropriate investment instruments to be held by depository institutions or directly deposit such funds in depository institutions as provided by the board and elected by the participants;\n\n(8) Make appropriate payments and distributions on behalf of beneficiaries pursuant to participation agreements;\n\n(9) Make refunds to participants upon the termination of participation agreements pursuant to the provisions, limitations, and restrictions set forth in sections 166.500 to 166.529 and the rules adopted by the board;\n\n(10) Make provision for the payment of costs of administration and operation of the deposit program;\n\n(11) Effectuate and carry out all the powers granted by sections 166.500 to 166.529, and have all other powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes, objectives, and provisions of sections 166.500 to 166.529 pertaining to the deposit program;\n\n(12) Procure insurance, guarantees, or other protections against any loss in connection with the assets or activities of the deposit program, as the members in their best judgment deem necessary;\n\n(13) To both adopt and implement various methods of transferring money by electronic means to efficiently transfer funds to depository institutions for deposit, and in addition or in the alternative, to allow funds to be transferred by agent agreements, assignment, or otherwise, provided such transfer occurs within two business days;\n\n(14) To both adopt and implement methods and policies designed to obtain the maximum insurance of such funds for each participant permitted and provided for by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other federal agency insuring deposits, and taking into consideration the law and regulation promulgated by such federal agencies for deposit insurance.\n\n3. The funds shall be invested only in those investments which a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, as provided in section 105.688, as a means to hold funds until they are placed in a Missouri depository institution as a deposit. The board may delegate to duly appointed representatives of financial institutions authority to act in place of the board in the investment and reinvestment of all or part of the moneys and may also delegate to such representatives the authority to act in place of the board in the holding, purchasing, selling, assigning, transferring, or disposing of any or all of the investments in which such moneys shall have been invested, as well as the proceeds of such investments and such moneys, however, such investments shall be limited to certificates of deposit and other deposits in federally insured depository institutions.

No member of the board shall be liable for any action taken or omitted with respect to the exercise of, or delegation of, these powers and authority if such member shall have discharged the duties of his or her position in good faith and with that degree of diligence, care, and skill which a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\n\n4. No board member or employee of the deposit program shall personally receive any gain or profit from any funds or transaction of the deposit program as a result of his or her membership on the board.

However, a board member who is regularly employed directly or indirectly by a financial institution may state that institution's interest and absent himself or herself from voting.\n\n5. Depository institutions originating the deposit program shall be the agent of the board and offer terms for certificates of deposit and other deposits in such program as permitted by the board, subject to a uniform interest rate disclosure as defined in federal regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, specifically Federal Reserve Regulation DD, as amended from time to time. The board shall establish various deposit opportunities based on amounts deposited and length of time held that are uniformly available to all depository institutions that elect to participate in the program, and the various categories of fixed or variable rates shall be the only interest rates available under this program. A depository institution that originates the deposit as agent for the board and participates in the program shall receive back and continue to hold the certificate of deposit or other deposit, provided such depository institution continues to comply with requirements and regulations prescribed by the board. Such deposit and certificate of deposit shall be titled in the name of the clearing entity for the benefit of the participant, and shall be insured as permitted by any agency of the federal government that insures deposits in depository institutions. Any depository institution or intermediary that fails to comply with these provisions shall forfeit its right to participate in this program; provided however, the board shall be the sole and exclusive judge of compliance except as otherwise provided by provisions in Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service enforcement of such section.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 959 § 166.515, A.L. 2018 S.B. 882)\n\n*Statutory reference to \"savings\" program removed in accordance with section 3.060 based on the name change of the program in section 166.400 by H.B. 297, 2021.",
