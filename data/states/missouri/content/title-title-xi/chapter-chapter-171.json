As used in this section, a school fraternity or sorority is any organization composed wholly or in part of public school pupils, which seeks to perpetuate itself by taking in additional members from the pupils enrolled in public high schools, junior high schools or elementary schools on the basis of the decision of its membership rather than upon the free choice of any pupil in the school who is qualified by the rules of the board to fill the aims of the organization.\n\n2. The school board of any school district, by rule, may prohibit membership of pupils in school fraternities or sororities composed of pupils in any high school, junior high school or elementary school in the district, when it deems that membership in the fraternities or sororities detrimentally affects the conduct and discipline of the schools in the district. Any rule adopted under this subsection shall prescribe the aim of school organizations which may be formed and the qualifications of pupils eligible for membership therein. The board may adopt other rules that are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n3. Upon the adoption of the rule authorized by subsection 2, the school board may suspend, discipline and expel from the schools under its control, any pupil who remains a member of, who joins or promises to join, or who becomes pledged to become a member, or who solicits any other person to join, promise to join or be pledged or to become a member of a school fraternity or sorority.
