The special administrative board shall appoint a superintendent of schools to serve as the chief executive officer of the school district, or a subset of schools, and to have all powers and duties of any other general superintendent of schools in a seven-director school district. Any special administrative board appointed under this section shall be responsible for the operation of the district or part of the district until such time that the district is classified by the state board of education as provisionally accredited for at least two successive academic years, after which time the state board of education may provide for a transition pursuant to section 162.083; or\n\n(b) Determine an alternative governing structure for the district including, at a minimum:\n\na. A rationale for the decision to use an alternative form of governance and in the absence of the district's achievement of full accreditation, the state board of education shall review and recertify the alternative form of governance every three years;\n\nb. A method for the residents of the district to provide public comment after a stated period of time or upon achievement of specified academic objectives;\n\nc. Expectations for progress on academic achievement, which shall include an anticipated time line for the district to reach full accreditation; and\n\nd. Annual reports to the general assembly and the governor on the progress towards accreditation of any district that has been declared unaccredited and is placed under an alternative form of governance, including a review of the effectiveness of the alternative governance; or\n\n(c) Attach the territory of the lapsed district to another district or districts for school purposes; or\n\n(d) Establish one or more school districts within the territory of the lapsed district, with a governance structure specified by the state board of education, with the option of permitting a district to remain intact for the purposes of assessing, collecting, and distributing property taxes, to be distributed equitably on a weighted average daily attendance basis, but to be divided for operational purposes, which shall take effect sixty days after the adjournment of the regular session of the general assembly next following the state board's decision unless a statute or concurrent resolution is enacted to nullify the state board's decision prior to such effective date.\n\n4. If a district remains under continued governance by the school board under subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section and either has been unaccredited for three consecutive school years and failed to attain accredited status after the third school year or has been unaccredited for two consecutive school years and the state board of education determines its academic progress is not consistent with attaining accredited status after the third school year, then the state board of education shall proceed under subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section in the following school year.\n\n5. A special administrative board or any other form of governance appointed under this section shall retain the authority granted to a board of education for the operation of the lapsed school district under the laws of the state in effect at the time of the lapse and may enter into contracts with accredited school districts or other education service providers in order to deliver high-quality educational programs to the residents of the district. If a student graduates while attending a school building in the district that is operated under a contract with an accredited school district as specified under this subsection, the student shall receive his or her diploma from the accredited school district. The authority of the special administrative board or any other form of governance appointed under this section shall expire at the end of the third full school year following its appointment, unless extended by the state board of education. If the lapsed district is reassigned, the governing board prior to lapse shall provide an accounting of all funds, assets and liabilities of the lapsed district and transfer such funds, assets, and liabilities of the lapsed district as determined by the state board of education. Neither the special administrative board nor any other form of governance appointed under this section nor its members or employees shall be deemed to be the state or a state agency for any purpose, including section 105.711, et seq. The state of Missouri, its agencies and employees shall be absolutely immune from liability for any and all acts or omissions relating to or in any way involving the lapsed district, a special administrative board, any other form of governance appointed under this section, or the members or employees of the lapsed district, a special administrative board, or any other form of governance appointed under this section. Such immunities, and immunity doctrines as exist or may hereafter exist benefitting boards of education, their members and their employees shall be available to the special administrative board or any other form of governance appointed under this section and the members and employees of the special administrative board or any other form of governance appointed under this section*.\n\n6. Neither the special administrative board nor any other form of governance appointed under this section nor any district or other entity assigned territory, assets or funds from a lapsed district shall be considered a successor entity for the purpose of employment contracts, unemployment compensation payment pursuant to section 288.110, or any other purpose.\n\n7. If additional teachers are needed by a district as a result of increased enrollment due to the annexation of territory of a lapsed or dissolved district, such district shall grant an employment interview to any permanent teacher of the lapsed or dissolved district upon the request of such permanent teacher.\n\n8. In the event that a school district with an enrollment in excess of five thousand pupils lapses, no school district shall have all or any part of such lapsed school district attached without the approval of the board of the receiving school district.\n\n9. If the state board of education reasonably believes that a school district is unlikely to provide for the minimum school term required by section 163.021 because of financial difficulty, the state board of education may, prior to the start of the school term:\n\n(1) Allow continued governance by the existing district school board under terms and conditions established by the state board of education; or\n\n(2) Lapse the corporate organization of the district and implement one of the options available under subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section.\n\n10.

This subsection shall apply to each full school year beginning on or after July 1, 1991. In the event that federal funding fails to be appropriated at the authorized level as described in 20 U.S.C. Section*1419(b)(2), the implementation of this subsection relating to services for children with disabilities three and four years of age may be delayed until such time as funds are appropriated to meet such level. Each local school district and each special school district shall be responsible to engage in a planning process to design the service delivery system necessary to provide special education and related services for children three and four years of age with disabilities.

Transfer corporation, board, powers and duties, funding — termination of corporation, funds to lapse to general revenue — regional attendance zones. —1. There is hereby established a \"Metropolitan Schools Achieving Value in Transfer Corporation\", which shall be a public body corporate, for the purpose of implementing an urban voluntary school transfer program within a program area which shall include a city not within a county and any school district located in whole or in part in a county with a population in excess of nine hundred thousand persons which district chooses to participate. The corporation shall be governed by a board of directors consisting of one representative from each school district that participates in the urban voluntary school transfer program selected by the governing body of each such district. The vote of each member of the board shall be weighted proportionately to the percentage of the total of transfer students who attend school in the member's district.\n\n2. (1) The corporation's board of directors shall design and operate an urban voluntary school transfer program for all participating districts. The board shall make provision for transportation of all the students and for payment to school districts for the education of such students. Acceptance of students into the program shall be determined by policies enacted by the corporation's board of directors, provided that first preference for acceptance of students shall be granted to students currently attending a district other than the district of residence pursuant to a voluntary transfer program established pursuant to federal desegregation order, decree or agreement. All provisions of this section shall be subject to a settlement incorporated into a final judgment, provided that the financial provisions of this section shall not be superseded by such settlement.\n\n(2) Each district, other than a metropolitan school district, participating in an urban voluntary school transfer program shall place before voters in the district a proposal to continue participation in the urban voluntary school transfer program at the April election during the sixth year of operation of the program. Unless a majority of district voters voting thereon votes to continue participation in the program, each district, other than a metropolitan school district, shall file a plan, no later than the end of the seventh year of the operation of the program, for phase-out of the district's participation in the program, and such plan shall be provided to the state board of education, the transitional school district and the board of directors of the corporation. Each such plan shall provide for elimination of transfers to the district pursuant to this section no later than the following schedule:\n\n(a) The ninth year of the program for grades one through three;\n\n(b) The tenth year of the program for grades four through six;\n\n(c) The eleventh year of the program for grades seven through nine; and\n\n(d) The twelfth year of the program for grades ten through twelve.\n\n3. (1) Other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, each student participating in the program shall be considered an eligible pupil of the district of residence for the purpose of distributing state aid, except that students attending school in a metropolitan school district in a program established pursuant to this section shall be considered eligible pupils of the district attended, and provided that the department shall determine the increased state aid eligibility created by including pupils attending school in a program established pursuant to this section as eligible pupils of the district of residence and shall distribute the full amount of such state aid to the metropolitan schools achieving value in transfer corporation and shall not distribute state aid on the basis of such pupils to the district of residence.\n\n(2) For each student participating in the program, the corporation shall receive the total of all state and federal aid that would otherwise be paid to the student's district of residence, including, but not limited to, state aid provided pursuant to section 148.360, section 149.015, and sections 163.031 and 163.087. The corporation shall pay a school district that receives a nonresident student from the funds of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of this section and agreements between the corporation and the participating school districts.\n\n4. (1) In each of the first two fiscal years, the corporation shall also receive a payment of twenty-five million dollars.\n\n(2) For the third year of operation and thereafter, the corporation shall receive transportation state aid, for each student that participates in the program, which shall be in the same amount and on the same basis as would be received by the student's district of residence if the student were attending a school in the attendance zone in the student's district of residence, provided that such reimbursement shall not exceed one hundred fifty-five percent of the statewide average per pupil cost for transportation for the second preceding school year.\n\n(3) Funds received by the corporation pursuant to this subsection may be used for any purpose and need not be expended in the year received.\n\n5. The corporation created herein shall have all powers of a public body corporate, except that it shall have no paid employees. The corporation, by contract with any public entity, school district, or private entity, may retain the services of a fiscal agent, make provisions for accounting, transportation management, or other assistance that the corporation may need to carry out its functions, except that no contractor or employee of any contractor acting in a policy-making function shall have ever have been a contractor or employee of the voluntary interdistrict coordinating council or any other program established by the federal district court; except that this restriction shall not apply to transportation contractors or their employees. When a school district located in whole or in part in a county with a population in excess of nine hundred thousand persons ceases to participate in the urban public school transfer program, its representative shall be removed from the corporation's board of directors. When none of the students who reside in a school district in a city not within a county opt to participate in the program, the school district's representative shall be removed from the board of directors. When all of the school districts have ended their participation in the program, in accordance with this subsection, the corporation's operations shall cease, and any funds of the corporation remaining shall be paid to the state of Missouri to the credit of the general revenue fund, except such amounts as the commissioner of education shall determine should be paid to particular school districts under the regulations applicable to federal programs or returned to the federal government.\n\n6. All funds received by the corporation shall become funds of the corporation and paid for the purposes set forth in this section and in accordance with agreements entered into between the corporation and participating school districts and other entities, provided that funds received for particular purposes, under federal or state categorical programs benefitting individual students, shall be paid to the district or entity providing services to the students entitled to such services. The proportionate share of federal and state resources generated by students with disabilities, or the staff serving them, shall be paid to the district where the child is attending school, unless the district of residence is required by law to provide such services to the individual students, except that a special school district containing the district where the child is attending school shall be paid for all unreimbursed expenses for special education services provided to students with disabilities. Funds held by the corporation at the close of a fiscal year may be carried over and utilized by the corporation in subsequent fiscal years for the purposes set forth in this section.\n\n7. The board of directors may establish regional attendance zones which map the regions of a district in a city not within a county to corresponding recipient districts within the remainder of the program area. In establishing the regional attendance zones, the board of directors may solicit comments and suggestions from residents of the program area and may adopt one or more regional attendance zones previously established in the program area pursuant to a federal court desegregation order, decree or agreement.\n\n(L. 1998 S.B. 781, A.L. 2011 H.B. 464)",
