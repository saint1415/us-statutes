The county election official shall give legal notice at least sixty days prior to such general or primary election or special election in at least two newspapers that such proposition or propositions shall be submitted at the next general or primary election or special election held for submission of this proposition.

The board of the district may impose a museum and cultural district sales tax by resolution on all retail sales made in such museum and cultural district which are subject to taxation pursuant to the provisions of sections 144.010 to 144.525. Such museum and cultural district sales tax may be imposed for any museum or cultural purpose designated by the board of the museum and cultural district. If the resolution is adopted the board of the district may submit the question of whether to impose a sales tax authorized by this section to the qualified voters, who shall have the same voting interests as with the election of members of the board of the district.\n\n2. The sales tax authorized by this section shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter following adoption of the tax by the board or qualified voters, if the board elects to submit the question of whether to impose a sales tax to the qualified voters.\n\n3. In each museum and cultural district in which a sales tax has been imposed in the manner provided by this section, every retailer shall add the tax imposed by the museum and cultural district pursuant to this section to the retailer's sale price, and when so added such tax shall constitute a part of the price, shall be a debt of the purchaser to the retailer until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price.\n\n4. In order to permit sellers required to collect and report the sales tax authorized by this section to collect the amount required to be reported and remitted, but not to change the requirements of reporting or remitting tax or to serve as a levy of the tax, and in order to avoid fractions of pennies, the museum and cultural district may establish appropriate brackets which shall be used in the district imposing a tax pursuant to this section in lieu of those brackets provided in section 144.285.\n\n5. All revenue received by a museum and cultural district from the tax authorized by this section which has been designated for a certain museum or cultural purpose shall be deposited in a special trust fund and shall be used solely for such designated purpose. All funds remaining in the special trust fund shall continue to be used solely for such designated museum or cultural purpose. Any funds in such special trust fund which are not needed for current expenditures may be invested by the board of directors in accordance with applicable laws relating to the investment of other museum or cultural district funds.\n\n6. The sales tax may be imposed at a rate of one-half of one percent, three-fourths of one percent or one percent on the receipts from the sale at retail of all tangible personal property or taxable services at retail within the museum and cultural district adopting such tax, if such property and services are subject to taxation by the state of Missouri pursuant to the provisions of sections 144.010 to 144.525. Any museum and cultural district sales tax imposed pursuant to this section shall be imposed at a rate that shall be uniform throughout the district.\n\n7. On and after the effective date of any tax imposed pursuant to this section, the museum and cultural district shall perform all functions incident to the administration, collection, enforcement, and operation of the tax. The tax imposed pursuant to this section shall be collected and reported upon such forms and under such administrative rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the museum and cultural district.\n\n8. All applicable provisions contained in sections 144.010 to 144.525 governing the state sales tax, sections 32.085 and 32.087, and section 32.057, the uniform confidentiality provision, shall apply to the collection of the tax imposed by this section, except as modified in this section. All revenue collected under this section by the director of the department of revenue on behalf of the museum and cultural districts, except for one percent for the cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund, shall be deposited in a special trust fund, which is hereby created and shall be known as the \"Missouri Museum Cultural District Tax Fund\", and shall be used solely for such designated purpose. Moneys in the fund shall not be deemed to be state funds, and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director may make refunds from the amounts in the fund and credited to the district for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such county.\n\n9. All exemptions granted to agencies of government, organizations, persons and to the sale of certain articles and items of tangible personal property and taxable services pursuant to the provisions of sections 144.010 to 144.525 are hereby made applicable to the imposition and collection of the tax imposed by this section.\n\n10. The same sales tax permit, exemption certificate and retail certificate required by sections 144.010 to 144.525 for the administration and collection of the state sales tax shall satisfy the requirements of this section, and no additional permit or exemption certificate or retail certificate shall be required; except that the museum and cultural district may prescribe a form of exemption certificate for an exemption from the tax imposed by this section.\n\n11. The penalties provided in section 32.057 and sections 144.010 to 144.525 for violation of those sections are hereby made applicable to violations of this section.\n\n12. For the purpose of a sales tax imposed by a resolution pursuant to this section, all retail sales except retail sales of motor vehicles shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or the retailer's agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. In the event a retailer has more than one place of business in this state which participates in the sale, the sale shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer where the initial order for the tangible personal property is taken, even though the order shall be forwarded elsewhere for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment or billing. A sale by a retailer's employee shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business from which the employee works.\n\n13. All sales taxes collected by the museum and cultural district shall be deposited by the museum and cultural district in a special fund to be expended for the purposes authorized in this section. The museum and cultural district shall keep accurate records of the amount of money which was collected pursuant to this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection by the officers and directors of each museum and cultural district and the Missouri department of revenue. Tax returns filed by businesses within the district shall otherwise be considered as confidential in the same manner as sales tax returns filed with the Missouri department of revenue.\n\n14. No museum and cultural district imposing a sales tax pursuant to this section may repeal or amend such sales tax unless such repeal or amendment will not impair the district's ability to repay any liabilities which it has incurred, money which it has borrowed or revenue bonds, notes or other obligations which it has issued or which have been issued to finance any project or projects.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 21, A.L. 2013 S.B. 23)",
