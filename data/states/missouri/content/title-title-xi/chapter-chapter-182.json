County commission may establish library district without vote, when — tax levy, submitted how — dissolution of library district — change of boundaries, procedure. —1. In addition to the provisions of section 182.010, the county commission of any county of the state may establish by its order a county library district without a petition or submission to the voters as provided in section 182.010, provided such district conforms otherwise to the provisions of that section and does not include any part of a regional library system established pursuant to other provisions of this chapter. In the event a district is so established, the county commission shall propose an annual rate of taxation within the limitations prescribed by section 182.010, which proposal shall be submitted to a vote of the people in the same manner as though the district were formed under the provisions of that section.\n\n2. Where the county library district of any county is not operating a library within such county, the county commission may divide the county library district into subdistricts. In the event the subdistricts are established, the county commission shall propose an annual rate of taxation, which proposal shall be submitted to a vote of the people residing in the subdistrict in the same manner as provided for in section 182.010. If a majority of the votes cast on the question are for the tax as submitted, the tax shall be levied and collected on property within the subdistrict in the same manner as other county library taxes are levied and collected pursuant to section 182.020.

The committee may, by majority vote of the members, suspend the order of rulemaking or portion thereof by action taken prior to the filing of the final order of rulemaking only for one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(1) An absence of statutory authority for the proposed rule;\n\n(2) An emergency relating to public health, safety or welfare;\n\n(3) The proposed rule is in conflict with state law;\n\n(4) A substantial change in circumstance since enactment of the law upon which the proposed rule is based.\n\n8.
