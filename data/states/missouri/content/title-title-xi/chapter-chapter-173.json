      "text": "Title XI EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES\n\nChapter 173\n\n173.005. Department of higher education created — agencies, divisions, transferred to department — coordinating board, appointment qualifications, terms, compensation, duties, advisory committee, members. —1. There is hereby created a \"Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development\", and the division of higher education of the department of education is abolished and all its powers, duties, functions, personnel and property are transferred as provided by the Reorganization Act of 1974, Appendix B, RSMo.\n\n2. The commission on higher education is abolished and all its powers, duties, personnel and property are transferred by type I transfer to the \"Coordinating Board for Higher Education\", which is hereby created, and the coordinating board shall be the head of the department. The coordinating board shall consist of nine members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate, and not more than five of its members shall be of the same political party. None of the members shall be engaged professionally as an educator or educational administrator with a public or private institution of higher education at the time appointed or during his term. Moreover, no person shall be appointed to the coordinating board who shall not be a citizen of the United States, and who shall not have been a resident of the state of Missouri two years next prior to appointment, and at least one but not more than two persons shall be appointed to said board from each congressional district. The term of service of a member of the coordinating board shall be six years and said members, while attending the meetings of the board, shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, nothing in this section relating to a change in the composition and configuration of congressional districts in this state shall prohibit a member who is serving a term on August 28, 2011, from completing his or her term. The coordinating board may, in order to carry out the duties prescribed for it in subsections 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 of this section, employ such professional, clerical and research personnel as may be necessary to assist it in performing those duties, but this staff shall not, in any fiscal year, exceed twenty-five full-time equivalent employees regardless of the source of funding. In addition to all other powers, duties and functions transferred to it, the coordinating board for higher education shall have the following duties and responsibilities:\n\n(1) The coordinating board for higher education may approve, not approve, or provisionally approve proposed new degree programs to be offered by the state institutions of higher education. The coordinating board may authorize a degree program outside an institution's coordinating board-approved mission only when the coordinating board has received clear evidence that the institution proposing to offer the program:\n\n(a) Made a good-faith effort to explore the feasibility of offering the program in collaboration with an institution the mission of which includes offering the program;\n\n(b) Is contributing substantially to the goals in the coordinating board's coordinated plan for higher education;\n\n(c) Has the existing capacity to ensure the program is delivered in a high-quality manner;\n\n(d) Has demonstrated that the proposed program is needed;\n\n(e) Has a clear plan to meet the articulated workforce need; and\n\n(f) Such other factors deemed relevant by the coordinating board;\n\n(2) The governing board of each public institution of higher education in the state shall have the power and authority to confer degrees in chiropractic, osteopathic medicine, and podiatry only in collaboration with the University of Missouri, provided that such collaborative agreements are approved by the governing board of each institution and that in these instances the University of Missouri will be the degree-granting institution. Should the University of Missouri decline to collaborate in the offering of such programs, any of these institutions may seek approval of the program through the coordinating board for higher education's comprehensive review process when doing so would not unnecessarily duplicate an existing program, collaboration is not feasible or a viable means of meeting the needs of students and employers, and the institution has the academic and financial capacity to offer the program in a high quality manner;\n\n(3) The coordinating board for higher education may promote and encourage the development of cooperative agreements between Missouri public four-year institutions of higher education which do not offer graduate degrees and Missouri public four-year institutions of higher education which do offer graduate degrees for the purpose of offering graduate degree programs on campuses of those public four-year institutions of higher education which do not otherwise offer graduate degrees. Such agreements shall identify the obligations and duties of the parties, including assignment of administrative responsibility. Any diploma awarded for graduate degrees under such a cooperative agreement shall include the names of both institutions inscribed thereon. Any cooperative agreement in place as of August 28, 2003, shall require no further approval from the coordinating board for higher education. Any costs incurred with respect to the administrative provisions of this subdivision may be paid from state funds allocated to the institution assigned the administrative authority for the program. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to invalidate the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection;\n\n(4) In consultation with the heads of the institutions of higher education affected and against a background of carefully collected data on enrollment, physical facilities, manpower needs, and institutional missions, the coordinating board for higher education shall establish guidelines for appropriation requests by those institutions of higher education; however, other provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1974 notwithstanding, all funds shall be appropriated by the general assembly to the governing board of each public four-year institution of higher education which shall prepare expenditure budgets for the institution;\n\n(5) No new state-supported senior colleges or residence centers shall be established except as provided by law and with approval of the coordinating board for higher education;\n\n(6) The coordinating board for higher education shall establish admission guidelines consistent with institutional missions;\n\n(7) The coordinating board for higher education shall require all public two-year and four-year higher education institutions to replicate best practices in remediation identified by the coordinating board and institutions from research undertaken by regional educational laboratories, higher education research organizations, and similar organizations with expertise in the subject, and identify and reduce methods that have been found to be ineffective in preparing or retaining students or that delay students from enrollment in college-level courses;\n\n(8) The coordinating board shall establish policies and procedures for institutional decisions relating to the residence status of students;\n\n(9) The coordinating board shall establish guidelines to promote and facilitate the transfer of students between institutions of higher education within the state and, with the assistance of the committee on transfer and articulation, shall require all public two-year and four-year higher education institutions to create by July 1, 2014, a statewide core transfer library of at least twenty-five lower division courses across all institutions that are transferable among all public higher education institutions. The coordinating board shall establish policies and procedures to ensure such courses are accepted in transfer among public institutions and treated as equivalent to similar courses at the receiving institutions. The coordinating board shall develop a policy to foster reverse transfer for any student who has accumulated enough hours in combination with at least one public higher education institution in Missouri that offers an associate degree and one public four-year higher education institution in the prescribed courses sufficient to meet the public higher education institution's requirements to be awarded an associate degree. The department of elementary and secondary education shall maintain the alignment of the assessments found in section 160.518 and successor assessments with the competencies previously established under this subdivision for entry-level collegiate courses in English, mathematics, foreign language, sciences, and social sciences associated with an institution's general education core;\n\n(10) The coordinating board shall collect the necessary information and develop comparable data for all institutions of higher education in the state. The coordinating board shall use this information to delineate the areas of competence of each of these institutions and for any other purposes deemed appropriate by the coordinating board;\n\n(11) Compliance with requests from the coordinating board for institutional information and the other powers, duties and responsibilities, herein assigned to the coordinating board, shall be a prerequisite to the receipt of any funds which the coordinating board is responsible for administering;\n\n(12) If any institution of higher education in this state, public or private, willfully fails or refuses to follow any lawful guideline, policy or procedure established or prescribed by the coordinating board, or knowingly deviates from any such guideline, or knowingly acts without coordinating board approval where such approval is required, or willfully fails to comply with any other lawful order of the coordinating board, the coordinating board may, after a public hearing, withhold or direct to be withheld from that institution any funds the disbursement of which is subject to the control of the coordinating board, or may remove the approval of the institution as an approved institution within the meaning of section 173.1102. If any such public institution willfully disregards board policy, the commissioner of higher education may order such institution to remit a fine in an amount not to exceed one percent of the institution's current fiscal year state operating appropriation to the board. The board shall hold such funds until such time that the institution, as determined by the commissioner of higher education, corrects the violation, at which time the board shall refund such amount to the institution. If the commissioner determines that the institution has not redressed the violation within one year, the fine amount shall be deposited into the general revenue fund, unless the institution appeals such decision to the full coordinating board, which shall have the authority to make a binding and final decision, by means of a majority vote, regarding the matter. However, nothing in this section shall prevent any institution of higher education in this state from presenting additional budget requests or from explaining or further clarifying its budget requests to the governor or the general assembly;\n\n(13) In recognition of institutions that meet the requirements of subdivision (2), (3), or (4) of subsection 1 of section 173.616, are established by name as an educational institution in Missouri, and are authorized to operate programs beyond secondary education for purposes of authorization under 34 CFR 600.9, the coordinating board for higher education shall maintain and publish on its website a list of such postsecondary educational institutions; and\n\n(14) (a) As used in this subdivision, the term\"out-of-state public institution of higher education\"shall mean an education institution located outside of Missouri that:\n\na. Is controlled or administered directly by a public agency or political subdivision or is classified as a public institution by the state;\n\nb. Receives appropriations for operating expenses directly or indirectly from a state other than Missouri;\n\nc. Provides a postsecondary course of instruction at least six months in length leading to or directly creditable toward a degree or certificate;\n\nd. Meets the standards for accreditation by an accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education or any successor agency; and\n\ne. Permits faculty members to select textbooks without influence or pressure by any religious or sectarian source.\n\n(b) No later than July 1, 2008, the coordinating board shall promulgate rules regarding:\n\na. The board's approval process of proposed new degree programs and course offerings by any out-of-state public institution of higher education seeking to offer degree programs or course work within the state of Missouri; and\n\nb. The board's approval process of degree programs and courses offered by any out-of-state public institutions of higher education that, prior to July 1, 2008, were approved by the board to operate a school in compliance with the provisions of sections 173.600 to 173.618. The rules shall ensure that, as of July 1, 2008, all out-of-state public institutions seeking to offer degrees and courses within the state of Missouri are evaluated in a manner similar to Missouri public higher education institutions. Such out-of-state public institutions shall be held to standards no lower than the standards established by the coordinating board for program approval and the policy guidelines of the coordinating board for data collection, cooperation, and resolution of disputes between Missouri institutions of higher education under this section. Any such out-of-state public institutions of higher education wishing to continue operating within this state must be approved by the board under the rules promulgated under this subdivision. The coordinating board may charge and collect fees from out-of-state public institutions to cover the costs of reviewing and assuring the quality of programs offered by out-of-state public institutions. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2007, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subdivision or in section 173.616 shall be construed or interpreted so that students attending an out-of-state public institution are considered to be attending a Missouri public institution of higher education for purposes of obtaining student financial assistance.\n\n3. The coordinating board shall meet at least four times annually with an advisory committee who shall be notified in advance of such meetings. The coordinating board shall have exclusive voting privileges. The advisory committee shall consist of thirty-two members, who shall be the president or other chief administrative officer of the University of Missouri; the chancellor of each campus of the University of Missouri; the president of each state-supported four-year college or university, including Harris-Stowe State University, Missouri Southern State University, Missouri Western State University, and Lincoln University; the president of State Technical College of Missouri; the president or chancellor of each public community college district; and representatives of each of five accredited private institutions selected biennially, under the supervision of the coordinating board, by the presidents of all of the state's privately supported institutions; but always to include at least one representative from one privately supported community college, one privately supported four-year college, and one privately supported university. The conferences shall enable the committee to advise the coordinating board of the views of the institutions on matters within the purview of the coordinating board.\n\n4. The University of Missouri, Lincoln University, and all other state-governed colleges and universities, chapters 172, 174, 175, and others, are transferred by type III transfers to the department of higher education and workforce development subject to the provisions of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n5. The state historical society, chapter 183, is transferred by type III transfer to the University of Missouri.\n\n6. The state anatomical board, chapter 194, is transferred by type II transfer to the department of higher education and workforce development.\n\n7. All the powers, duties and functions vested in the division of public schools and state board of education relating to community college state aid and the supervision, formation of districts and all matters otherwise related to the state's relations with community college districts and matters pertaining to community colleges in public school districts, chapters 163, 178, and others, are transferred to the coordinating board for higher education by type I transfer. Provided, however, that all responsibility for administering the federal-state programs of vocational-technical education, except for the 1202a postsecondary educational amendments of 1972 program, shall remain with the department of elementary and secondary education. The department of elementary and secondary education and the coordinating board for higher education shall cooperate in developing the various plans for vocational-technical education; however, the ultimate responsibility will remain with the state board of education.\n\n8. All the powers, duties, functions, and properties of the state poultry experiment station, chapter 262, are transferred by type I transfer to the University of Missouri, and the state poultry association and state poultry board are abolished. In the event the University of Missouri shall cease to use the real estate of the poultry experiment station for the purposes of research or shall declare the same surplus, all real estate shall revert to the governor of the state of Missouri and shall not be disposed of without legislative approval.\n\n(L. 1973 1st.

Additional responsibilities. —The coordinating board, in addition, shall have responsibility, within the provisions of the constitution and the statutes of the state of Missouri, for:\n\n(1) Requesting the governing boards of all state-supported institutions of higher education, and of major private institutions to submit to the coordinating board any proposed policy changes which would create additional institutions of higher education, additional residence centers, or major additions in degree and certificate programs, and make pertinent recommendations relating thereto;\n\n(2) Recommending to the governing board of any institution of higher education in the state the development, consolidation, or elimination of programs, degree offerings, physical facilities or policy changes where that action is deemed by the coordinating board as in the best interests of the institutions themselves and/or the general requirements of the state. Recommendations shall be submitted to governing boards by twelve months preceding the term in which the action may take effect;\n\n(3) Recommending to the governing boards of state-supported institutions of higher education, including public community colleges receiving state support, formulas to be employed in specifying plans for general operations, for development and expansion, and for requests for appropriations from the general assembly. Such recommendations will be submitted to the governing boards by April first of each year preceding a regular session of the general assembly of the state of Missouri;\n\n(4) Promulgating rules to include selected off-campus instruction in public college and university appropriation recommendations where prior need has been established in areas designated by the coordinating board for higher education. Funding for such off-campus instruction shall be included in the appropriation recommendations, shall be determined by the general assembly and shall continue, within the amounts appropriated therefor, unless the general assembly disapproves the action by concurrent resolution;\n\n(5) Coordinating reciprocal agreements between or among Missouri state institutions of higher education at the request of one or more of the institutions party to the agreement, and between or among Missouri state institutions of higher education and publicly supported higher education institutions located outside the state of Missouri at the request of any Missouri institution party to the agreement;\n\n(6) Entering into agreements for interstate reciprocity regarding the delivery of postsecondary distance education, administering such agreements, and approving or disapproving applications to participate in such agreements from a postsecondary institution that has its principal campus in the state of Missouri:\n\n(a) The coordinating board shall establish standards for institutional approval. Those standards shall include, but are not limited to the:\n\na. Definition of physical presence for non-Missouri institutions serving Missouri residents consistent with other states' definitions of physical presence; and\n\nb. Establishment of consumer protection policies for distance education addressing recruitment and marketing activities; disclosure of tuition, fees, and other charges; disclosure of admission processes and procedures; and student complaints;\n\n(b) The coordinating board shall establish policies for the review and resolution of student complaints arising from distance education programs offered under the agreement;\n\n(c) The coordinating board may charge fees to any institution that applies to participate in an interstate postsecondary distance education reciprocity agreement authorized pursuant to this section. Such fees shall not exceed the coordinating board for higher education's cost of reviewing and evaluating the applications; and\n\n(d) The coordinating board shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this subdivision. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2014, shall be invalid and void;\n\n(7) Administering the nurse training incentive fund;\n\n(8) Conducting, in consultation with each public four-year institution's governing board and the governing board of technical colleges and community colleges, a review every five years of the mission statements of the institutions comprising Missouri's system of public higher education. This review shall be based upon the needs of the citizens of the state as well as the requirements of business, industry, the professions and government. The purpose of this review shall be to ensure that Missouri's system of higher education is responsive to the state's needs and is focused, balanced, cost-effective, and characterized by programs of high quality as demonstrated by student performance and program outcomes. As a component of this review, each institution shall prepare, in a manner prescribed by the coordinating board, a mission implementation plan for the coordinating board's consideration and approval. If the coordinating board determines that an institution has qualified for a mission change or additional targeted resources pursuant to review conducted under this subdivision and subdivision (9) of this subsection, the coordinating board shall submit a report to the general assembly that outlines the proposed mission change or targeted state resources. No change of mission for an institution under this subdivision establishing a statewide mission shall become effective until the general assembly approves the proposed mission change by concurrent resolution, except for the institution defined pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 174.010, and has been approved by the coordinating board and the institutions for which the coordinating board has recommended a statewide mission prior to August 28, 1995. The effective date of any mission change under this subdivision shall be the first day of July immediately following the approval of the concurrent resolution by the general assembly as required under this subdivision, and shall be August 28, 1995, for any institution for which the coordinating board has recommended a statewide mission which has not yet been implemented on such date. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude an institution from initiating a request to the coordinating board for a revision of its mission; and\n\n(9) Reviewing applications from institutions seeking a statewide mission. Such institutions shall provide evidence to the coordinating board that they have the capacity to discharge successfully such a mission. Such evidence shall consist of the following:\n\n(a) That the institution enrolls a representative cross-section of Missouri students. Examples of evidence for meeting this requirement which the institution may present include, but are not limited to, the following: enrolling at least forty percent of its Missouri resident, first-time degree-seeking freshmen from outside its historic statutory service region; enrolling its Missouri undergraduate students from at least eighty percent of all Missouri counties; or enrolling one or more groups of special population students such as minorities, economically disadvantaged, or physically disadvantaged from outside its historic statutory service region at rates exceeding state averages of such populations enrolled in the higher educational institutions of this state;\n\n(b) That the institution offers one or more programs of unusual strength which respond to a specific statewide need. Examples of evidence of meeting this requirement which the institution may present include, but are not limited to, the following: receipt of national, discipline-specific accreditation when available; receipt of independent certification for meeting national or state standards or requirements when discipline-specific accreditation is not available; for occupationally specific programs, placement rates significantly higher than average; for programs for which state or national licensure is required or for which state or national licensure or registration is available on a voluntary basis, licensure or registration rates for graduates seeking such recognition significantly higher than average; or quality of program faculty as measured by the percentage holding terminal degrees, the percentage writing publications in professional journals or other appropriate media, and the percentage securing competitively awarded research grants which are higher than average;\n\n(c) That the institution has a clearly articulated admission standard consistent with the provisions of subdivision (6)*of subsection 2 of section 173.005 or section 174.130;\n\n(d) That the institution is characterized by a focused academic environment which identifies specific but limited areas of academic emphasis at the undergraduate, and if appropriate, at the graduate and professional school levels, including the identification of programs to be continued, reduced, terminated or targeted for excellence. The institution shall, consistent with its focused academic environment, also have the demonstrable capacity to provide significant public service or research support that address statewide needs for constituencies beyond its historic statutory service region; and\n\n(e) That the institution has adopted and maintains a program of continuous quality improvement, or the equivalent of such a program, and reports annually appropriate and verifiable measures of institutional accountability related to such program. Such measures shall include, but not be limited to, indicators of student achievement and institutional mission attainment such as percentage of students meeting institutional admission standards; success of remediation programs, if offered; student retention rate; student graduation rate; objective measures of student, alumni, and employer satisfaction; objective measures of student learning in general education and the major, including written and oral communication skills and critical thinking skills; percentage of students attending graduate or professional schools; student placement, licensure and professional registration rates when appropriate to a program's objectives; objective measures of successful attainment of statewide goals as may be expressed from time to time by the coordinating board or by the general assembly; and objective measures of faculty teaching effectiveness. In the development and evaluation of these institutional accountability reports, the coordinating board and institutions are expected to use multiple measures of success, including nationally developed and verified as well as locally developed and independently verified assessment instruments; however, preference shall be given to nationally developed instruments when they are available and if they are appropriate. Institutions which serve or seek to serve a statewide mission shall be judged to have met the prerequisites for such a mission when they demonstrate to the coordinating board that they have met the criteria described in this subdivision. As a component of this process, each institution shall prepare, in a manner prescribed by the coordinating board, a mission implementation plan for the coordinating board's consideration and approval.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 350 § 3, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1456, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1429, A.L. 1995 S.B. 340, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1389)\n\n*Statutory reference to subdivision \"(4)\" changed to \"(6)\" in accordance with section 3.060 based on renumbering within section 173.005 by H.

After the department has paid a loss on a defaulted loan and has entered a statement of claim in which it determines and sets forth the existence, nature and amount of the money due it by the defaulting borrower and a proposed payment schedule, the department may issue an order directing any employer of the borrower to withhold or pay over to the department money due or to become due to the department.\n\n2. Before issuing the order as provided in subsection 1 of this section, the department shall serve on the borrower the statement of claim and shall inform the borrower that the department intends to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from earnings. The department shall also provide a copy of this section or an explanation of the borrower's rights under this section.\n\n3. The department shall provide the borrower with an opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the defaulted loans.\n\n4. The department shall provide the borrower with the opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the department under terms agreeable to the department to establish a schedule for the repayment of the debt.\n\n5. The department shall provide the borrower with the opportunity to have a hearing before an impartial hearing officer appointed by the department but who is not under the control or supervision of the board or department. The procedures for the hearing shall be the same as those for contested cases under chapter 536. Upon the borrower's filing of a request for a hearing in compliance with the rules of the board, the department shall stay the commencement of collection proceedings for the debt described in the statement of claim until the department issues an order provided for in subsection 6, 7, or 8, of this section.\n\n6. At the earliest practicable date but not later than sixty days after the filing of the request for the hearing, the hearing officer shall file with the department his written decision which states specifically his findings in regard to those matters set forth in the department's statement of claim. The hearing officer shall also determine and include in his decision the terms of the repayment schedule which shall be the same as that set forth by the department in its statement of claim unless he finds no good cause to enter that schedule. Upon receipt of the hearing officer's decision, the department shall issue an order to pay debt which adopts the findings in the decision as to the existence, nature and amount of the debt and as to the repayment schedule.\n\n7. When a borrower properly requests a hearing under the board's rules and when the hearing officer does not issue a decision within sixty days of the department's having received the request for the hearing, the department shall issue an order withdrawing the statement of claim and serve it upon the borrower with a copy of this subsection. After such an order is entered, the department shall not use the provisions of this section in regard to the loans set forth in the statement of claim, but may use any other remedy provided by law to recover the moneys owed the department. The order issued by the department shall not have the effect of precluding any other administrative or judicial tribunal from deciding any claim brought by the department or other party against the borrower or from deciding any factual or legal issue relevant to such claim.\n\n8. When a borrower does not make a proper timely request for a hearing, the department may issue and serve on the borrower an order to pay debt which contains as its provisions the content of the statement of claim including the proposed repayment schedule.\n\n9. The borrower may seek judicial review of any order to pay debt under sections 536.100 to 536.140.\n\n10. Upon issuing an order to pay debt, but not less than thirty days after the statement of claim was served on the borrower, the department may issue an order to withhold earnings which directs any employer of the borrower to withhold and pay over to the department money due or to become due the borrower. The employer shall withhold from the earnings the amount specified in the order, except that the total amount withheld shall not exceed ten percent of the borrower's earnings after deduction from those earnings of any amount required by law to be withheld. When the borrower voluntarily makes a written request that money due or to become due him be withheld or applied to the debt or that more than the ten percent maximum be withheld from his earnings, the employer shall comply with that request as if so ordered by the department.\n\n11. Subject to the provisions of section 454.505, an order to withhold earnings shall have the same force and effect in regard to the employer as any other garnishment.\n\n12. No employer or other payor who complies with an order to withhold earnings shall be liable to the borrower, or to any other person claiming rights derived from the borrower, for wrongful withholding. An employer who fails or refuses to withhold or pay the amounts as ordered under this section shall be liable to the department in an amount equal to the amount which became due the department during the relevant period and which, under the order, should have been withheld and paid over.\n\n13. An employer shall not discharge, refuse to hire or otherwise discipline an employee as a result of an order to withhold and pay over certain money authorized by this section. Any employer who does so is guilty of an infraction.\n\n14. Service on the borrower or on the employer pursuant to this section or pursuant to rules promulgated under this section may be made on the borrower or employer, respectively or on other party in the manner provided for service of process in a civil action by a duly authorized process server appointed by the department, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the borrower's last known address or to the employer's address. The department may appoint any disinterested party, including, but not necessarily limited to, employees of the department, to serve such process. For purposes of this section, a borrower or an employer who does not accept receipt of service by certified mail or a borrower who has not provided the department his new or correct address is deemed to have been served as of the date on which the certified mail is mailed.\n\n15. The board may promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, rules pertaining to proceedings before the hearing officer and before the department and rules pertaining to procedures to be followed by employers to comply with the order to withhold and pay over earnings.\n\n(L. 1988 H.B. 1456)",

      "text": "Title XI EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES\n\nChapter 173\n\n173.300. Compact adopted. —The Compact for Education is hereby entered into and enacted into law with all jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nPurpose and Policy\n\nA. It is the purpose of this compact to:\n\n1. Establish and maintain close cooperation and understanding among the executive, legislative, professional, educational and lay leadership on a nationwide basis at the state and local levels.\n\n2. Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.\n\n3. Provide a clearing house of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.\n\n4. Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods and facilities.\n\nB. It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.\n\nC. The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.\n\nState Defined\n\nAs used in this compact, \"state\" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nArticle III\n\nThe Commission\n\nA. The Education Commission of the States, hereinafter called \"the commission\", is hereby established. The commission shall consist of seven members representing each party state. One of such members shall be the governor; two shall be members of the state legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine; and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, six members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and non-public educational leadership. Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed ten non-voting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.\n\nB. The members of the commission shall be entitled to one vote each on the commission. No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof. Action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III(J).\n\nC. The commission shall have a seal.\n\nD. The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, who shall be a governor, a vice chairman and a treasurer. The commission shall provide for the appointment of an executive director. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine. The executive director shall be secretary.\n\nE. Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.\n\nF. The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any party jurisdiction, the United States, or any subdivision or agency of the aforementioned governments, or from any agency of two or more of the party jurisdictions or their subdivisions.\n\nG. The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (F) of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.\n\nH. The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.\n\nI. The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.\n\nJ. The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year. The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.\n\nIn addition to authority conferred on the commission by other provisions of the compact, the commission shall have authority to:\n\n1. Collect, correlate, analyze and interpret information and data concerning educational needs and resources.\n\n2. Encourage and foster research in all aspects of education, but with special reference to the desirable scope of instruction, organization, administration, and instructional methods and standards employed or suitable for employment in public educational systems.\n\n3. Develop proposals for adequate financing of education as a whole and at each of its many levels.\n\n4. Conduct or participate in research of the types referred to in this article in any instance where the commission finds that such research is necessary for the advancement of the purposes and policies of this compact, utilizing fully the resources of national associations, regional compact organizations for higher education, and other agencies and institutions, both public and private.\n\n5. Formulate suggested policies and plans for the improvement of public education as a whole or for any segment thereof, and make recommendations with respect thereto available to the appropriate governmental units, agencies and public officials.\n\n6. Do such other things as may be necessary or incidental to the administration of any of its authority or functions pursuant to this compact.\n\nCooperation With Federal Government\n\nA. If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the commission by not to exceed ten representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, and may be drawn from any one or more branches of the federal government, but no such representative shall have a vote on the commission.\n\nB. The commission may provide information and make recommendations to any executive or legislative agency or officer of the federal government concerning the common educational policies of the states, and may advise with any such agencies or officers concerning any matter of mutual interest.\n\nA. To assist in the expeditious conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall elect a steering committee of thirty-two members which, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the commission. Eight of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of governors, eight shall be legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the commission. A federal representative on the commission may serve with the steering committee, but without vote. The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the commission shall be elected as follows: sixteen for one year and sixteen for two years. The chairman, vice chairman, and treasurer of the commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices. Vacancies in the steering committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the commission at its next regularly ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term. No person shall serve more than two terms as a member of the steering committee; provided that service for a partial term of one year or less shall not be counted toward the two term limitation.\n\nB. The commission may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any advisory or technical committee may, on request of the states concerned, be established to consider any matter of special concern to two or more of the party states.\n\nC. The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide.\n\nArticle VII\n\nA. The commission shall advise the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state of its budget and estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.\n\nB. The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states. In making such apportionment, the commission shall devise and employ a formula which takes equitable account of the populations and per capita income levels of the party states.\n\nC. The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party states. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to Article III(G) of this compact, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it pursuant to Article III(G) thereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.\n\nD. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual reports of the commission.\n\nE. The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any person authorized by the commission.\n\nF. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.\n\nArticle VIII\n\nEligible Parties; Entry Into and Withdrawal\n\nA. This compact shall have as eligible parties all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In respect of any such jurisdiction not having a governor, the term\"governor\", as used in this compact, shall mean the closest equivalent official of such jurisdiction.\n\nB. Any state or other eligible jurisdiction may enter into this compact and it shall become binding thereon when it has adopted the same; provided that in order to enter into initial effect, adoption by at least ten eligible party jurisdictions shall be required.\n\nC. Adoption of the compact may be either by enactment thereof or by adherence thereto by the governor; provided that in the absence of enactment, adherence by the governor shall be sufficient to make his state a party only until December 31, 1967. During any period when a state is participating in this compact through gubernatorial action, the governor shall appoint those persons who, in addition to himself, shall serve as the members of the commission from his state, and shall provide to the commission an equitable share of the financial support of the commission from any source available to him.\n\nD. Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1967 in accordance with paragraph C of this article, any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.\n\nConstruction and Severability\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 273 § 1, A.L. 2012 S.B. 563)",
