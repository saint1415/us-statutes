The curators of the University of Missouri may establish research, development and office park projects, in order to promote cooperative relationships and to provide for shared resources between private individuals, companies and corporations, and the University of Missouri, for the advancement of the university in carrying out its educational mission and such projects are declared to be in furtherance of the purposes of the university.\n\n2. The curators may, in connection with such projects, enter into written, mutually binding leases or agreements with individuals, businesses, corporations, and professional firms participating in the project for the purpose of expanding business and professional opportunities for students, faculty and graduates of the university and of the area it serves, and for making available to the university the resources and expertise of the business and professional entities participating in the project.\n\n3. The curators may purchase necessary land and may purchase and construct or arrange for or permit the construction of any necessary facilities for such projects, may utilize the power of eminent domain, and may in any other manner acquire and accept in the name of the curators of the University of Missouri suitable land and facilities for such projects, and may enter into business arrangements, including long-term leases, for the development thereof. The curators may also acquire options upon lands to be purchased. Lands and improvements utilized as a part of such projects, so long as they remain a part of a project, shall not be subject to local zoning or local regulatory ordinances; provided that if the project is located within a city or county, the university is required to consult with the city or county, prior to board of curators' approval of the master development plan or substantial amendments thereto. The city or county plan commission may hold and complete a public hearing on such plan within forty-five days of submission to the city or county and the city or county within fifteen days thereafter may issue its advisory recommendations to the curators. The curators may in their sole discretion require that project development conform to the planning, transportation, environmental, health and safety requirements of such city or county. Interests in property included in such projects may be conveyed as needed, without passage of a concurrent resolution as provided by the provisions of section 172.020. The utilization of the real property, as provided in subsection 1 of this section, is hereby deemed to be a public purpose and in furtherance of the purposes of the university. Provided such land is owned by the university, no leasehold or other interest therein, by whomsoever held, shall be separately assessed or taxed, and such real property as a whole shall be deemed the property of the curators of the University of Missouri and be exempt from all forms of property tax.\n\n4. For the purpose of developing and operating the project, the curators may enter into cooperative agreements, including leases, in the same manner and to the same extent that political subdivisions are authorized to enter into such agreements by the provisions of section 70.220.\n\n5. Whenever the curators' acquisition of land for such a research, development and office park project will result in displacement, relocation assistance and monetary benefits identical to those provided by subchapter II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 4621 et seq., and its implementing regulations shall be afforded to each displaced occupant or entity.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the exemption of the curators of the University of Missouri from municipal regulation and the provisions of subsection 3 of this section, any entity acting pursuant to a lease or cooperative agreement with the curators may request that permits, licenses and certificates be issued by a city or county where a project is to be located in order to aid in the construction, operation and financing of such project. Such permits, licenses and certificates may be issued by the city or county after review and approval of plans submitted by an architect or engineer licensed to practice in the state of Missouri. Any entity may also request that inspections be conducted by such city or county if such activities are normally performed by the city or county in the enforcement of its building code.\n\n7. Such doctrines of sovereign and official immunity and the public duty doctrines as now exist for the issuance of permits, licenses, certificates and performance of inspections shall apply to any city, county or official or employee thereof issuing permits, licenses, and certificates or performing inspections pursuant thereto with respect to any claim brought for damages as a result of the wrongful or negligent issuance of such permit, license or certificate or the performance of inspections.\n\n8. The exemption from assessment and taxation provided by subsection 3 of this section for leaseholds in property owned by the university in a research park project shall not be available for leases entered into from and after August 28, 1996. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any provision of this section to the contrary, all leaseholds in property in such parks leased by the university to tenants for research, development, office or any other nonrecreational use prior to August 28, 1996, including leaseholds created after August 28, 1996, under options or similar rights which were granted prior to January 1, 1996, shall be exempt from assessment and taxation for the term of such lease, provided that leaseholds in property used for recreational purposes shall be subject to assessment and taxation as determined by the assessor of the local political subdivision, and all lands and improvements in such parks, by whomsoever owned.\n\n(L. 1986 S.B. 657 § 1, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1456 merged with S.B. 820, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1237)\n\n(1997) St. Charles County Board of Equalization must presume that statute is constitutional and determine the exemption issue accordingly.

(1) The purpose of this section is to grant to the curators of the University of Missouri additional powers in the use of the land acquired by the state under the provisions of the act of February 24, 1870, establishing the agricultural and mechanical college, including the right to transfer title thereto as herein provided. The act of 1870 was enacted to comply with the provisions of the act of congress of July 2, 1862, the Morrill Act, which provided that in order for a state to qualify for a land grant it must establish and maintain an agricultural and mechanical college. The general assembly of Missouri, to assure continuance of the college in compliance with the Morrill Act, provided that the land should be used for the purposes of the agricultural and mechanical college. Since the college has now been in existence for more than ninety years and has been firmly and permanently established, the purpose of the general assembly in directing the land to be used for the purposes of the agricultural and mechanical college has been fully accomplished.\n\n(2) It is further found that, due to change in character of use of adjacent areas and due to change in the needs and methods of operation of the agricultural and mechanical college, this land has become unusable for the purposes intended in 1870, and the board of curators of the University of the State of Missouri has made available and allocated to the agricultural and mechanical college, for its exclusive use, other lands now adaptable and useful for the purposes contemplated under the original act, and in acreage far exceeding the land originally conveyed pursuant to the act of 1870.\n\n(3) It is hereby found and determined by the general assembly that it is to the best interest of the agricultural and mechanical college, the university, and the public that the permissible uses of the land be enlarged.\n\n2. All lands acquired by the state of Missouri for the use of the agricultural and mechanical college pursuant to the act of the general assembly of February 24, 1870, may be used for such purposes as the board of curators of the University of Missouri determines are in the best interest of the university including the power to transfer title thereto as provided by subsection 3.\n\n3. The curators of the University of Missouri, if it determines that the intended use of the land is in the best interests of the University of Missouri, is authorized and empowered to transfer and convey title in fee simple to any portion or portions of the land to any department, agency, subdivision or instrumentality of the state of Missouri or to the United States or any department thereof for such consideration as it deems proper. The consideration need not be monetary but may be benefits to be derived by the university from the use of the land by the grantee.\n\n4.
