The local school board for each elementary school selected to be in the pilot program shall agree to implement and fully fund an elementary social and emotional health program in such school and to continue to provide such elementary social and emotional health education program for a period no shorter than three years. The local school district may employ a social and emotional health teacher to provide such program for the elementary school.\n\n(3) The department, through its employees who work in the school counseling section, and local school districts shall collaborate to establish the instructional model for each elementary social and emotional health education program. Such instructional model shall be grade-appropriate and include instruction in an organized classroom, including instruction on how to set and achieve positive goals, how to utilize coping strategies to handle stress, and shall have an increased emphasis on protective factors, such as problem-solving skills, social support and social connectedness through positive relationships and teamwork.\n\n(4) The department, through its school counseling section, shall provide for a program evaluation regarding the success and impact of the pilot program upon completion of the third year of the pilot program and shall report the results of such evaluation to the relevant house and senate committees on health and mental health, and education.\n\n2.
