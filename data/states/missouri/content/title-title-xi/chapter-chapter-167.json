Any person who knowingly submits false information to satisfy any requirement of subsection 2 of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n5. In addition to any other penalties authorized by law, a district board may file a civil action to recover, from the parent, military guardian or legal guardian of the pupil, the costs of school attendance for any pupil who was enrolled at a school in the district and whose parent, military guardian or legal guardian filed false information to satisfy any requirement of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n6.

Any school district that receives a request for such records from another school district enrolling a pupil that had previously attended a school in such district shall respond to such request within five business days of receiving the request. School districts may report or disclose education records to law enforcement and juvenile justice authorities if the disclosure concerns law enforcement's or juvenile justice authorities' ability to effectively serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records are released.

Each school district and charter school shall assess all students enrolled in kindergarten through grade three at the beginning and end of each school year for their level of reading or reading readiness on state-approved reading assessments. Additionally, all school districts and charter schools shall assess any newly enrolled student in grades one through five for their level of reading or reading readiness on a reading assessment from the state-approved list. At the beginning of the school year, each school district and charter school shall provide a reading success plan to any student who:\n\n(1) Exhibits a substantial deficiency in reading which creates a barrier to the child's progress learning to read. The identification of such deficiency may be based upon the most recent assessments or teacher observation; or\n\n(2) Has been identified as being at risk of dyslexia in the statewide dyslexia screening or has a formal diagnosis of dyslexia.\n\n­­For the purposes of this section, a substantial reading deficiency shall refer to a student who is one or more grade level or levels behind in reading or reading readiness; provided that nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prevent a school district or charter school from offering a reading success plan to any student based on an assessment completed at the start and end of the school year or teacher observation. For any student entering the school district or charter school after the start of the school year, such student shall be provided a reading success plan in the event the student has been identified as having a substantial reading deficiency based on the student's most recent assessment or otherwise being identified through teacher observation.

If the school district or charter school provides a summer reading program under this section, the district or charter school shall notify the parent or guardian of each student who exhibits a substantial deficiency in reading of the opportunity to attend the summer reading program.\n\n4. If a student has a substantial reading deficiency at the end of third grade, the student's parent or guardian and appropriate school staff shall discuss whether the student should be retained in grade level, based on a consideration of all relevant factors, including the reading deficiency, the student's progress in other subject areas, and the student's overall intellectual, physical, emotional, and social development. A decision to promote or retain a student with a substantial reading deficiency at the end of grade three shall be made only after direct personal consultation with the student's parent or guardian and after the formulation of a specific plan of action to remedy the student's reading deficiency.\n\n5.

Each school district and charter school shall ensure that intensive reading instruction through a reading development initiative shall be provided to each kindergarten through grade five student who is assessed as exhibiting a substantial deficiency in reading. In addition to the requirements otherwise provided, such instruction shall also comply with all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Be provided to all kindergarten through grade five students who exhibit a substantial deficiency in reading under this section. The assessments shall measure phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension;\n\n(2) Be provided during regular school hours;\n\n(3) Provide a reading curriculum that meets the requirements of section 170.014, and at a minimum has the following specifications:\n\n(a) Assists students assessed as exhibiting a substantial deficiency in reading to develop the skills to read at grade level;\n\n(b) Provides skill development in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension;\n\n(c) Includes a scientifically based and reliable assessment;\n\n(d) Provides initial and ongoing analysis of each student's reading progress; and\n\n(e) Provides a curriculum in core academic subjects to assist the student in maintaining or meeting proficiency levels for the appropriate grade in all academic subjects.\n\n7. School districts and charter schools shall report to the department the specific intensive reading interventions and supports implemented by the school district or charter school pursuant to this section as well as the reading assessment data collected for grades kindergarten through five. The department shall annually prescribe the components of required or requested reports.\n\n8. (1) Each school district and charter school shall address reading proficiency as part of its comprehensive school improvement plan, drawing upon information about children from assessments conducted pursuant to subsection 1 of this section and the prevalence of deficiencies identified by classroom, elementary school, and other student characteristics. As part of its comprehensive school improvement plan or contract, each school district or charter school shall review chronic early elementary absenteeism for its impact on literacy development. If more than fifteen percent of an attendance center's students are not at grade level in reading by the end of third grade, the comprehensive school improvement plan or contract shall include strategies to reduce that percentage, including school and community strategies to raise the percentage of students who are proficient in reading.\n\n(2) Each school district and charter school shall provide professional development services to enhance the skills of elementary teachers in responding to children's unique reading issues and needs and to increase the use of evidence-based strategies.\n\n(L. 1999 H.B. 889 § 9, A.L. 2001 S.B. 319, A.L. 2022 S.B. 681 & 662)\n\nEffective 1-01-23",

      "text": "Title XI EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES\n\nChapter 167\n\n167.950. Dyslexia screening guidelines — screenings required, when — definitions — rulemaking authority. —1. (1) By December 31, 2017, the department of elementary and secondary education shall develop guidelines for the appropriate screening of students for dyslexia and related disorders and the necessary classroom support for students with dyslexia and related disorders. Such guidelines shall be consistent with the findings and recommendations of the task force created under section 633.420.\n\n(2) In the 2018-19 school year and subsequent years, each public school, including each charter school, shall conduct dyslexia screenings for students in the appropriate year consistent with the guidelines developed by the department of elementary and secondary education.\n\n(3) In the 2018-19 school year and subsequent years, the school board of each district and the governing board of each charter school shall provide reasonable classroom support consistent with the guidelines developed by the department of elementary and secondary education.\n\n2. In the 2018-19 school year and subsequent years, the practicing teacher assistance programs established under section 168.400 shall offer and include two hours of in-service training provided by each local school district for all practicing teachers in such district regarding dyslexia and related disorders. Each charter school shall also offer all of its teachers two hours of training on dyslexia and related disorders. Districts and charter schools may seek assistance from the department of elementary and secondary education in developing and providing such training. Completion of such training shall count as two contact hours of professional development under section 168.021.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Dyslexia\", a disorder that is neurological in origin, characterized by difficulties with accurate and fluent word recognition and poor spelling and decoding abilities that typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language, often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction, and of which secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge. Nothing in this definition shall require a student with dyslexia to obtain an individualized education program (IEP) unless the student has otherwise met the federal conditions necessary;\n\n(2)\"Dyslexia screening\", a short test conducted by a teacher or school counselor to determine whether a student likely has dyslexia or a related disorder in which a positive result does not represent a medical diagnosis but indicates that the student could benefit from approved support;\n\n(3)\"Related disorders\", disorders similar to or related to dyslexia, such as developmental auditory imperception, dysphasia, specific developmental dyslexia, developmental dysgraphia, and developmental spelling disability;\n\n(4)\"Support\", low-cost and effective best practices, such as oral examinations and extended test-taking periods, used to support students who have dyslexia or any related disorder.\n\n4. The state board of education shall promulgate rules and regulations for each public school to screen students for dyslexia and related disorders and to provide the necessary classroom support for students with dyslexia and related disorders. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2016, shall be invalid and void.\n\n5. Nothing in this section shall require the MO HealthNet program to expand the services that it provides.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 2379 merged with S.B. 635 merged with S.B. 638)",
