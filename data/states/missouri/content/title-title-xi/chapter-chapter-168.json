All valid teaching certificates issued pursuant to law or state board policies and regulations prior to September 1, 1988, shall be exempt from the professional development requirements of this section and shall continue in effect until they expire, are revoked or suspended, as provided by law. When such certificates are required to be renewed, the state board or its designee shall grant to each holder of such a certificate the certificate most nearly equivalent to the one so held. Anyone who holds, as of August 28, 2003, a valid PC-I, PC-II, or continuous professional certificate shall, upon expiration of such person's current certificate, be issued the appropriate level of certificate based upon the classification system established pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.\n\n3. (1) Certificates of license to teach in the public schools of the state shall be based upon minimum requirements prescribed by the state board of education which shall include completion of a background check as prescribed in section 168.133. The state board shall provide for the following levels of professional certification: an initial professional certificate and a career continuous professional certificate.\n\n(2) The initial professional certificate shall be issued upon completion of requirements established by the state board of education and shall be valid based upon verification of actual teaching within a specified time period established by the state board of education. The state board shall require holders of the four-year initial professional certificate to:\n\n(a) Participate in a mentoring program approved and provided by the district for a minimum of two years;\n\n(b) Complete thirty contact hours of professional development, which may include hours spent in class in an appropriate college curriculum, or for holders of a certificate under subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section, an amount of professional development in proportion to the certificate holder's hours in the classroom, if the certificate holder is employed less than full time; and\n\n(c) Participate in a beginning teacher assistance program.\n\n(3) (a) The career continuous professional certificate shall be issued upon verification of completion of four years of teaching under the initial professional certificate and upon verification of the completion of the requirements articulated in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subdivision (2) of this subsection or paragraphs (a) to (d) of subdivision (5) of subsection 1 of this section.\n\n(b) The career continuous professional certificate shall be continuous based upon verification of actual employment in an educational position as provided for in state board guidelines and completion of fifteen contact hours of professional development per year which may include hours spent in class in an appropriate college curriculum. Should the possessor of a valid career continuous professional certificate fail, in any given year, to meet the fifteen-hour professional development requirement, the possessor may, within two years, make up the missing hours. In order to make up for missing hours, the possessor shall first complete the fifteen-hour requirement for the current year and then may count hours in excess of the current year requirement as make-up hours. Should the possessor fail to make up the missing hours within two years, the certificate shall become inactive. In order to reactivate the certificate, the possessor shall complete twenty-four contact hours of professional development which may include hours spent in the classroom in an appropriate college curriculum within the six months prior to or after reactivating the possessor's certificate. The requirements of this paragraph shall be monitored and verified by the local school district which employs the holder of the career continuous professional certificate.\n\n(c) A holder of a career continuous professional certificate shall be exempt from the professional development contact hour requirements of paragraph (b) of this subdivision if such teacher has a local professional development plan in place within such teacher's school district and meets two of the three following criteria:\n\na.

The state board shall, upon completion of a background check as prescribed in section 168.133, issue a professional certificate classification in the areas most closely aligned with an applicant's current areas of certification, commensurate with the years of teaching experience of the applicant, to any person who is hired to teach in a public school in this state and who possesses a valid teaching certificate from another state or certification under subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section, provided that the certificate holder shall annually complete the state board's requirements for such level of certification, and shall establish policies by which residents of states other than the state of Missouri may be assessed a fee for a certificate of license to teach in the public schools of Missouri. Such fee shall be in an amount sufficient to recover any or all costs associated with the issuing of a certificate of license to teach. The board shall promulgate rules to authorize the issuance of a provisional certificate of license, which shall be valid for three years and shall allow the holder to assume classroom duties pending the completion of a criminal background check under section 168.133, for any applicant who:\n\n(1) Is the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces stationed in Missouri;\n\n(2) Relocated from another state within one year of the date of application;\n\n(3) Underwent a criminal background check in order to be issued a teaching certificate of license from another state; and\n\n(4) Otherwise qualifies under this section.\n\n6. The state board may assess to holders of an initial professional certificate a fee, to be deposited into the excellence in education fund established pursuant to section 160.268, for the issuance of the career continuous professional certificate. However, such fee shall not exceed the combined costs of issuance and any criminal background check required as a condition of issuance. Applicants for the initial ABCTE certificate shall be responsible for any fees associated with the program leading to the issuance of the certificate, but nothing in this section shall prohibit a district from developing a policy that permits fee reimbursement.\n\n7. Any member of the public school retirement system of Missouri who entered covered employment with ten or more years of educational experience in another state or states and held a certificate issued by another state and subsequently worked in a school district covered by the public school retirement system of Missouri for ten or more years who later became certificated in Missouri shall have that certificate dated back to the member's original date of employment in a Missouri public school.\n\n8. Within thirty days of receiving an application from a spouse of an active duty member of the Armed Forces of the United States who has been transferred or is scheduled to be transferred to the state of Missouri, or who has been transferred or is scheduled to be transferred to an adjacent state and is or will be domiciled in the state of Missouri, or has moved to the state of Missouri on a permanent change-of-station basis and has successfully completed the background check described under subsection 5 of this section and section 168.133, the state board shall issue to such applicant a full certificate of license to teach, provided that the applicant has paid all necessary fees and has otherwise met all requirements to be issued such a certificate.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 200 § 9-2, A.L. 1973 H.B. 158, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1457 & 1501, A.L. 1988 S.B. 797, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1142, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1469, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2003 S.B. 296, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1678 merged with S.B. 1066, A.L. 2009 S.B. 291, A.L. 2011 S.B. 54, A.L. 2013 S.B. 17, A.L. 2014 S.B. 782, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1665, A.L. 2020 S.B. 656, A.L. 2022 S.B. 681 & 662, A.L. 2024 H.B. 2287 merged with S.B. 727, A.L. 2025 S.B. 68)\n\n(Source: RSMo 1959 §§ 168.030, 168.260)",

Probationary period for teachers — removal of probationary and permanent personnel — hearing — demotions — reduction of personnel (metropolitan districts). —1. The first five years of employment of all teachers entering the employment of the metropolitan school district shall be deemed a period of probation during which period all appointments of teachers shall expire at the end of each school year. During the probationary period any probationary teacher whose work is unsatisfactory shall be furnished by the superintendent of schools with a written statement setting forth the nature of his or her incompetency. If improvement satisfactory to the superintendent is not made within one semester after the receipt of the statement, the probationary teacher shall be dismissed. The semester granted the probationary teacher in which to improve shall not in any case be a means of prolonging the probationary period beyond five years and six months from the date on which the teacher entered the employ of the board of education. The superintendent of schools on or before the fifteenth day of April in each year shall notify probationary teachers who will not be retained by the school district of the termination of their services. Any probationary teacher who is not so notified shall be deemed to have been appointed for the next school year. Any principal who prior to becoming a principal had attained permanent employee status as a teacher shall upon ceasing to be a principal have a right to resume his or her permanent teacher position with the time served as a principal being treated as if such time had been served as a teacher for the purpose of calculating seniority and pay scale. The rights and duties and remuneration of a teacher who was formerly a principal shall be the same as any other teacher with the same level of qualifications and time of service.\n\n2. After completion of satisfactory probationary services, appointments of teachers shall become permanent, subject to removal for any one or more causes herein described and to the right of the board to terminate the services of all who attain the age of compulsory retirement fixed by the retirement system. In determining the duration of the probationary period of employment in this section specified, the time of service rendered as a substitute teacher shall not be included.\n\n3. No teacher whose appointment has become permanent may be removed except for one or more of the following causes: immorality, incompetency, or inefficiency in line of duty, violation of the published regulations of the school district, violation of the laws of Missouri governing the public schools of the state, or physical or mental condition which incapacitates him for instructing or associating with children, and then only by a vote of not less than a majority of all the members of the board, upon written charges presented by the superintendent of schools, to be heard by the board after thirty days' notice, with copy of the charges served upon the person against whom they are preferred, who shall have the privilege of being present at the hearing, together with counsel, offering evidence and making defense thereto. At the request of any person so charged the hearing shall be public. During any time in which powers granted to the district's board of education are vested in a special administrative board, the special administrative board may appoint a hearing officer to conduct the hearing. Should the special administrative board relinquish power to the district's elected board of education, such board of education may also appoint a hearing officer to conduct the hearing. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing as a contested case under chapter 536 and shall issue a written recommendation to the board rendering the charges against the teacher. The board shall render a decision on the charges upon the review of the hearing officer's recommendations and the record from the hearing. The action and decision of the board upon the charges shall be final. Pending the hearing of the charges, the person charged may be suspended if the rules of the board so prescribe, but in the event the board does not by a majority vote of all the members remove the teacher upon charges presented by the superintendent, the person shall not suffer any loss of salary by reason of the suspension. Incompetency or inefficiency in line of duty is cause for dismissal only after the teacher has been notified in writing at least thirty days prior to the presentment of charges against him by the superintendent. The notification shall specify the nature of the incompetency or inefficiency with such particularity as to enable the teacher to be informed of the nature of his or her incompetency or inefficiency.\n\n4. No teacher whose appointment has become permanent shall be demoted nor shall his or her salary be reduced unless the same procedure is followed as herein stated for the removal of the teacher because of inefficiency in line of duty, and any teacher whose salary is reduced or who is demoted may waive the presentment of charges against him by the superintendent and a hearing thereon by the board. The foregoing provision shall apply only to permanent teachers prior to the compulsory retirement age under the retirement system. Nothing herein contained shall in any way restrict or limit the power of the board of education to make reductions in the number of teachers or principals, or both, because of insufficient funds, decrease in pupil enrollment, or abolition of particular subjects or courses of instruction, except that the abolition of particular subjects or courses of instruction shall not cause those teachers who have been teaching the subjects or giving the courses of instruction to be placed on leave of absence as herein provided who are qualified to teach other subjects or courses of instruction, if positions are available for the teachers in the other subjects or courses of instruction.\n\n5. Whenever it is necessary to decrease the number of teachers because of insufficient funds or a substantial decrease of pupil population within the school district, the board of education upon recommendation of the superintendent of schools may cause the necessary number of teachers beginning with those serving probationary periods to be placed on leave of absence without pay, but only in the inverse order of their appointment. Nothing herein stated shall prevent a readjustment by the board of education of existing salary schedules. No teacher placed on a leave of absence shall be precluded from securing other employment during the period of the leave of absence. Each teacher placed on leave of absence shall be reinstated in inverse order of his or her placement on leave of absence. Such reemployment shall not result in a loss of status or credit for previous years of service. No appointment of new teachers shall be made while there are available teachers on unrequested leave of absence who are properly qualified to fill such vacancies. Such leave of absence shall not impair the tenure of a teacher. The leave of absence shall continue for a period of not more than three years unless extended by the board.\n\n6. If any regulation which deals with the promotion of teachers is amended by increasing the qualifications necessary to be met before a teacher is eligible for promotion, the amendment shall fix an effective date which shall allow a reasonable length of time within which teachers may become qualified for promotion under the regulations.\n\n7. A teacher whose appointment has become permanent may give up the right to a permanent appointment to participate in the teacher choice compensation package under sections 168.745 to 168.750.\n\n8. Should the state mandate that professional development for teachers be provided in local school districts and any funds be utilized for such, a metropolitan school district shall be allowed to utilize a professional development plan for teachers which is known within the administration as the \"St. Louis Plan\", should the district and the teacher decide jointly to participate in such plan.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 200 § 9-22, A.L. 1967 p. 238, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1469 merged with S.B. 781, A.L. 2005 H.B. 297 merged with S.B. 299, A.L. 2009 S.B. 291, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1543, A.L. 2013 S.B. 125, A.L. 2019 H.B. 604)\n\n(Source: RSMo 1959 § 165.590)\n\n(1984) Statute authorizing leaves of absence for probationary teachers deals with layoffs; it does not deal with nonrenewal of contracts.

The committee may rule\n\n(a) That the employee's suspension was justified and that he is discharged with loss of pay as of the date of his suspension;\n\n(b) That the suspension was unjustified and no grounds calling for his discharge have been proven and that the employee shall immediately be restored to his former position without any loss of pay;\n\n(c) That the proven charges are of such a nature that they can be removed or remedied by transferring the employee to a different position, grade, classification, school or building in which case the employee shall lose no pay during his suspension prior to the committee's decision;\n\n(d) Or the committee may make any ruling, less severe than that of discharge, which the committee may deem meet and just under the circumstances including suspension with the loss of pay. The decision of the personnel committee shall be final; provided, however, that upon the request of the employee affected the board shall review the record of the proceedings before the personnel committee and may, in its discretion, grant the employee a hearing before the board. Upon hearing the board may affirm, rescind or modify the decision of the committee and make any other orders in connection therewith that are appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n3. No employee whose appointment has become permanent shall be suspended without pay, nor be demoted nor shall his salary be reduced unless the same procedure is followed as herein stated for the removal of the employee because of inefficiency in line of duty, and any employee whose salary is reduced or who is demoted may waive the presentment of charges against him and a hearing thereon by the committee. Nothing herein shall in any way restrict or limit the powers of the board of education to make reductions in the number of employees because of insufficient funds or decrease in pupil enrollment or lack of work.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 200 § 9-28, A.L. 2005 S.B. 287)\n\n(Source: L. 1961 p. 354 §§ 5, 6, 7)\n\nEffective 7-01-06\n\n(2000) Certified school guidance counselor has no right to a hearing pursuant to this section.
