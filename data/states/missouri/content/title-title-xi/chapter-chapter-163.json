Definitions — method of calculating state aid. —As used in this chapter unless the context requires otherwise:\n\n(1)\"Adjusted operating levy\", the sum of tax rates for the current year for teachers' and incidental funds for a school district as reported to the proper officer of each county pursuant to section 164.011;\n\n(2)\"Average daily attendance\", the quotient or the sum of the quotients obtained by dividing the total number of hours attended in a term by resident pupils between the ages of five and twenty-one by the actual number of hours school was in session in that term. To the average daily attendance of the following school term shall be added the full-time equivalent average daily attendance of summer school students.\"Full-time equivalent average daily attendance of summer school students\"shall be computed by dividing the total number of hours, except for physical education hours that do not count as credit toward graduation for students in grades nine, ten, eleven, and twelve, attended by all summer school pupils by the number of hours required in section 160.011 in the school term. For purposes of determining average daily attendance under this subdivision, the term\"resident pupil\"shall include all children between the ages of five and twenty-one who are residents of the school district and who are attending kindergarten through grade twelve in such district. If a child is attending school in a district other than the district of residence and the child's parent is teaching in the school district or is a regular employee of the school district which the child is attending, then such child shall be considered a resident pupil of the school district which the child is attending for such period of time when the district of residence is not otherwise liable for tuition. Average daily attendance for students below the age of five years for which a school district may receive state aid based on such attendance shall be computed as regular school term attendance unless otherwise provided by law;\n\n(3)\"Current operating expenditures\":\n\n(a) For the fiscal year 2007 calculation, current operating expenditures shall be calculated using data from fiscal year 2004 and shall be calculated as all expenditures for instruction and support services except capital outlay and debt service expenditures minus the revenue from federal categorical sources; food service; student activities; categorical payments for transportation costs pursuant to section 163.161; state reimbursements for early childhood special education; the career ladder entitlement for the district, as provided for in sections 168.500 to 168.515; the vocational education entitlement for the district, as provided for in section 167.332*; and payments from other districts;\n\n(b) In every fiscal year subsequent to fiscal year 2007, current operating expenditures shall be the amount in paragraph (a) of this subdivision plus any increases in state funding pursuant to sections 163.031 and 163.043 subsequent to fiscal year 2005, not to exceed five percent, per recalculation, of the state revenue received by a district in the 2004-05 school year from the foundation formula, line 14, gifted, remedial reading, exceptional pupil aid, fair share, and free textbook payments for any district from the first preceding calculation of the state adequacy target;\n\n(4)\"District's tax rate ceiling\", the highest tax rate ceiling in effect subsequent to the 1980 tax year or any subsequent year. Such tax rate ceiling shall not contain any tax levy for debt service;\n\n(5)\"Dollar-value modifier\", an index of the relative purchasing power of a dollar, calculated as one plus fifteen percent of the difference of the regional wage ratio minus one, provided that the dollar value modifier shall not be applied at a rate less than 1.0:\n\n(a)\"County wage per job\", the total county wage and salary disbursements divided by the total county wage and salary employment for each county and the City of St. Louis as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce for the fourth year preceding the payment year;\n\n(b)\"Regional wage per job\":\n\na. The total Missouri wage and salary disbursements of the metropolitan area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget divided by the total Missouri metropolitan wage and salary employment for the metropolitan area for the county signified in the school district number or the City of St. Louis, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce for the fourth year preceding the payment year and recalculated upon every decennial census to incorporate counties that are newly added to the description of metropolitan areas; or if no such metropolitan area is established, then:\n\nb. The total Missouri wage and salary disbursements of the micropolitan area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget divided by the total Missouri micropolitan wage and salary employment for the micropolitan area for the county signified in the school district number, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce for the fourth year preceding the payment year, if a micropolitan area for such county has been established and recalculated upon every decennial census to incorporate counties that are newly added to the description of micropolitan areas; or\n\nc. If a county is not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan area as established by the Office of Management and Budget, then the county wage per job, as defined in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, shall be used for the school district, as signified by the school district number;\n\n(c)\"Regional wage ratio\", the ratio of the regional wage per job divided by the state median wage per job;\n\n(d)\"State median wage per job\", the fifty-eighth highest county wage per job;\n\n(6)\"Free and reduced price lunch pupil count\", for school districts not eligible for and those that do not choose the USDA Community Eligibility Option, the number of pupils eligible for free and reduced price lunch on the last Wednesday in January for the preceding school year who were enrolled as students of the district, as approved by the department in accordance with applicable federal regulations. For eligible school districts that choose the USDA Community Eligibility Option, the free and reduced price lunch pupil count shall be the percentage of free and reduced price lunch students calculated as eligible on the last Wednesday in January of the most recent school year that included household applications to determine free and reduced price lunch count multiplied by the district's average daily attendance figure;\n\n(7)\"Free and reduced price lunch threshold\"shall be calculated by dividing the total free and reduced price lunch pupil count of every performance district that falls entirely above the bottom five percent and entirely below the top five percent of average daily attendance, when such districts are rank-ordered based on their current operating expenditures per average daily attendance, by the total average daily attendance of all included performance districts;\n\n(8)\"Limited English proficiency pupil count\", the number in the preceding school year of pupils aged three through twenty-one enrolled or preparing to enroll in an elementary school or secondary school who were not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other than English or are Native American or Alaskan native, or a native resident of the outlying areas, and come from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on such individuals' level of English language proficiency, or are migratory, whose native language is a language other than English, and who come from an environment where a language other than English is dominant; and have difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language sufficient to deny such individuals the ability to meet the state's proficient level of achievement on state assessments described in Public Law 107-10, the ability to achieve successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English, or the opportunity to participate fully in society;\n\n(9)\"Limited English proficiency threshold\"shall be calculated by dividing the total limited English proficiency pupil count of every performance district that falls entirely above the bottom five percent and entirely below the top five percent of average daily attendance, when such districts are rank-ordered based on their current operating expenditures per average daily attendance, by the total average daily attendance of all included performance districts;\n\n(10)\"Local effort\":\n\n(a) For the fiscal year 2007 calculation, local effort shall be computed as the equalized assessed valuation of the property of a school district in calendar year 2004 divided by one hundred and multiplied by the performance levy less the percentage retained by the county assessor and collector plus one hundred percent of the amount received in fiscal year 2005 for school purposes from intangible taxes, fines, escheats, payments in lieu of taxes and receipts from state-assessed railroad and utility tax, one hundred percent of the amount received for school purposes pursuant to the merchants' and manufacturers' taxes under sections 150.010 to 150.370, one hundred percent of the amounts received for school purposes from federal properties under sections 12.070 and 12.080 except when such amounts are used in the calculation of federal impact aid pursuant to P.L. 81-874, fifty percent of Proposition C revenues received for school purposes from the school district trust fund under section 163.087, and one hundred percent of any local earnings or income taxes received by the district for school purposes.

If a district's assessed valuation has decreased subsequent to the calculation outlined in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the district's local effort shall be calculated using the district's current assessed valuation in lieu of the assessed valuation utilized in the calculation outlined in paragraph (a) of this subdivision. When a change in a school district's boundary lines occurs because of a boundary line change, annexation, attachment, consolidation, reorganization, or dissolution under section 162.071, 162.081, sections 162.171 to 162.201, section 162.221, 162.223, 162.431, 162.441, or 162.451, or in the event that a school district assumes any territory from a district that ceases to exist for any reason, the department of elementary and secondary education shall make a proper adjustment to each affected district's local effort, so that each district's local effort figure conforms to the new boundary lines of the district. The department shall compute the local effort figure by applying the calendar year 2004 assessed valuation data to the new land areas resulting from the boundary line change, annexation, attachment, consolidation, reorganization, or dissolution and otherwise follow the procedures described in this subdivision;\n\n(11)\"Membership\"shall be the average of:\n\n(a) The number of resident full-time students and the full-time equivalent number of part-time students who were enrolled in the public schools of the district on the last Wednesday in September of the previous year and who were in attendance one day or more during the preceding ten school days; and\n\n(b) The number of resident full-time students and the full-time equivalent number of part-time students who were enrolled in the public schools of the district on the last Wednesday in January of the previous year and who were in attendance one day or more during the preceding ten school days, plus the full-time equivalent number of summer school pupils.\"Full-time equivalent number of part-time students\"is determined by dividing the total number of hours for which all part-time students are enrolled by the number of hours in the school term.\"Full-time equivalent number of summer school pupils\"is determined by dividing the total number of hours for which all summer school pupils were enrolled by the number of hours required pursuant to section 160.011 in the school term. Only students eligible to be counted for average daily attendance shall be counted for membership;\n\n(12)\"Operating levy for school purposes\", the sum of tax rates levied for teachers' and incidental funds plus the operating levy or sales tax equivalent pursuant to section 162.1100 of any transitional school district containing the school district, in the payment year, not including any equalized operating levy for school purposes levied by a special school district in which the district is located;\n\n(13)\"Performance district\", any district that has met performance standards and indicators as established by the department of elementary and secondary education for purposes of accreditation under section 161.092 and as reported on the final annual performance report for that district each year; for calculations to be utilized for payments in fiscal years subsequent to fiscal year 2018, the number of performance districts shall not exceed twenty-five percent of all public school districts;\n\n(14)\"Performance levy\", three dollars and forty-three cents;\n\n(15)\"School purposes\"pertains to teachers' and incidental funds;\n\n(16)\"Special education pupil count\", the number of public school students with a current individualized education program or services plan and receiving services from the resident district as of December first of the preceding school year, except for special education services provided through a school district established under sections 162.815 to 162.940 in a county with a charter form of government and with more than one million inhabitants, in which case the sum of the students in each district within the county exceeding the special education threshold of each respective district within the county shall be counted within the special district and not in the district of residence for purposes of distributing the state aid derived from the special education pupil count;\n\n(17)\"Special education threshold\"shall be calculated by dividing the total special education pupil count of every performance district that falls entirely above the bottom five percent and entirely below the top five percent of average daily attendance, when such districts are rank-ordered based on their current operating expenditures per average daily attendance, by the total average daily attendance of all included performance districts;\n\n(18)\"State adequacy target\", the sum of the current operating expenditures of every performance district that falls entirely above the bottom five percent and entirely below the top five percent of average daily attendance, when such districts are rank-ordered based on their current operating expenditures per average daily attendance, divided by the total average daily attendance of all included performance districts. The department of elementary and secondary education shall first calculate the state adequacy target for fiscal year 2007 and recalculate the state adequacy target every two years using the most current available data. The recalculation shall never result in a decrease from the state adequacy target as calculated for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and any state adequacy target figure calculated subsequent to fiscal year 2018. Should a recalculation result in an increase in the state adequacy target amount, fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state adequacy target amount in the year of recalculation, and fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state adequacy target amount in the subsequent year.

Eligibility for state aid, requirements — evaluation of correlation of rates and assessed valuation, report, calculation — further requirements — exception — operating levy less than performance levy, requirements. —1. A school district shall receive state aid for its education program only if it:\n\n(1) Provides for a minimum of one hundred seventy-four days and one thousand forty-four hours of actual pupil attendance in a term scheduled by the board pursuant to section 160.041 for each pupil or group of pupils, except that the board shall provide a minimum of one hundred seventy-four days and five hundred twenty-two hours of actual pupil attendance in a term for kindergarten pupils. If any school is dismissed because of inclement weather after school has been in session for three hours, that day shall count as a school day including afternoon session kindergarten students. When the aggregate hours lost in a term due to inclement weather decreases the total hours of the school term below the required minimum number of hours by more than twelve hours for all-day students or six hours for one-half-day kindergarten students, all such hours below the minimum must be made up in one-half day or full day additions to the term, except as provided in section 171.033. In school year 2019-20 and subsequent years, one thousand forty-four hours of actual pupil attendance with no minimum number of school days shall be required for each pupil or group of pupils; except that, the board shall provide a minimum of five hundred twenty-two hours of actual pupil attendance in a term for kindergarten pupils with no minimum number of school days;\n\n(2) Maintains adequate and accurate records of attendance, personnel and finances, as required by the state board of education, which shall include the preparation of a financial statement which shall be submitted to the state board of education the same as required by the provisions of section 165.111 for districts;\n\n(3) Levies an operating levy for school purposes of not less than one dollar and twenty-five cents after all adjustments and reductions on each one hundred dollars assessed valuation of the district; and\n\n(4) Computes average daily attendance as defined in subdivision (2) of section 163.011 as modified by section 171.031.

Any district which is required, pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, to reduce its operating levy below the minimum tax rate otherwise required under this subsection shall not be construed to be in violation of this subsection for making such tax rate reduction. Pursuant to Section 10(c) of Article X of the state constitution, a school district may levy the operating levy for school purposes required by this subsection less all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution if such rate does not exceed the highest tax rate in effect subsequent to the 1980 tax year.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any school district located in a county of the second classification which has a nuclear power plant located in such district or to any school district located in a county of the third classification which has an electric power generation unit with a rated generating capacity of more than one hundred fifty megawatts which is owned or operated or both by a rural electric cooperative except that such school districts may levy for current school purposes and capital projects an operating levy not to exceed two dollars and seventy-five cents less all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution.\n\n3. No school district shall receive more state aid, as calculated in section 163.031, for its education program, exclusive of categorical add-ons, than it received per eligible pupil for the school year 1993-94, if the state board of education determines that the district was not in compliance in the preceding school year with the requirements of section 163.172, until such time as the board determines that the district is again in compliance with the requirements of section 163.172.\n\n4. No school district shall receive state aid, pursuant to section 163.031, if such district was not in compliance, during the preceding school year, with the requirement, established pursuant to section 160.530 to allocate revenue to the professional development committee of the district.\n\n5. No school district shall receive more state aid, as calculated in subsections 1 and 2 of section 163.031, for its education program, exclusive of categorical add-ons, than it received per weighted average daily attendance for the school year 2005-06 from the foundation formula, line 14, gifted, remedial reading, exceptional pupil aid, fair share, and free textbook payment amounts, if the district did not comply in the preceding school year with the requirements of subsection 5 of section 163.031.\n\n6. Any school district that levies an operating levy for school purposes that is less than the performance levy, as such term is defined in section 163.011, shall provide written notice to the department of elementary and secondary education asserting that the district is providing an adequate education to the students of such district. If a school district asserts that it is not providing an adequate education to its students, such inadequacy shall be deemed to be a result of insufficient local effort. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any special district established under sections 162.815 to 162.940.\n\n(L. 1963 p. 200 § 4-2, A.L. 1973 H.B. 38, A.L. 1982 S.B. 832, A.L. 1983 S.B. 39, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1456 & 1197, A.L. 1988 S.B. 797, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1478, et al., A.L. 1993 S.B. 380, A.L. 1996 S.B. 795, et al., A.L. 1997 H.B. 105, A.L. 1998 S.B. 781, A.L. 2005 S.B. 287, A.L. 2006 S.B. 894, A.L. 2015 H.B. 41, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1606 merged with S.B. 743)\n\n(Source: RSMo 1959 § 161.025)\n\n*This section was amended by S.B. 727, 2024.

Estimates of weighted average daily attendance, authorized, how computed — summer school computation — error in computation between actual and estimated attendance, how corrected — use of assessed valuation for state aid — delinquency in payment of property tax, effect on assessment. —1. In computing the amount of state aid a school district is entitled to receive for the minimum school term only under section 163.031, a school district may use an estimate of the weighted average daily attendance for the current year, or the weighted average daily attendance for the immediately preceding year or the weighted average daily attendance for the second preceding school year, whichever is greater. Beginning with the 2006-07 school year, the summer school attendance included in the average daily attendance as defined in subdivision (2) of section 163.011 shall include only the attendance hours of pupils that attend summer school in the current year. Beginning with the 2004-05 school year, when a district's official calendar for the current year contributes to a more than ten percent reduction in the average daily attendance for kindergarten compared to the immediately preceding year, the payment attributable to kindergarten shall include only the current year kindergarten average daily attendance. Any error made in the apportionment of state aid because of a difference between the actual weighted average daily attendance and the estimated weighted average daily attendance shall be corrected as provided in section 163.091, except that if the amount paid to a district estimating weighted average daily attendance exceeds the amount to which the district was actually entitled by more than five percent, interest at the rate of six percent shall be charged on the excess and shall be added to the amount to be deducted from the district's apportionment the next succeeding year.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section or any other provision of law, the state board of education shall make an adjustment for the immediately preceding year for any increase in the actual weighted average daily attendance above the number on which the state aid in section 163.031 was calculated. Said adjustment shall be made in the manner providing for correction of errors under subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. Any error made in the apportionment of state aid because of a difference between the actual equalized assessed valuation for the current year and the estimated equalized assessed valuation for the current year shall be corrected as provided in section 163.091, except that if the amount paid to a district estimating current equalized assessed valuation exceeds the amount to which the district was actually entitled, interest at the rate of six percent shall be charged on the excess and shall be added to the amount to be deducted from the district's apportionment the next succeeding year.\n\n4. For the purposes of distribution of state school aid pursuant to section 163.031, a school district with ten percent or more of its assessed valuation that is owned by one person or corporation as commercial or personal property who is delinquent in a property tax payment may elect, after receiving notice from the county clerk on or before March fifteenth that more than ten percent of its current taxes due the preceding December thirty-first by a single property owner are delinquent, to use in the local effort calculation of the state aid formula the district's equalized assessed valuation for the preceding year or the actual assessed valuation of the year for which the taxes are delinquent less the assessed valuation of property for which the current year's property tax is delinquent. To qualify for use of the actual assessed valuation of the year for which the taxes are delinquent less the assessed valuation of property for which the current year's property tax is delinquent, a district must notify the department of elementary and secondary education on or before April first, except in the year enacted, of the current year amount of delinquent taxes, the assessed valuation of such property for which delinquent taxes are owed and the total assessed valuation of the district for the year in which the taxes were due but not paid. Any district giving such notice to the department of elementary and secondary education shall present verification of the accuracy of such notice obtained from the clerk of the county levying delinquent taxes. When any of the delinquent taxes identified by such notice are paid during a four-year period following the due date, the county clerk shall give notice to the district and the department of elementary and secondary education, and state aid paid to the district shall be reduced by an amount equal to the delinquent taxes received plus interest. The reduction in state aid shall occur over a period not to exceed five years and the interest rate on excess state aid not refunded shall be six percent annually.\n\n5. If a district receives state aid based on equalized assessed valuation as determined by subsection 4 of this section and if prior to such notice the district was paid state aid pursuant to section 163.031, the amount of state aid paid during the year of such notice and the first year following shall equal the sum of state aid paid pursuant to section 163.031 plus the difference between the state aid amount being paid after such notice minus the amount of state aid the district would have received pursuant to section 163.031 before such notice. To be eligible to receive state aid based on this provision the district must levy during the first year following such notice at least the maximum levy permitted school districts by Article X, Section 11(b) of the Missouri Constitution and have a voluntary rollback of its tax rate which is no greater than one cent per one hundred dollars assessed valuation.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 248, A.L. 1969 p. 268, A.L. 1977 H.B. 131, A.L. 1982 Adopted by Initiative, Proposition C, November 2, 1982, A.L. 1991 S.B. 411, A.L. 1993 S.B. 380, A.L. 1997 H.B. 641 & 593, A.L. 1999 H.B. 889, A.L. 2000 S.B. 573, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1711, A.L. 2004 S.B. 968 and S.B. 969, A.L. 2005 S.B. 287)\n\nEffective 7-01-06",

State aid to community colleges — definitions — distribution to be based on resource allocation model, adjustment annually, factors involved — report on effectiveness of model, due when. —1. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Community college\", an institution of higher education deriving financial resources from local, state, and federal sources, and providing postsecondary education primarily for persons above the twelfth grade age level, including courses in:\n\n(a) Liberal arts and sciences, including general education;\n\n(b) Occupational, vocational-technical; and\n\n(c) A variety of educational community services.\n\n­­Community college course offerings shall generally lead to the granting of certificates, diplomas, or associate degrees, and may include baccalaureate degrees only when authorized by the coordinating board for higher education in circumstances where the level of education required in a field for accreditation or licensure increases to the baccalaureate degree level or, in the case of applied bachelor's degrees, the level of education required for employment in a field increases to that level, and when doing so would not unnecessarily duplicate an existing program, collaboration with a university is not feasible or the approach is not a viable means of meeting the needs of students and employers, and the institution has the academic and financial capacity to offer the program in a high-quality manner. Quality for such baccalaureate degree programs shall be evaluated at least in part by the delivery of upper-level coursework or competencies, and defined by accreditation or compliance with the Higher Learning Commission standards for bachelor's degrees;\n\n(2)\"Operating costs\", all costs attributable to current operations, including all direct costs of instruction, instructors' and counselors' compensation, administrative costs, all normal operating costs and all similar noncapital expenditures during any year, excluding costs of construction of facilities and the purchase of equipment, furniture, and other capital items authorized and funded in accordance with subsection 6 of this section.

The department's budget request shall include a recommended level of funding.\n\n3. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, distribution of appropriated funds to community college districts shall be in accordance with the community college resource allocation model. This model shall be developed and revised as appropriate cooperatively by the community colleges and the department of higher education and workforce development. The department of higher education and workforce development shall recommend the model to the coordinating board for higher education for their approval. The core funding level for each community college shall initially be established at an amount agreed upon by the community colleges and the department of higher education and workforce development. This amount will be adjusted annually for inflation, limited growth, and program improvements in accordance with the resource allocation model starting with fiscal year 1993.\n\n(2) Unless the general assembly chooses to otherwise appropriate state funding, beginning in fiscal year 2016, at least ninety percent of any increase in core funding over the appropriated amount for the previous fiscal year shall be distributed in accordance with the achievement of performance-funding measures under section 173.1006.\n\n4.

In addition to state funds received for operating purposes, each community college district shall be eligible to receive an annual appropriation, exclusive of any capital appropriations, for the cost of maintenance and repair of facilities and grounds, including surface parking areas, and purchases of equipment and furniture.

The coordinating board, as part of its process of application, evaluation, and approval, shall require the community college district to provide proof that the fifty-percent share of funding to be defrayed by the district is either on hand or committed for maintenance, repair, and equipment projects. Only salaries or portions of salaries paid which are directly related to approved projects may be used as a part of the fifty-percent share of funding.\n\n7. School districts offering two-year college courses pursuant to section 178.370 on October 31, 1961, shall receive state aid pursuant to subsection 2, subdivision (1) of subsection 3, and subsection 6 of this section if all scholastic standards established pursuant to sections 178.770 to 178.890 are met.\n\n8.

The classes conducted outside the district shall be self-sustaining except that the coordinating board shall promulgate rules to reimburse selected out-of-district instruction only where prior need has been established in geographical areas designated by the coordinating board for higher education. Funding for such off-campus instruction shall be included in the appropriation recommendations, shall be determined by the general assembly and shall continue, within the amounts appropriated therefor, unless the general assembly disapproves the action by concurrent resolution.\n\n9.
