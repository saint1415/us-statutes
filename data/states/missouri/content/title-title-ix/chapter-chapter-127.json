When it appears to the attorney general that a person has violated any provision of this chapter or when he or she believes it to be in the public interest that an investigation should be made to ascertain whether a person in fact has violated this chapter, he or she may execute in writing and cause to be served upon any person who is believed to have information, documentary material, or physical evidence relevant to the alleged or suspected violation, a civil investigative demand requiring such person to appear and testify, or to produce relevant documentary material or physical evidence or examination, at such reasonable time and place as may be stated in the civil investigative demand. Service of any civil investigative demand, notice, or subpoena may be made by any person authorized by law to serve process or by any duly authorized employee of the attorney general.\n\n2.
