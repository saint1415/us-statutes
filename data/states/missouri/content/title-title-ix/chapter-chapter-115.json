Application for an absentee ballot may be made by the applicant in person, or by mail, or for the applicant, in person, by his or her guardian or a relative within the second degree by consanguinity or affinity. The election authority shall accept applications by facsimile transmission and by electronic mail within the limits of its telecommunications capacity.\n\n2. Notwithstanding section 115.284, no individual, group, or party shall solicit a voter into obtaining an absentee ballot application. Absentee ballot applications shall not have the information prefilled prior to it being provided to a voter. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit a state or local election authority from assisting an individual voter.\n\n3. Each application shall be made to the election authority of the jurisdiction in which the person is or would be registered. Each application shall be in writing and shall state the applicant's name, address at which he or she is or would be registered, his or her reason for voting an absentee ballot, the address to which the ballot is to be mailed, if mailing is requested, and for absent uniformed services and overseas applicants, the applicant's email address if electronic transmission is requested. If the reason for the applicant voting absentee is due to the reasons established under subdivision (6) of subsection 3 of section 115.277, the applicant shall state the voter's identification information provided by the address confidentiality program in lieu of the applicant's name, address at which he or she is or would be registered, and address to which the ballot is to be mailed, if mailing is requested. Each application to vote in a primary election shall also state which ballot the applicant wishes to receive. If any application fails to designate a ballot, the election authority shall, within three working days after receiving the application, notify the applicant by mail that it will be unable to deliver an absentee ballot until the applicant designates which political party ballot he or she wishes to receive. If the applicant does not respond to the request for political party designation, the election authority is authorized to provide the voter with that part of the ballot for which no political party designation is required.\n\n4. All applications for absentee ballots received prior to the sixth Tuesday before an election shall be stored at the office of the election authority until such time as the applications are processed in accordance with section 115.281. No application for an absentee ballot received in the office of the election authority by mail, by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail, or by a guardian or relative after 5:00 p.m. on the second Wednesday immediately prior to the election shall be accepted by any election authority. No application for an absentee ballot submitted by the applicant in person after 5:00 p.m. on the day before the election shall be accepted by any election authority, except as provided in subsections 7, 8, and 9 of this section.\n\n5. Each application for an absentee ballot shall be signed by the applicant or, if the application is made by a guardian or relative pursuant to this section, the application shall be signed by the guardian or relative, who shall note on the application his or her relationship to the applicant. If an applicant, guardian or relative is blind, unable to read or write the English language or physically incapable of signing the application, he or she shall sign by mark, witnessed by the signature of an election official or person of his or her own choosing. Any person who knowingly makes, delivers or mails a fraudulent absentee ballot application shall be guilty of a class one election offense.\n\n6. (1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any resident of the state of Missouri who resides outside the boundaries of the United States or who is on active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States or members of their immediate family living with them may request an absentee ballot for both the primary and subsequent general election with one application.\n\n(2) The election authority shall provide each absent uniformed services voter and each overseas voter who submits a voter registration application or an absentee ballot request, if the election authority rejects the application or request, with the reasons for the rejection.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if a standard oath regarding material misstatements of fact is adopted for uniformed and overseas voters pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002, the election authority shall accept such oath for voter registration, absentee ballot, or other election-related materials.\n\n(4) Not later than sixty days after the date of each regularly scheduled general election for federal office, each election authority which administered the election shall submit to the secretary of state in a format prescribed by the secretary a report on the combined number of absentee ballots transmitted to, and returned by, absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters for the election. The secretary shall submit to the Election Assistance Commission a combined report of such information not later than ninety days after the date of each regularly scheduled general election for federal office and in a standardized format developed by the commission pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The secretary shall make the report available to the general public.\n\n(5) As used in this section, the terms \"absent uniformed services voter\" and \"overseas voter\" shall have the meaning prescribed in 52 U.S.C. Section 20310.\n\n7. An application for an absentee ballot by a new resident shall be submitted in person by the applicant in the office of the election authority in the election jurisdiction in which such applicant resides. The application shall be received by the election authority no later than 7:00 p.m. on the day of the election. Such application shall be in the form of an affidavit, executed in duplicate in the presence of the election authority or any authorized officer of the election authority, and in substantially the following form:\n\n8. The election authority in whose office an application is filed pursuant to subsection 7 of this section shall immediately send a duplicate of such application to the appropriate official of the state in which the new resident applicant last resided and shall file the original of such application in its office.\n\n9. An application for an absentee ballot by an interstate former resident shall be received in the office of the election authority where the applicant was formerly registered by 5:00 p.m. on the second Wednesday immediately prior to the election, unless the application is made in person by the applicant in the office of the election authority, in which case such application shall be made no later than 7:00 p.m. on the day of the election.\n\n(L. 1977 H.B. 101 § 9.010, A.L. 1988 H.B. 933, et al., A.L. 1995 H.B. 484, et al., A.L. 1996 H.B. 1557 & 1489, A.L. 1997 S.B. 132, A.L. 2002 S.B. 675, A.L. 2003 H.B. 511, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1524 & 2260, A.L. 2015 S.B. 34 & 105, A.L. 2018 S.B. 592, A.L. 2022 H.B. 1878)",

Provisional ballots, used when, exceptions, procedure, counted when, how — rulemaking authority — free access system established — provisional ballot only used, when — no jurisdiction in state courts to extend polling hours. —1. This section shall apply to primary and general elections where candidates for federal or statewide offices are nominated or elected and any election where statewide issue or issues are submitted to the voters.\n\n2. (1) A voter claiming to be properly registered in the jurisdiction of the election authority and eligible to vote in an election, but whose eligibility at that precinct cannot be immediately established upon examination of the precinct register, shall be entitled to vote a provisional ballot after providing a form of personal identification required pursuant to section 115.427 or upon executing an affidavit under section 115.427, or may vote at a central polling place as established in section 115.115 where the voter may vote his or her appropriate ballot for his or her precinct of residence upon verification of eligibility or vote a provisional ballot if eligibility cannot be determined. The provisional ballot provided to a voter under this section shall be the ballot provided to a resident of the voter's precinct determined by reference to the affidavit provided for in this section. If the voter declares that the voter is eligible to vote and the election authority determines that the voter is eligible to vote at another polling place, the voter shall be directed to the correct polling place or a central polling place as established by the election authority pursuant to subsection 5 of section 115.115. If the voter refuses to go to the correct polling place or a central polling place, the voter shall be permitted to vote a provisional ballot at the incorrect polling place, but such ballot shall not be counted if the voter was not eligible to vote at that polling place.\n\n(2) The following steps shall be taken to establish a voter's eligibility to vote at a polling place:\n\n(a) The election judge shall examine the precinct register as provided in section 115.425. If the voter is registered and eligible to vote at the polling place, the voter shall receive a regular ballot;\n\n(b) If the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately established by examining the precinct register, the election judge shall contact the election authority. If the election authority cannot immediately establish that the voter is registered and eligible to vote at the polling place upon examination of the Missouri voter registration system, or if the election judge is unable to make contact with the election authority immediately, the voter shall be notified that the voter is entitled to a provisional ballot.\n\n(3) The voter shall have the duty to appear and vote at the correct polling place. If an election judge determines that the voter is not eligible to vote at the polling place at which a voter presents himself or herself, and if the voter appears to be eligible to vote at another polling place, the voter shall be informed that he or she may cast a provisional ballot at the current polling place or may travel to the correct polling place or a central polling place, as established by the election authority under subsection 5 of section 115.115, where the voter may cast a regular ballot or provisional ballot if the voter's eligibility still cannot be determined. Provisional ballots cast at a polling place shall be counted only if the voter was eligible to vote at such polling place as provided in subsection 5 of this section.\n\n(4) For a voter requesting an absentee ballot in person, such voter shall be entitled to cast a provisional ballot when the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately established upon examination of the precinct registers or the Missouri voter registration system.\n\n(5) Prior to accepting any provisional ballot at the polling place, the election judges shall determine that the information provided on the provisional ballot envelope by the provisional voter is consistent with the identification provided by such person under section 115.427.\n\n3. (1) No person shall be entitled to receive a provisional ballot until such person has completed a provisional ballot affidavit on the provisional ballot envelope.\n\n(2) The secretary of state shall produce appropriate sizes of provisional ballot envelopes and distribute them to each election authority according to their tabulating system. All provisional ballot envelopes shall be printed on a distinguishable color of paper that is different from the color of the regular ballot. The provisional ballot envelope shall be in the form required by subsection 4 of this section. All provisional ballots shall be marked with a conspicuous stamp or other distinguishing mark that makes them readily distinguishable from the regular ballots.\n\n(3) Once voted, the provisional ballot shall be placed and sealed in a provisional ballot envelope.\n\n4. The provisional ballot in its envelope shall be deposited in the ballot box. The provisional ballot envelope shall be completed by the voter for use in determining eligibility. The provisional ballot envelope specified in this section shall contain a voter's certificate which shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­The voter may provide additional information to further assist the election authority in determining eligibility, including the place and date the voter registered to vote, if known.\n\n5. (1) Prior to counting any provisional ballot, the election authority shall determine if the voter is registered and eligible to vote and if the vote was properly cast. The eligibility of provisional votes shall be determined according to the requirements for a voter to cast a ballot in the election as set forth in sections 115.133 and 115.135. A provisional voter ballot shall not be eligible to be counted until the election authority has determined that:\n\n(a) The voter cast such provisional ballot at a polling place established for the voter or the central polling place established by the election authority under subsection 5 of section 115.115;\n\n(b) The individual who cast the provisional ballot is an individual registered to vote in the respective election at the polling place where the ballot was cast;\n\n(c) The voter did not otherwise vote in the same election by regular ballot, absentee ballot, or otherwise; and\n\n(d) The information on the provisional ballot envelope is found to be correct, complete, and accurate.\n\n(2) When the ballot boxes are delivered to the election authority from the polling places, the receiving teams shall separate the provisional ballots from the rest of the ballots and place the sealed provisional ballot envelopes in a separate container. Teams of election authority employees or teams of election judges with each team consisting of one member of each major political party shall photocopy each provisional ballot envelope, such photocopy to be used by the election authority to determine provisional voter eligibility. The sealed provisional ballot envelopes shall be placed by the team in a sealed container and shall remain therein until tabulation.\n\n(3) To determine whether a provisional ballot is valid and entitled to be counted, the election authority shall examine its records and verify that the provisional voter is properly registered and eligible to vote in the election. If the provisional voter has provided information regarding the registration agency where the provisional voter registered to vote, the election authority shall make an inquiry of the registration agency to determine whether the provisional voter is properly registered and eligible to vote in the election.\n\n(4) If the election authority determines that the provisional voter is registered and eligible to vote in the election, the election authority shall provide documentation verifying the voter's eligibility. Such documentation shall be noted on the copy of the provisional ballot envelope and shall contain substantially the following information:\n\n(a) The name of the provisional voter;\n\n(b) The name of the reviewer;\n\n(c) The date and time; and\n\n(d) A description of evidence found that supports the voter's eligibility.\n\n(5) The local election authority shall record on a provisional ballot acceptance/rejection list the provisional ballot identification number and a notation marking it as accepted.\n\n(6) If the election authority determines that the provisional voter is not registered or eligible to vote in the election, the election authority shall provide documentation verifying the voter's ineligibility. Such documentation shall be noted on the copy of the provisional ballot envelope and shall contain substantially the following information:\n\n(a) The name of the provisional voter;\n\n(b) The name of the reviewer;\n\n(c) The date and time;\n\n(d) A description of why the voter is ineligible.\n\n(7) The local election authority shall record on a provisional ballot acceptance/rejection list the provisional ballot identification number and notation marking it as rejected.\n\n(8) If rejected, a photocopy of the envelope shall be made and used by the election authority as a mail-in voter registration. The actual provisional ballot envelope shall be kept as ballot material, and the copy of the envelope shall be used by the election authority for registration record keeping.\n\n6. All provisional ballots cast by voters whose eligibility has been verified as provided in this section shall be counted in accordance with the rules governing ballot tabulation. Provisional ballots shall not be counted until all provisional ballots are determined either eligible or ineligible and all provisional ballots must be processed before the election is certified. The provisional ballot shall be counted only if the election authority determines that the voter is registered and eligible to vote. Provisional ballots voted in the wrong polling place shall not be counted. If the voter is not registered but is qualified to register for future elections, the affidavit shall be considered a mail-in application to register to vote pursuant to this chapter.\n\n7. (1) After the election authority completes its review of the provisional voter's eligibility under subsection 5 of this section, the election authority shall deliver the provisional ballots and copies of the provisional ballot envelopes that include eligibility information to bipartisan counting teams, which may be the board of verification, for review and tabulation. The election authority shall maintain a record of such delivery. The record shall include the number of ballots delivered to each team and shall include a signed receipt from two judges, one from each major political party. The election authority shall provide each team with a ballot box and material necessary for tabulation.\n\n(2) If the person named on the provisional ballot affidavit is found to have been properly qualified and registered to cast a ballot in the election and the provisional ballot otherwise qualifies to be counted under the provisions of this section, the envelope shall be opened, and the ballot shall be placed in a ballot box to be counted.\n\n(3) If the person named on the provisional ballot affidavit is found not to have been properly qualified and registered to cast a ballot in the election or if the election authority is unable to determine such person's right to vote, the envelope containing the provisional ballot shall not be opened, and the person's vote shall not be counted. The members of the team shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection 5 of this section for rejected provisional ballots.\n\n(4) The votes shall be tallied and the returns made as provided in sections 115.447 to 115.525 for paper ballots. After the vote on all ballots assigned to a team have been counted, the ballots, ballot envelopes, and copies of ballot envelopes with the eligibility information provided by the election authority shall be enclosed in sealed containers marked \"Voted provisional ballots and ballot envelopes from the election held ______, 20______\". All rejected provisional ballots, ballot envelopes, and copies of ballot envelopes with the eligibility information provided by the election authority shall be enclosed in sealed containers marked \"Rejected provisional ballots and ballot envelopes from the election held ______, 20______\".

Pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002, the secretary of state shall ensure a free access system is established, such as a toll-free number or an internet website, that any individual who casts a provisional ballot may access to discover whether the vote of that individual was counted, and, if the vote was not counted, the reason that the vote was not counted. At the time an individual casts a provisional ballot, the election authority shall give the voter written information that states that any individual who casts a provisional ballot will be able to ascertain under such free access system whether the vote was counted, and if the vote was not counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.\n\n14. In accordance with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, any individual who votes in an election as a result of a court order or any other order extending the time established for closing the polls in section 115.407 may vote only by using a provisional ballot, and such provisional ballot shall be separated and held apart from other provisional ballots cast by those not affected by the order.
