Out-of-service orders against motor carriers, actions of commission, notice, responsibilities of motor carriers — admissibility of orders — hearing and review of order, venue, procedure — review and disclosure of information — update of records — enforcement — liability. —1. Whenever the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the United States Department of Transportation, or the state highways and transportation commission issues an out-of-service order against a motor carrier, as those terms are defined in Section 390.5 of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, as those regulations have been and periodically may be amended, the commission may immediately, without hearing, order the suspension, revocation, cancellation, confiscation, or any of these, of every license, registration, certificate, permit, and other credential issued to the motor carrier by the commission's authority under section 226.008 and every motor vehicle license plate issued under any provision of chapter 301 which authorizes the operation of motor vehicles in intrastate or interstate commerce by that motor carrier. This section is applicable to out-of-service orders placing a motor carrier's entire operation out of service, but does not apply to any out-of-service order placing an individual driver or individual vehicle out of service.\n\n(1) The commission immediately shall serve notice of its order upon the affected motor carrier, and upon the director of revenue, in the manner authorized by section 622.410, or any other manner authorized by law for the service of notice of the commission's orders. The notice or order shall state a specific effective date for the commission's action or, in the commission's discretion, that its action shall become effective immediately upon the service of the notice or order upon the motor carrier. The order shall remain in force until ordered otherwise by the commission or by a court having proper jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Whenever an order of the commission issued under subsection 1 of this section is in force, a motor carrier who is prohibited by the order from operating commercial motor vehicles shall not operate any commercial motor vehicles and shall not allow any employee, agent, lessor, or other person acting under the motor carrier's authority or control to operate any commercial motor vehicles in intrastate or interstate commerce within this state. Upon receiving notice of the commission's order, the motor carrier immediately shall surrender all license plates, motor carrier licenses, registrations, permits, and other credentials as directed by the commission's order. While the out-of-service order is in force, the commission and department of revenue may dismiss or deny every application for the issuance of any of these credentials issued by that respective agency to that motor carrier.\n\n(3) After the commission has issued an order under this section, the out-of-service motor carrier shall not be eligible to apply for the issuance or reinstatement of and the commission or department of revenue shall not issue or reinstate any license plate, motor carrier license, registration, permit, certificate, or other credential issued by that respective agency described in the commission's order, until the out-of-service order and any commission orders issued under this subsection have been rescinded by the agency that issued these orders, or the orders have been set aside by a court having proper jurisdiction.\n\n2. In any commission or court proceeding, a copy of any federal or state order described in subsection 1 of this section shall be admissible and shall constitute prima facie evidence that the motor carrier violated Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, or that the motor carrier's operation of commercial motor vehicles poses an imminent hazard to safety, or both, as stated in that order.\n\n3. Any person who is aggrieved by an order of the highways and transportation commission issued under this section, or by any out-of-service order issued by commission enforcement personnel under section 390.201 or subsection 3 of section 307.400, may apply to the circuit court for a hearing and review of the order. Venue of such judicial review shall lie within the county of the first classification with more than seventy-one thousand three hundred but fewer than seventy-one thousand four hundred inhabitants, or in the county where the out-of-service order was issued to the motor carrier. The right to a hearing and judicial review of the commission's orders under this section shall be waived, unless an aggrieved person files a petition for review with the clerk of the circuit court in the proper venue, not later than thirty days following issuance of the order to be reviewed. Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 622.430 to 622.450 shall govern the judicial review of orders issued by the commission or its personnel as described in this section. In addition to any other interested parties, the commission shall have the right to appear in all hearing and review proceedings under this section, and may, in its discretion, defend any order or notice issued and any action taken by any public agency or officer acting in good faith under the provisions of this section. This section shall not be construed as conferring any jurisdiction to review, amend, vacate, or set aside any orders issued by a federal agency or federal officer.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the highways and transportation commission may receive and disclose any data, information, or evidence relating to any out-of-service motor carrier as provided in this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, this data may include, but is not limited to, the identity and location of any persons known or reasonably believed to have leased motor vehicles with or without driver to the out-of-service motor carrier, any persons known or reasonably believed to be operating commercial motor vehicles under the authority or control of the out-of-service motor carrier, and any motor vehicles owned, operated by, or leased to the out-of-service motor carrier or those persons, including the vehicle identification numbers. The commission, in its discretion, may disclose this data to the following entities, which are hereby authorized to receive such data from, and to disclose such data to, the commission:\n\n(1) The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and other relevant officials of the United States Department of Transportation;\n\n(2) The department of revenue;\n\n(3) The Missouri state highway patrol, and any other peace officers authorized to exercise police powers within the state;\n\n(4) Similarly authorized law enforcement agencies of any other state, of the United States government, or of any foreign government having legal authority to promote or enforce motor carrier safety;\n\n(5) Any liability insurer or surety that provides, or has an interest in providing, automobile liability insurance coverage for the out-of-service motor carrier, or for any person who leases, or proposes to lease, motor vehicles to be operated by or under the authority or control of the out-of-service motor carrier; and\n\n(6) Attorneys representing a person identified in this subsection; except that the commission may disclose to such attorneys only data relating to their client, their client's employer or employee, or their client's lessor or lessee with reference to a motor vehicle.\n\n5. Upon receiving notice of any order issued by the highways and transportation commission under subsection 1 of this section, together with any additional information reasonably required by the director of revenue, the director of revenue may immediately, without hearing, update the director's records to reflect the suspension, revocation, or cancellation of all motor vehicle license plates, registrations, and other credentials issued to the out-of-service motor carrier by the director of revenue. The director of revenue shall immediately notify the motor carrier, and the commission, of all actions taken pursuant to the commission's order. The motor carrier shall have the right to seek judicial review of the commission's order, including the suspension, revocation, or cancellation of motor vehicle license plates and registrations under the commission's order, as provided in subsection 3 of this section. The motor carrier shall not be entitled to any separate appeal or review of the director of revenue's notice of suspension, revocation, or cancellation of motor vehicle licenses or registrations, or any other actions taken by the director of revenue under the commission's order.\n\n6. The commission may authorize any of its personnel to enforce any provision of this section, or any out-of-service orders described in this section, in the same manner provided by law for other orders of the commission authorized under section 226.008. The Missouri state highway patrol and other peace officers within this state may enforce the requirements of this section and of any orders issued under this section. If so authorized by the commission's order under this section, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, personnel of the state department of transportation and the state highway patrol may confiscate any license plates, motor carrier licenses, registrations, certificates, permits, and other credentials issued to the motor carrier by the commission, the director of revenue, the department of revenue, or all of these.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, the state of Missouri, the highways and transportation commission, the state highway patrol, and any peace officers or other public officers acting in good faith under the authority of this section shall not be held liable or required to pay any refund of any fees, taxes, assessments, penalties, fines, forfeitures, or other payments that may be charged to, received, or collected from the out-of-service motor carrier, or from persons whose motor vehicles are leased to or operated under the control of that motor carrier, in relation to any license plate, motor carrier license, registration, permit, certificate, or other credential that is suspended, revoked, cancelled, or confiscated under any provisions of this section.\n\n8. Any act or omission by a state agency that this section authorizes or requires with reference to an out-of-service motor carrier, or with reference to motor vehicles operated by an out-of-service motor carrier, is likewise authorized or required with reference to:\n\n(1) Any person who operates motor vehicles under the actual control of that motor carrier, and any person who operates motor vehicles that are leased to that motor carrier, with or without driver; and\n\n(2) Any motor vehicles operated under the actual control of that motor carrier, and any motor vehicles that are leased to that motor carrier, with or without driver.\n\n(L. 2006 S.B. 1001, et al.)",

Signs permitted on certain highways — lighting restrictions — size, location — zones — specifications. —Notwithstanding any other provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600, outdoor advertising shall be permitted within six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way of highways located on the interstate, federal-aid primary system as it existed on June 1, 1991, or the national highway system as amended in areas zoned industrial, commercial or the like and in unzoned commercial and industrial areas as defined in this section, subject to the following regulations which are consistent with customary use in this state:\n\n(1) Lighting:\n\n(a) No revolving or rotating beam or beacon of light that simulates any emergency light or device shall be permitted as part of any sign. No flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights will be permitted except scoreboards and other illuminated signs designating public service information, such as time, date, or temperature, or similar information, will be allowed; tri-vision, projection, and other changeable message signs shall be allowed subject to Missouri highways and transportation commission regulations;\n\n(b) External lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and gooseneck reflectors are permitted, provided the light source is directed upon the face of the sign and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed into any portion of the main traveled way of the federal-aid primary highways as of June 1, 1991, and all highways designated as part of the National Highway System by the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 and those highways subsequently designated as part of the National Highway System and the lights are not of such intensity so as to cause glare, impair the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with a driver's operation of a motor vehicle;\n\n(c) No sign shall be so illuminated that it interferes with the effectiveness of, or obscures, an official traffic sign, device, or signal;\n\n(2) Size of signs:\n\n(a) The maximum area for any one sign shall be eight hundred square feet with a maximum height of thirty feet and a maximum length of seventy-two feet, inclusive of border and trim but excluding the base or apron, supports, and other structural members. The area shall be measured as established herein and in rules promulgated by the commission. In determining the size of a conforming or nonconforming sign structure, temporary cutouts and extensions installed for the length of a specific display contract shall not be considered a substantial increase to the size of the permanent display; provided the actual square footage of such temporary cutouts or extensions may not exceed thirty-three percent of the permanent display area. Signs erected in accordance with the provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600 prior to August 28, 2002, which fail to meet the requirements of this provision shall be deemed legally nonconforming as defined herein;\n\n(b) The maximum size limitations shall apply to each side of a sign structure, and signs may be placed back to back, double faced, or in V-type construction with not more than two displays to each facing, but such sign structure shall be considered as one sign;\n\n(c) After August 28, 1999, no new sign structure shall be erected in which two or more displays are stacked one above the other. Stacked structures existing on or before August 28, 1999, in accordance with sections 226.500 to 226.600 shall be deemed legally nonconforming and may be maintained in accordance with the provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600.

No sign structure shall be erected within one thousand four hundred feet of an existing sign on the same side of the highway;\n\nb. Outside of incorporated municipalities, no structure may be located adjacent to or within five hundred feet of an interchange, intersection at grade, or safety rest area. Such five hundred feet shall be measured from the beginning or ending of the pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the main traveled way. For purpose of this subparagraph, the term\"incorporated municipalities\"shall include \"urban areas\", except that such\"urban areas\"shall not be considered \"incorporated municipalities\" if it is finally determined that such would have the effect of making Missouri be in noncompliance with the requirements of Title 23, United States Code, Section 131;\n\n(b) The spacing between structure provisions of this subdivision do not apply to signs which are separated by buildings, natural surroundings, or other obstructions in such manner that only one sign facing located within such distance is visible at any one time.

All measurements shall be from the outer edges of the regularly used improvements, buildings, parking lots, landscaped, storage or processing areas of the commercial or industrial activity and along and parallel to the edge of the pavement of the highway. Unzoned land shall not include:\n\n(a) Land on the opposite side of the highway from an unzoned commercial or industrial area as defined in this section and located adjacent to highways located on the interstate, federal-aid primary system as it existed on June 1, 1991, or the national highway system as amended, unless the opposite side of the highway qualifies as a separate unzoned commercial or industrial area; or\n\n(b) Land zoned by a state or local law, regulation, or ordinance;\n\n(5)\"Commercial or industrial activities\"as used in this section means those which are generally recognized as commercial or industrial by zoning authorities in this state, except that none of the following shall be considered commercial or industrial:\n\n(a) Outdoor advertising structures;\n\n(b) Agricultural, forestry, ranching, grazing, farming, and related activities, including seasonal roadside fresh produce stands;\n\n(c) Transient or temporary activities;\n\n(d) Activities more than six hundred sixty feet from the nearest edge of the right-of-way or not visible from the main traveled way;\n\n(e) Activities conducted in a building principally used as a residence;\n\n(f) Railroad tracks and minor sidings;\n\n(6) The words\"unzoned commercial or industrial land\"shall also include all areas not specified in this section which constitute an \"unzoned commercial or industrial area\" within the meaning of the present Section 131 of Title 23 of the United States Code, or as such statute may be amended. As used in this section, the words\"zoned commercial or industrial area\"shall refer to those areas zoned commercial or industrial by the duly constituted zoning authority of a municipality, county, or other lawfully established political subdivision of the state, or by the state and which is within seven hundred fifty feet of one or more permanent commercial or industrial activities. Commercial or industrial activities as used in this section are limited to those activities:\n\n(a) In which the primary use of the property is commercial or industrial in nature;\n\n(b) Which are clearly visible from the highway and recognizable as a commercial business;\n\n(c) Which are permanent as opposed to temporary or transitory and of a nature that would customarily be restricted to commercial or industrial zoning in areas comprehensively zoned; and\n\n(d) In determining whether the primary use of the property is commercial or industrial pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the state highways and transportation commission shall consider the following factors:\n\na. The presence of a permanent and substantial building;\n\nb. The existence of utilities and local business licenses, if any, for the commercial activity;\n\nc. On-premise signs or other identification;\n\nd. The presence of an owner or employee on the premises for at least twenty hours per week;\n\n(7) In zoned commercial and industrial areas, whenever a state, county or municipal zoning authority has adopted laws or ordinances which include regulations with respect to the size, lighting and spacing of signs, which regulations are consistent with the intent of sections 226.500 to 226.600 and with customary use, then from and after the effective date of such regulations, and so long as they shall continue in effect, the provisions of this section shall not apply to the erection of signs in such areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, after August 28, 1992, with respect to any outdoor advertising which is regulated by the provisions of subdivision (1), (3) or (4) of section 226.520 or subsection 1 of section 226.527:\n\n(a) No county or municipality shall issue a permit to allow a regulated sign to be newly erected without a permit issued by the state highways and transportation commission;\n\n(b) A county or municipality may charge a reasonable one-time permit or inspection fee to assure compliance with local wind load and electrical requirements when the sign is first erected, but a county or municipality may not charge a permit or inspection fee for such sign after such initial fee. Changing the display face or performing routine maintenance shall not be considered as erecting a new sign;\n\n(8) The state highways and transportation commission on behalf of the state of Missouri, may seek agreement with the Secretary of Transportation of the United States under Section 131 of Title 23, United States Code, as amended, that sections 226.500 to 226.600 are in conformance with that Section 131 and provides effective control of outdoor advertising signs as set forth therein. If such agreement cannot be reached and the penalties under subsection (b) of Section 131 are invoked, the attorney general of this state shall institute proceedings described in subsection (1) of that Section 131.\n\n(L. 1965 2d Ex.

Conforming out of standard signs treated as conforming, when — definitions — duties of owners — local zoning authorities may prohibit resetting of signs — inspections. —1. As used in this section, the following words or phrases mean:\n\n(1)\"Conforming out of standard signs\", signs that fail to meet the current statutory and administrative rule requirements for outdoor advertising but currently comply with the terms of the federal/state agreement and meet the August 27, 1999, statutory and administrative rule requirements that governed outdoor advertising and the Highway Beautification Act of 1965;\n\n(2)\"Federal/state agreement\", an agreement executed between the United States Department of Transportation and the state highways and transportation commission on February 22, 1972, for carrying out national policy relative to control of outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to the national system of interstate and defense highways and the federal-aid primary system;\n\n(3)\"Qualifying signs\", signs which meet the requirements for outdoor advertising in effect on August 27, 1999, and the requirements of the federal/state agreement;\n\n(4)\"Reset\", movement of a sign structure from one location to another location on the same or adjoining property, if the adjoining property is zoned commercial or industrial or in an unzoned commercial or industrial area and the owner of the sign has obtained the legal right to erect a sign on the adjoining property from its owner, as authorized by a sign permit amendment and the terms of an executed written partial waiver and reset agreement between the permit owner and the state highways and transportation commission;\n\n(5)\"Substantially rebuilt\", any reconstruction or repair of a sign that requires the replacement of more than fifty percent of the sign structure's support poles in a twelve-month period.\n\n2. Subject to the provisions of this section, and if allowed by applicable local regulations, conforming out of standard signs shall be treated as conforming signs under commission administrative rules, including new display technologies, lighting, cutouts, and extensions, except that such signs shall not be substantially rebuilt except in accordance with the provisions of this section. If allowed by applicable local regulations, new technologies, lighting, cutouts, and extensions may be utilized on conforming and conforming out of standard signs in accordance with Missouri department of transportation regulations.\n\n3. If allowed by applicable local regulations, a conforming out of standard sign may be upgraded:\n\n(1) Up to twenty percent of the sign face, not to exceed one hundred sixty square feet of area, with digital technology for displaying text or numbers in accordance with current law and rules; or\n\n(2) More than twenty percent only if it maintains a distance of at least one thousand four hundred feet from any other such digital technology display sign.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, a conforming out of standard sign may be unstacked by closing the gap between the signs or by replacing the faces with one display area. The resulting sign face square footage shall not exceed the square footage of the original stacked structure. A conforming out of standard sign structure height may be lowered.\n\n5. On the date the commission approves funding for any phase or portion of construction or reconstruction of any street or highway, the rules in effect for outdoor advertising on August 27, 1999, shall be reinstated for that section of highway scheduled for construction and there shall immediately be a moratorium imposed on the issuance of state sign permits for new sign structures.\n\n6. Owners of existing signs which meet the requirements for outdoor advertising in effect on August 27, 1999, and the requirements of the federal/state agreement and who voluntarily execute a partial waiver and reset agreement may reset such signs on the same or adjoining property. Such reset agreements shall be contingent upon obtaining any required local approval to reset the sign structure. Any sign which has been reset must still comply with the August 27, 1999, outdoor advertising regulations after it has been reset.\n\n7. Owners of existing signs who elect to reset qualifying signs shall receive compensation from the state highways and transportation commission or in accordance with a cost sharing agreement representing the actual cost to reset the existing sign. Signs which have been reset under these provisions must be reconstructed of the same type materials and may not exceed the square footage of the original sign structure.\n\n8. Sign owners may elect to reset existing qualifying signs by executing a partial waiver and reset agreement with the commission. Such agreement shall specify the size, type, and location of the rebuilt sign and the reset expenses to be paid to the owner by the commission. The commission may consider the impact of a potential reset upon scenic, natural, historic, or other features in the surrounding area in its determination of whether to enter into a reset agreement.\n\n9. Immediately upon the completion of construction on any section of highway, the moratorium on new permits shall be lifted and the rules for outdoor advertising in effect on the date the construction is completed shall apply to such section of highway.\n\n10. Local zoning authorities may prohibit the resetting of qualifying signs which fail to comply with local regulations.\n\n11. The state highways and transportation commission, in accordance with section 226.500, shall review its current rules and regulations and solicit industry, stakeholder, and public comments regarding digital technology upgrades, including but not limited to, ad copy duration, distance from interchanges, brightness controls, including light sensors and timers, and distance from other billboards prior to implementing the sign reset agreement program or digital upgrade regulations described in this section.\n\n12.

Unlawful signs defined — removal authorized — notice — owner may proceed, how — removal costs, how paid — review of order, how — order of removal — reimbursement to owner, when. —1. The following outdoor advertising within six hundred sixty feet of the right-of-way of interstate or primary highways is deemed unlawful and shall be subject to removal:\n\n(1) Signs erected after March 30, 1972, contrary to the provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600 and signs erected on or after January 1, 1968, but before March 30, 1972, contrary to the sizing, spacing, lighting, or location provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600 as they appeared in the revised statutes of Missouri 1969; or\n\n(2) Signs for which a permit is not obtained or a biennial inspection fee is more than twelve months past due; or\n\n(3) Signs which are obsolete. Signs shall not be considered obsolete solely because they temporarily do not carry an advertising message; or\n\n(4) Signs that are not in good repair; or\n\n(5) Signs not securely affixed to a substantial structure; or\n\n(6) Signs which attempt or appear to attempt to regulate, warn, or direct the movement of traffic or which interfere with, imitate, or resemble any official traffic sign, signal, or device; or\n\n(7) Signs which are erected or maintained upon trees or painted or drawn upon rocks or other natural features.\n\n2. Signs erected after August 13, 1976, beyond six hundred sixty feet of the right-of-way outside of urban areas, visible from the main traveled way of the interstate or primary system and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such traveled way, except those signs described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 226.520 are deemed unlawful and shall be subject to removal.\n\n3. If a sign is deemed to be unlawful for any of the reasons set out in subsections 1 to 7 of this section, the state highways and transportation commission shall give notice either by certified mail or by personal service to the owner or occupant of the land on which advertising believed to be unlawful is located and the owner of the outdoor advertising structure. Such notice shall specify the basis for the alleged unlawfulness, shall specify the remedial action which is required to correct the unlawfulness and shall advise that a failure to take the remedial action within sixty days will result in the sign being removed. Within sixty days after receipt of the notice as to him, the owner of the land or of the structure may remove the sign or may take the remedial action specified or may file an action for administrative review pursuant to the provisions of sections 536.067 to 536.090 to review the action of the state highways and transportation commission, or he may proceed under the provisions of section 536.150 as if the act of the highways and transportation commission was one not subject to administrative review. Notwithstanding any other provisions of sections 226.500 to 226.600, no outdoor advertising structure erected prior to August 28, 1992, defined as a \"structure lawfully in existence\" or \"lawfully existing\", by subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of subsection 3*of section 226.550, shall be removed for failure to have a permit until a notice, as provided in this section, has been issued which shall specify failure to obtain a permit or pay a biennial inspection fee as the basis for alleged unlawfulness, and shall advise that failure to take the remedial action of applying for a permit or paying the inspection fee within sixty days will result in the sign being removed. Signs for which biennial inspection fees are delinquent shall not be removed unless the fees are more than twelve months past due and actual notice of the delinquency has been provided to the sign owner. Upon application made within the sixty-day period as provided in this section, and accompanied by the fee prescribed by section 226.550, together with any inspection fees that would have been payable if a permit had been timely issued, the state highways and transportation commission shall issue a one-time permanent permit for such sign. Such signs with respect to which permits are so issued are hereby determined by the state of Missouri to have been lawfully erected within the meaning of \"lawfully erected\" as that term is used in Title 23, United States Code, Section 131(g), as amended, and shall only be removed upon payment of just compensation, except that the issuance of permits shall not entitle the owners of such signs to compensation for their removal if it is finally determined that such signs are not \"lawfully erected\" as that term is used in Section 131(g) of Title 23 of the United States Code.\n\n4. If actual notice as provided in this section is given and neither the remedial action specified is taken nor an action for review is filed, or if an action for review is filed and is finally adjudicated in favor of the state highways and transportation commission, the state highways and transportation commission shall have authority to immediately remove the unlawful outdoor advertising. The owner of the structure shall be liable for the costs of such removal. The commission shall incur no liability for causing this removal, except for damage caused by negligence of the commission, its agents or employees.\n\n5. If notice as provided in this section is given and an action for review is filed under the provisions of section 536.150, or if administrative review pursuant to the provisions of sections 536.067 to 536.090 is filed and the state highways and transportation commission enters its final decision and order to remove the outdoor advertising structure, the advertising message contained on the structure shall be removed or concealed by the owner of the structure, at the owner's expense, until the action for judicial review is finally adjudicated. If the owner of the structure refuses or fails to remove or conceal the advertising message, the commission may remove or conceal the advertising message and the owner of the structure shall be liable for the costs of such removal or concealment. The commission shall incur no liability for causing the removal or concealment of the advertising message while an action for review is pending, except if the owner finally prevails in its action for judicial review, the commission will compensate the owner at the rate the owner is actually receiving income from the advertiser pursuant to written lease from the time the message is removed until the judicial review is final.\n\n6. Any signs advertising tourist-oriented type business will be the last to be removed.\n\n7. Any signs prohibited by section 226.527 which were lawfully erected prior to August 13, 1976, shall be removed pursuant to section 226.570.\n\n8. The transportation department shall reimburse to the lawful owners of any said nonconforming signs that are now in existence as defined in sections 226.540, 226.550, 226.580 and 226.585, said compensation calculated and/or based on a fair market value and not mere replacement cost.\n\n(L. 1965 2d Ex.
