The purposes of the compact do not include lobbying activities against user fees for barge traffic and such activities under this compact are prohibited.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the four states to accomplish the purposes in Article I through the official in each state who is charged with the duty of administering the public waters and to collect and correlate through those officials the data necessary for the proper administration of the compact. Those officials may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations to accomplish the purposes of this compact.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThe states of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska agree that within a reasonable time they shall fulfill the obligations of this compact and that each shall authorize the proper official or agency in its state to take the necessary steps to promote the use of barges and develop the Missouri River as it flows between and within the compact states for greater amounts of barge traffic.\n\nThis compact does not limit the powers granted in any other act to enter into interstate or other agreements relating to the Missouri River flowing between and within the compact states, alter the relations between the respective internal responsibilities of the government of a party state and its subdivisions, or impair or affect any rights, powers, or jurisdiction of the United States, or those acting by or under its authority, in, over, and to those waters of the Missouri River. The adoption of this compact by the general assembly shall not require the state of Missouri to adopt any legislation or to appropriate funds for its implementation.\n\nUnless this compact is entered into on or before July 1, 1984, the governor shall take no further action to secure the compact.\n\n(L. 1983 H.B. 102 § 1)",
