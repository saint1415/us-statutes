Notwithstanding any provision of section 227.100 to the contrary, as an alternative to the requirements and procedures specified by sections 227.040 to 227.100, the state highways and transportation commission is authorized to enter into highway design-build project contracts. The total number of highway design-build project contracts awarded by the commission in any state fiscal year shall not exceed two percent of the total number of all state highway system projects awarded to contracts for construction from projects listed in the commission's approved statewide transportation improvement project for that state fiscal year.\n\n2. Notwithstanding provisions of subsection 1 of this section to the contrary, the state highways and transportation commission is authorized to enter into additional design-build contracts for the design, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of Missouri Route 364 as contained in any county with a charter form of government and with more than two hundred fifty thousand but fewer than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants and in any county with a charter form of government and with more than one million inhabitants, and the State Highway 169 and 96th Street intersection located within a home rule city with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants and located in more than one county. The state highways and transportation commission is authorized to enter into an additional design-build contract for the design, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of State Highway 92, contained in a county of the first classification with more than one hundred eighty-four thousand but fewer than one hundred eighty-eight thousand inhabitants, from its intersection with State Highway 169, east to its intersection with State Highway E. The state highways and transportation commission is authorized to enter into an additional design-build contract for the design, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of US 40/61 I-64 Missouri River Bridge as contained in any county with a charter form of government and with more than one million inhabitants and any county with a charter form of government and with more than two hundred fifty thousand but fewer than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\n3. For the purpose of this section a\"design-builder\"is defined as an individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity, including combinations of such entities making a proposal to perform or performing a design-build highway project contract.\n\n4. For the purpose of this section,\"design-build highway project contract\"is defined as the procurement of all materials and services necessary for the design, construction, reconstruction or improvement of a state highway project in a single contract with a design-builder capable of providing the necessary materials and services.\n\n5. For the purpose of this section,\"highway project\"is defined as the design, construction, reconstruction or improvement of highways or bridges under contract with the state highways and transportation commission, which is funded by state, federal or local funds or any combination of such funds.\n\n6. In using a design-build highway project contract, the commission shall establish a written procedure by rule for prequalifying design-builders before such design-builders will be allowed to make a proposal on the project.\n\n7. In any design-build highway project contract, whether involving state or federal funds, the commission shall require that each person submitting a request for qualifications provide a detailed disadvantaged business enterprise participation plan. The plan shall provide information describing the experience of the person in meeting disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals, how the person will meet the department of transportation's disadvantaged business enterprise participation goal and such other qualifications that the commission considers to be in the best interest of the state.\n\n8. The commission is authorized to issue a request for proposals to a maximum of five design-builders prequalified in accordance with subsection 6 of this section.\n\n9. The commission may require approval of any person performing subcontract work on the design-build highway project.\n\n10. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 107.170, and 227.100, to the contrary, the commission shall require the design-builder to provide to the commission directly such bid, performance and payment bonds, or such letters of credit, in such terms, durations, amounts, and on such forms as the commission may determine to be adequate for its protection and provided by a surety or sureties authorized to conduct surety business in the state of Missouri or a federally insured financial institution or institutions, satisfactory to the commission, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) A bid or proposal bond, cash or a certified or cashier's check;\n\n(2) A performance bond or bonds for the construction period specified in the design-build highway project contract equal to a reasonable estimate of the total cost of construction work under the terms of the design-build highway project contract. If the commission determines in writing supported by specific findings that the reasonable estimate of the total cost of construction work under the terms of the design-build highway project contract is expected to exceed two-hundred fifty million dollars and a performance bond or bonds in such amount is impractical, the commission shall set the performance bond or bonds at the largest amount reasonably available, but not less than two-hundred fifty million dollars, and may require additional security, including but not limited to letters of credit, for the balance of the estimate not covered by the performance bond or bonds;\n\n(3) A payment bond or bonds that shall be enforceable under section 522.300 for the protection of persons supplying labor and material in carrying out the construction work provided for in the design-build highway project contract. The aggregate amount of the payment bond or bonds shall equal a reasonable estimate of the total amount payable for the cost of construction work under the terms of the design-build highway project contract unless the commission determines in writing supported by specific findings that a payment bond or bonds in such amount is impractical, in which case the commission shall establish the amount of the payment bond or bonds; except that the amount of the payment bond or bonds shall not be less than the aggregate amount of the performance bond or bonds and any additional security to such performance bond or bonds; and\n\n(4) Upon award of the design-build highway project contract, the sum of the performance bond and any required additional security established under subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection shall be stated, and shall be a matter of public record.\n\n11. The commission is authorized to prescribe the form of the contracts for the work.\n\n12. The commission is empowered to make all final decisions concerning the performance of the work under the design-build highway project contract, including claims for additional time and compensation.\n\n13. The provisions of sections 8.285 to 8.291 shall not apply to the procurement of architectural, engineering or land surveying services for the design-build highway project, except that any person providing architectural, engineering or land surveying services for the design-builder on the design-build highway project must be licensed in Missouri to provide such services.\n\n14. The commission shall pay a reasonable stipend to prequalified responsive design-builders who submit a proposal, but are not awarded the design-build highway project.\n\n15. The commission shall comply with the provisions of any act of congress or any regulations of any federal administrative agency which provides and authorizes the use of federal funds for highway projects using the design-build process.\n\n16. The commission shall promulgate administrative rules to implement this section or to secure federal funds. Such rules shall be published for comment in the Missouri Register and shall include prequalification criteria, the make-up of the prequalification review team, specifications for the design criteria package, the method of advertising, receiving and evaluating proposals from design-builders, the criteria for awarding the design-build highway project based on the design criteria package and a separate proposal stating the cost of construction, and other methods, procedures and criteria necessary to administer this section.\n\n17. The commission shall make a status report to the members of the general assembly and the governor following the award of the design-build project, as an individual component of the annual report submitted by the commission to the joint transportation oversight committee in accordance with the provisions of section 21.795. The annual report prior to advertisement of the design-build highway project contracts shall state the goals of the project in reducing costs and/or the time of completion for the project in comparison to the design-bid-build method of construction and objective measurements to be utilized in determining achievement of such goals. Subsequent annual reports shall include: the time estimated for design and construction of different phases or segments of the project and the actual time required to complete such work during the period; the amount of each progress payment to the design-builder during the period and the percentage and a description of the portion of the project completed regarding such payment; the number and a description of design change orders issued during the period and the cost of each such change order; upon substantial and final completion, the total cost of the design-build highway project with a breakdown of costs for design and construction; and such other measurements as specified by rule. The annual report immediately after final completion of the project shall state an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the design-build method of contracting for highway and bridge projects in comparison to the design-bid-build method of contracting and an assessment of whether the goals of the project in reducing costs and/or the time of completion of the project were met.\n\n18. The commission shall give public notice of a request for qualifications in at least two public newspapers that are distributed wholly or in part in this state and at least one construction industry trade publication that is distributed nationally.\n\n19. The commission shall publish its cost estimates of the design-build highway project award and the project completion date along with its public notice of a request for qualifications of the design-build project.\n\n20. If the commission fails to receive at least two responsive submissions from design-builders considered qualified, submissions shall not be opened and it shall readvertise the project.\n\n21. For any highway design-build project constructed under this section, the commission shall negotiate and reach agreements with affected railroads. Such agreements shall include clearance, safety, insurance, and indemnification provisions, but are not required to include provisions on right-of-way acquisitions.\n\n(L. 2002 H.B. 1196, A.L. 2007 1st Ex.

Within one hundred twenty days of receiving written notice of approval of the utility plan of adjustment from the commission, the owner shall provide the commission with a relocation plan. The one hundred twenty-day clock stops after the relocation plan is submitted by the owner. If, after timely submission of the relocation plan by the owner, revisions or alterations are necessary for any reason, or if the original relocation plan was incomplete due to information needed from other parties, the one hundred twenty-day clock begins to run again when the needed information is received back by the owner.\n\n2. The relocation plan shall include a narrative description of work that will be done in relocating the owner's utility facilities and whether the work or a portion of the work must be coordinated with or is contingent upon work being performed by another utility facility owner or the contractor to the commission. The relocation plan shall list, if applicable, any anticipated issues or problems related to the acquisition of right-of-way. The relocation plan shall, if applicable, detail the anticipated number of days to acquire additional easements not provided within the new highway right-of-way. The relocation plan shall also give estimates as to the time needed to obtain any necessary customer approvals for cut-over dates, if necessary. The relocation plan shall state when the work will be started and the length of time in days estimated to complete the work. It is permissible for an owner to state in a relocation plan that the owner's work will be completed within a stated number of days from the date that a contractor or another owner completes certain identified work which interferes with the owner's work. The relocation plan shall identify any contingencies, if applicable, that may impact the anticipated start of relocation. The relocation plan shall also describe whether the plan is incomplete due to:\n\n(1) Other owners failing to coordinate their plans with the owner submitting the plan;\n\n(2) Other owners failing to provide information necessary to submit a complete relocation plan;\n\n(3) The commission failing to provide any information required by subsection 2 of section 227.554; or\n\n(4) Any other reason explained in the plan regarding the circumstances and cause of the plan being incomplete.\n\n3. The commission shall review the relocation plan to ensure compatibility with permit requirements, the project plan, and the anticipated letting date and notice to proceed for the project. If utility relocation is dependent upon or must be coordinated with work to be completed by the contractor, the relocation plan shall assure timely completion of the project. If the relocation plan is acceptable to the commission, the commission shall notify the owner in writing within thirty days of receiving the plan. If the relocation plan submitted by the owner is not compatible, reasonable, or does not allow timely completion of the project, the commission shall advise the owner in writing as soon as practicable, but not later than thirty days after receiving the relocation plan. The commission shall specify in the notice which parts of the relocation plan it finds objectionable, and the reasons for its conclusions. The owner shall submit a revised relocation plan within thirty calendar days after receipt of notice by the commission that the relocation plan is not acceptable. The commission shall review the revised relocation plan, and if the relocation plan is still not acceptable, the commission shall provide a relocation plan to the owner. The owner shall not be bound by the terms of the commission's relocation plan if such relocation plan:\n\n(1) Requires the payment of overtime to employees to expedite the construction project; or\n\n(2) Requires the owner to comply with a deadline which is not feasible due, in whole or in part, to one or more factors outside the control of the owner.\n\n4. If the owner informs the commission, in writing, or the commission determines that the owner's relocation work is dependent upon or must be coordinated with work being performed by the commission's contractor, the commission shall convene a meeting of the contractor and the one or more owners whose relocation work is dependent upon or must be coordinated with the contractor's work. Such meeting shall be held after the letting date at which bids were received for the construction project, but prior to the issuance of a notice to proceed to the commission's contractor. After such meeting, and before or concurrent with the issuance of a notice to proceed, the commission shall provide a schedule for the relocation of utilities to the owner and the commission's contractor. If the approved relocation plan, or a portion of such plan, is dependent upon or must be coordinated with work to be performed by the contractor, the contractor shall notify the commission of its best estimate of the date that all construction necessary for the relocation of utilities will be completed, at least fourteen days prior to such date. If such completion date is delayed due to weather or other causes, the contractor shall immediately notify the commission of the delay and the revised expected completion date. The contractor shall give a second notice to the commission five days prior to the date work will be completed as necessary for relocation work to begin. It shall be the responsibility of the commission to notify the owner or owners of the contractor's estimated completion dates. The contractor may also notify the owner directly of such dates, if the contractor has received information from the owner under subsection 7 of this section, but such notice shall not relieve the commission of its obligation to notify the owner. If the contractor's delay causes additional delay by the owner, the commission and the owner shall negotiate in good faith to determine the new completion date.\n\n5. (1) The commission shall notify the owner in writing not less than thirty days before the owner is required to begin relocation provided for in the approved relocation plan. Unless the owner has encountered excusable delay as set forth in subsection 4 of section 227.558, the owner shall complete its work within the time frame described in the relocation plan, and shall complete all work that can be done prior to construction before the issuance of the notice to proceed, including work that may need to be coordinated with other utility owners but is not dependent on the work of the contractor.\n\n(2) The notice required by subdivision (1) of this subsection shall include the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the commission's contractor and any subcontractors performing work on the construction project. Such information shall also include the name and title of an individual employed by the contractor or subcontractor having primary responsibility for the construction project. Within fifteen days of receiving notice, the owner shall provide to the commission and the commission's contractor the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the employee of the owner who is responsible for implementation of the owner's relocation plan and the same information for any utility contractor to the owner for purposes of carrying out the relocation plan.\n\n6. The owner shall notify the commission when relocation work has started. During the course of the relocation work, the commission may require owners to provide progress reports until its relocation is completed. The owner shall notify the commission when all relocation work is complete. All notices of either starting or completion of relocation work and all monthly progress reports shall be provided within five days after such dates.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 209 § 227.245)\n\nEffective 1-01-06",

Collection of user fees — notice of tolls — penalty — admissibility of reports and telephone calls — toll collection and traffic citation procedures. —1. The private partner may use any method for collecting and enforcing user fees for the use of the project which may include, but is*not limited to, toll tickets, barrier toll facilities, billing accounts, commuter passes, and electronic recording or identification devices. The display of a recording or identification device issued or authorized by the private partner for such purposes on or near the windshield of a motor vehicle shall not be a violation of any law or rule in the state of Missouri unless the device is attached in a manner that obstructs the operator's clear view of the project.\n\n2. The private partner operating the project as a toll facility shall post notice on or around such facility in the plain view of operators of motor vehicles using such facility which reads as follows:\n\n\"NOTICE: FAILURE TO PAY THE REQUIRED TOLL IS A TRAFFIC VIOLATION. TOLL BOOTH OPERATORS WILL REPORT ANY FAILURE TO PAY REQUIRED TOLLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO WILL ISSUE A TRAFFIC CITATION.\".\n\n3. The owner of a motor vehicle involved in a violation for failure to pay the required toll is guilty of an infraction and upon conviction shall be required to pay the amount of the toll that was the subject of the violation which shall be remitted to the private partner and a fine in an amount not to exceed two hundred dollars.\n\n4. A written report or telephone call from a toll enforcement officer, law enforcement officer, or photo monitoring system evidence that indicates a required toll was not paid is admissible in any proceeding to enforce this section, subject to foundation evidence to establish the authenticity of the report, call, or photographs. Photo monitoring system evidence that shows the motor vehicle, whether operated by the owner or another operator, has failed to pay a toll shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the motor vehicle shown in the photographic evidence was used to commit a violation of this section. If charges are filed against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one of the owners shall be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one of the owners. If the motor vehicle involved in the violation is registered in the name of a rental or leasing company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing law enforcement or the prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time of the violation. No prosecuting authority shall bring any legal proceeding against a rental or leasing company under this section unless prior written notice of the violation has been given to such rental or leasing company by registered mail at the address appearing on the motor vehicle's registration and the rental or leasing company has failed to provide the rental or leasing agreement copy within fifteen days of receipt of such notice.\n\n5. The following procedures shall be taken for the enforcement of toll collections and issuance of traffic citations under this section:\n\n(1) Any toll booth operator witnessing a failure to pay a required toll in violation of this section shall report such violation to a law enforcement officer or agency. The report may be in one of the following forms:\n\n(a) A telephone call from a toll enforcement officer to a law enforcement agency indicating a violation and a reasonable description of the motor vehicle violating the toll enforcement provisions of this section, including but not limited to the license plate number, make, model, and color of the motor vehicle;\n\n(b) A certificate or a written report sworn to or affirmed by a toll enforcement officer, agent, private partner, Missouri state highway patrol officer, city police officer, or a sheriff's department deputy which alleges that a violation of this section occurred, or a facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images produced by a photo monitoring system or a photograph from a photo monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, subject to foundation evidence to establish the authenticity of such photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images produced by a photo monitoring system, and shall be admissible in any proceeding charging a violation of the toll collection provisions in this section; provided that, any photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection and admission into evidence in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation;\n\n(2) After a report has been provided to a Missouri law enforcement agency, such agency is authorized to issue a traffic citation for failure to pay the required toll;\n\n(3) The law enforcement agency responsible for the issuance of a traffic citation for failure to pay a toll is responsible for prosecution of such citation.\n\n­­The provisions of this section shall not prohibit a law enforcement officer from issuing a citation for a violation of any other traffic laws and regulations on the project.\n\n(L. 2006 H.B. 1380)\n\n*Word \"are\" appears in original rolls.",
