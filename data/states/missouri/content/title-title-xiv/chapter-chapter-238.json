Compact between Missouri and Kansas — powers and duties of authority. —Within sixty days after October 13, 1965, the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint three commissioners to enter into a compact on behalf of the state of Missouri with the state of Kansas. If the senate is not in session at the time for making any appointment, the governor shall make a temporary appointment as in case of a vacancy. Any two of the commissioners so appointed, together with the attorney general of the state of Missouri, may act to enter into the following compact:\n\nCOMPACT BETWEEN MISSOURI AND KANSAS CREATING THE KANSAS CITY AREA TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT AND THE KANSAS CITY AREA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY.\n\nThe States of Missouri and Kansas solemnly agree:\n\nThey agree to and pledge, each to the other, faithful cooperation in the future planning and development of the Kansas City Area Transportation District, holding in high trust for the benefit of its people and of the Nation, the special blessings and natural advantages thereof.\n\nTo that end, the two States create a district to be known as the Kansas City Area Transportation District (hereinafter referred to as \"The District\" ), which shall embrace the following territory: The Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte in Missouri, and the Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte in Kansas.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThere is created the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority of the Kansas City Area Transportation District (hereinafter referred to as the \"Authority\" ), which shall be a body corporate and politic and a political subdivision of the States of Missouri and Kansas.\n\nThe Authority shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) To acquire by gift, purchase or lease and to plan, construct, operate and maintain, or to lease to others for operation and maintenance, passenger transportation systems and facilities, either upon, above or below the ground.\n\n(2) To charge and collect fees and rents for use of the facilities owned or operated by it.\n\n(3) To contract and to be contracted with, and to sue and to be sued.\n\n(4) To receive for its lawful activities any contributions or moneys appropriated by municipalities, counties, or by the Federal Government or any agency or officer thereof or from any other source.\n\n(5) To disburse funds for its lawful activities and fix salaries and wages of its officers and employees.\n\n(6) To borrow money for the acquisition, planning, construction, equipping, operation, maintenance, repair, extension, and improvement of any facility which it has the power to own or to operate or to own and to operate, and to issue the negotiable notes, bonds or other instruments in writing of the Authority in evidence of the sum or sums to be borrowed.\n\n(7) To issue negotiable refunding notes, bonds or other instruments in writing for the purpose of refunding, extending or unifying the whole or any part of its valid indebtedness from time to time outstanding, whether evidenced by notes, bonds, or other instruments in writing, which refunding notes, bonds or other instruments in writing shall not exceed in amount the principal of the outstanding indebtedness to be refunded and the accrued interest thereon to the date of such refunding.\n\n(8) To provide that all negotiable notes, bonds and other instruments in writing issued either pursuant to subdivision (6) or pursuant to subdivision (7) hereof shall be payable, both as to principal and interest, out of the revenues collected for the use of any facility or combination of facilities owned or operated or owned and operated by the Authority, or out of any other resources of the Authority, and may be further secured by a mortgage or deed of trust upon any property owned by the Authority. All notes, bonds or other instruments in writing issued by the Authority as herein provided shall mature in not to exceed thirty years from the date thereof, shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding six percent per annum, and shall be sold for not less than ninety-five percent of the par value thereof. The Authority shall have the power to prescribe the details of such notes, bonds or other instruments in writing, and of the issuance and sale thereof, and shall have the power to enter into covenants with the holders of such notes, bonds or other instruments in writing, not inconsistent with the powers herein granted to the Authority, without further legislative authority.\n\n(9) To condemn any and all rights or property, of any kind or character, necessary for the purposes of the Authority, subject, however, to the provisions of this compact; provided, however, that no property now or hereafter vested in or held by either State or by any county, city, village, township or other political subdivision, shall be taken by the Authority without the authority or consent of such state, county, city, village, township or other political subdivision. If the property to be condemned be situated in the State of Kansas, the said Authority shall follow the procedure of the Act of the State of Kansas providing for the exercise of the right of eminent domain, and if the property to be condemned be situated in the State of Missouri, the said Authority shall follow the procedure provided by the laws of the State of Missouri for the appropriation of land or other property taken for telegraph, telephone or railroad rights-of-way.\n\n(10) To petition any interstate commerce commission (or like body), public service commission, public utilities commission (or like body), or any other Federal, municipal, state or local authority, administrative, judicial or legislative, having jurisdiction in the premises, for the adoption of plans for and execution of any physical improvements, change in method, rate of transportation, which, in the opinion of the Authority, may be designed to improve or better the handling of commerce in and through the District, or improve terminal and transportation facilities therein. It may intervene in any proceeding affecting the commerce of the District.\n\n(11) To perform all other necessary and incidental functions; and to exercise such additional powers as shall be conferred on it by the Legislature of either State concurred in by the Legislature of the other and by Act of Congress.\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall impair the powers of any county, municipality or other political subdivision to acquire, own, operate, develop or improve any facility which the Authority is given the right and power to own, operate, develop or improve.\n\nNothing herein shall impair or invalidate in any way bonded indebtedness of either State or of any county, city, village, township or other political subdivision, nor impair the provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds of revenues derived from municipal property or dedicating the revenues derived from any municipal property to a specific purpose.\n\nUnless and until otherwise provided, the Authority shall make an annual report to the Governor of each State, setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact and any legislation thereunder.\n\nThe Authority shall consist of ten Commissioners, five of whom shall be resident voters of the State of Missouri and five of whom shall be resident voters of the State of Kansas.

The general assembly declares that:\n\n(1) The present and prospective traffic congestion and limited roadways in many areas of this state, and the limited availability of state funds, require as a public purpose the promotion and development of public transportation facilities and systems by new and alternative means;\n\n(2) The creation of transportation corporations by private parties in cooperation with the commission is essential to the continued economic growth of this state, is in the public interest, and will promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of this state by securing for them expanded and improved transportation facilities and systems;\n\n(3) The transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 will perform an essential function by acting to secure and obtain rights-of-way for urgently needed transportation systems and to assist in the planning and design of such systems;\n\n(4) The transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 will perform many functions normally undertaken by the commission and its staff, and thus will reduce the burdens and demands on limited funds available to the commission, thereby increasing the effectiveness and impact of those funds available to the commission;\n\n(5) The transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 will act in promoting and developing public transportation facilities and systems and in promoting economic development in this state, and will not act as the agent or instrumentality of any private interests even though many private interests may be benefitted by the transportation corporations, as will the general public. The transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 shall periodically make a showing to the state transportation department of a good faith effort of development and implementation of a women and minority employment and business plan. Only after such a showing of a good faith effort may the transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 waive the general policy of women and minority employment and business plan and involvement. If such policy is waived, the transportation corporations created under sections 238.300 to 238.360 shall make a showing of a good faith effort of development and implementation of a women and minority employment and business plan every three months until such policy is again in effect.\n\n2.

The sales tax imposed under the provisions of this section shall impose upon all sellers a tax for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling tangible personal property or rendering taxable services at retail to the extent and in the manner provided in sections 144.010 to 144.525 and the rules and regulations of the director of revenue issued pursuant thereto; except that the rate of the tax shall be the rate approved pursuant to this section. The amount reported and returned to the director of revenue by the seller shall be computed on the basis of the combined rate of the tax imposed by sections 144.010 to 144.525 and the tax imposed by this section, plus any amounts imposed under other provisions of law.\n\n6. After the effective date of any tax imposed under the provisions of this section, the director of revenue shall perform all functions incident to the administration, collection, enforcement, and operation of the tax, and the director of revenue shall collect in addition to the sales tax for the state of Missouri the additional tax authorized under the authority of this section. The tax imposed under this section and the tax imposed under the sales tax law of the state of Missouri shall be collected together and reported upon such forms and under such administrative rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the director of revenue. In order to permit sellers required to collect and report the sales tax to collect the amount required to be reported and remitted, but not to change the requirements of reporting or remitting tax or to serve as a levy of the tax, and in order to avoid fractions of pennies, the applicable provisions of section 144.285 shall apply to all taxable transactions.\n\n7. All applicable provisions contained in sections 144.010 to 144.525 governing the state sales tax and section 32.057, the uniform confidentiality provision, shall apply to the collection of the tax imposed by this section, except as modified in this section. All exemptions granted to agencies of government, organizations, persons and to the sale of certain articles and items of tangible personal property and taxable services under the provisions of sections 144.010 to 144.525 are hereby made applicable to the imposition and collection of the tax imposed by this section. The same sales tax permit, exemption certificate and retail certificate required by sections 144.010 to 144.525 for the administration and collection of the state sales tax shall satisfy the requirements of this section, and no additional permit or exemption certificate or retail certificate shall be required; except that the director of revenue may prescribe a form of exemption certificate for an exemption from the tax imposed by this section. All discounts allowed the retailer under the provisions of the state sales tax law for the collection of and for payment of taxes under chapter 144 are hereby allowed and made applicable to any taxes collected under the provisions of this section. The penalties provided in section 32.057 and sections 144.010 to 144.525 for a violation of those sections are hereby made applicable to violations of this section.\n\n8. For the purposes of a sales tax imposed pursuant to this section, all retail sales shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer, except for tangible personal property sold which is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination and except for the sale of motor vehicles, trailers, boats and outboard motors, which is provided for in subsection 12 of this section. In the event a retailer has more than one place of business in this state which participates in the sale, the sale shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer where the initial order for the tangible personal property is taken, even though the order must be forwarded elsewhere for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment or billing. A sale by a retailer's employee shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business from which he works.\n\n9. All sales taxes collected by the director of revenue under this section on behalf of any transit authority, less one percent for cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund after payment of premiums for surety bonds as provided in this section, shall be deposited in the state treasury in a special trust fund, which is hereby created, to be known as the \"County Transit Authority Sales Tax Trust Fund\". The moneys in the county transit authority sales tax trust fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the trust fund which was collected in each transit authority imposing a sales tax under this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of the county and the public. Not later than the tenth day of each month the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the trust fund during the preceding month to the transit authority which levied the tax.\n\n10. The director of revenue may authorize the state treasurer to make refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to any transit authority for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may authorize the state treasurer to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such transit authorities. If any transit authority abolishes the tax, the transit authority shall notify the director of revenue of the action at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the repeal and the director of revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such transit authority, the director of revenue shall authorize the state treasurer to remit the balance in the account to the transit authority and close the account of that transit authority. The director of revenue shall notify each transit authority of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the transit authority. The director of revenue shall annually report on his management of the trust fund and administration of the sales taxes authorized by this section. He shall provide each transit authority imposing the tax authorized by this section with a detailed accounting of the source of all funds received by him for the transit authority.\n\n11. The director of revenue and any of his deputies, assistants and employees who shall have any duties or responsibilities in connection with the collection, deposit, transfer, transmittal, disbursement, safekeeping, accounting, or recording of funds which come into the hands of the director of revenue under the provisions of this section shall enter a surety bond or bonds payable to any and all transit authorities in whose behalf such funds have been collected under this section in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars; but the director of revenue may enter into a blanket bond or bonds covering himself and all such deputies, assistants and employees. The cost of the premium or premiums for the surety bond or bonds shall be paid by the director of revenue from the share of the collection retained by the director of revenue for the benefit of the state.\n\n12. Sales taxes imposed pursuant to this section and use taxes on the purchase and sale of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors shall not be collected and remitted by the seller, but shall be collected by the director of revenue at the time application is made for a certificate of title, if the address of the applicant is within a county where a sales tax is imposed under this section. The amounts so collected, less the one percent collection cost, shall be deposited in the county transit authority sales tax trust fund. The purchase or sale of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors shall be deemed to be consummated at the address of the applicant. As used in this subsection, the term\"boat\"shall only include motorboats and vessels as the terms \"motorboat\" and \"vessel\" are defined in section 306.010.\n\n13. In any county where the transit authority sales tax has been imposed, if any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid by him under this section or in the event a determination has been made against him for taxes and penalty under this section, the limitation for bringing suit for the collection of the delinquent tax and penalty shall be the same as that provided in sections 144.010 to 144.525. Where the director of revenue has determined that suit must be filed against any person for the collection of delinquent taxes due the state under the state sales tax law, and where such person is also delinquent in payment of taxes under this section, the director of revenue shall notify the transit authority to which delinquent taxes are due under this section by United States registered mail or certified mail at least ten days before turning the case over to the attorney general. The transit authority, acting through its attorney, may join in such suit as a party plaintiff to seek a judgment for the delinquent taxes and penalty due such transit authority. In the event any person fails or refuses to pay the amount of any sales tax due under this section, the director of revenue shall promptly notify the transit authority to which the tax would be due so that appropriate action may be taken by the transit authority.\n\n14. Where property is seized by the director of revenue under the provisions of any law authorizing seizure of the property of a taxpayer who is delinquent in payment of the tax imposed by the state sales tax law, and where such taxpayer is also delinquent in payment of any tax imposed by this section, the director of revenue shall permit the transit authority to join in any sale of property to pay the delinquent taxes and penalties due the state and to the transit authority under this section. The proceeds from such sale shall first be applied to all sums due the state, and the remainder, if any, shall be applied to all sums due such transit authority under this section.\n\n15. The transit authority created under the provisions of sections 238.400 to 238.412 shall notify any and all affected businesses of the change in tax rate caused by the imposition of the tax authorized by sections 238.400 to 238.412.\n\n16. In the event that any transit authority in any county with a charter form of government and with more than two hundred fifty thousand but fewer than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants submits a proposal in any election to increase the sales tax under this section, and such proposal is approved by the voters, the county shall be reimbursed for the costs of submitting such proposal from the funds derived from the tax levied under this section.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 235 § 6, A.L. 2007 S.B. 30)",
