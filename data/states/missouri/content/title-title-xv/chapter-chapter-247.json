Territory included in district, contiguous — boundaries of districts, how changed — extension or enlargement of district, how. —1. Territory that may be included in a district sought to be incorporated or enlarged may be wholly within one or in more than one county, may take in school districts or parts thereof, and cities that do not have a waterworks system or cities whose governing body has by a majority vote requested that the city or part thereof be included within the boundaries of a public water supply district. For the purpose of this section,\"city\"means any city, town or village. The territory, however, shall be contiguous, and proceedings to incorporate shall be in the circuit court of the county in which the largest acreage is located. No two districts shall overlap.\n\n2. Any two or more contiguous districts or any city and a contiguous district may, if there are no outstanding general obligation bonds relating to drinking water supply projects in either entity, by a majority vote of the governing body of each entity, provide for territory located in one entity to be annexed and served by the entity contiguous to the annexed territory. Notice of the proposed annexation shall be filed with the circuit court that originally issued the decree of incorporation for a district which is detaching territory through the proposed annexation or with the circuit court that originally issued the decree of incorporation for a district which is including a city or part thereof through the proposed annexation. The court shall set a date for a hearing on the proposed annexation and shall cause notice to be published in the same manner as for the filing of the original petition for incorporation; except that publication of notice shall not be required if a majority of the landowners in the territory proposed to be annexed consent in writing, and if notice of the hearing is posted in three public places within the territory proposed to be annexed at least seven days before the date of the hearing. If publication of the notice is not required pursuant to this section, the court shall only approve the proposed annexation if there is sworn testimony by at least five landowners in the area of the proposed annexation, or a majority of the landowners, if there are fewer than ten landowners in the area. If the court, after the hearing, finds that the proposed annexation would not be in the public interest, it shall order that the annexation not be allowed. If the court finds the proposed annexation to be in the public interest, it shall approve the annexation and the territory shall be detached from the one entity and annexed to the other. After the annexation is approved, the circuit court in which each district involved in the proceedings was incorporated shall amend the decree of incorporation for each district to reflect the change in the boundaries as a result of the annexation and redivide each district into five subdistricts, fixing their boundary lines so that each of the five subdistricts have approximately the same area. A certified copy of the amended decree showing the boundary change and the new subdistricts shall be filed in the office of the recorder of deeds and in the office of the county clerk in each county having territory in the district and in the office of the secretary of state of the state of Missouri.\n\n3. The boundaries of any district may be extended or enlarged from time to time upon the filing, with the clerk of the circuit court having jurisdiction, of a petition by either:\n\n(1) The board of directors of the district and five or more voters or landowners within the territory proposed to be annexed by the district; or\n\n(2) The board of directors of the district and a majority of the landowners within the territory proposed to be annexed to the district.­­If the petition is filed by the board of directors of the district and five or more voters or landowners within the territory proposed to be annexed by the district, the same proceedings shall be followed as are provided in section 247.040 for the filing of a petition for the organization of the district, except that no election shall be held. Upon entry of a final order declaring the court's decree of annexation to be final and conclusive, the court shall modify or rearrange the boundary lines of the subdistricts as may be necessary or advisable. If the petition is filed by the board of directors of the district and a majority of the landowners within the territory proposed to be annexed, the publication of notice shall not be required, provided notice is posted in three public places within the territory proposed to be annexed at least seven days before the date of the hearing and provided that there is sworn testimony by at least five landowners in the territory proposed to be annexed, or a majority of the landowners if the total landowners in the area are fewer than ten. If the court finds that the annexation of such territory would be in the public interest, the court shall enter its order granting such annexation. Upon the entry of such order, the court shall modify or rearrange the boundary lines of the subdistricts as may be necessary or advisable.

Should any landowner who owns real estate that abuts upon a district once formed desire to have such real estate incorporated in the district, the landowner shall first petition the board of directors thereof for its approval. If such approval be granted, the clerk of the board shall endorse a certificate of the fact of approval by the board upon the petition. The petition so endorsed shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court in which the district is incorporated. It shall then be the duty of the court to amend the boundaries of such district by a decree incorporating the real estate in the same. A certified copy of this decree including the real estate in the district shall then be filed in the office of the recorder and in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real estate is located, and in the office of the secretary of state.

Territory included in a district that is not being served by such district may be detached from such district provided that there are no outstanding general obligation or special obligation bonds and no contractual obligations of greater than twenty-five thousand dollars for debt that pertains to infrastructure, fixed assets or obligations for the purchase of water. If any such bonds or debt is outstanding, and the written consent of the holders of such bonds or the creditors to such debt is obtained, then such territory may be detached in spite of the existence of such bonds or debt, except such consent shall not be required for special obligation bonds if the district has no water lines or other facilities located within any of the territory detached. Detachment may be made by the filing of a petition with the circuit court in which the district was incorporated. The petition shall contain a description of the tract to be detached and a statement that the detachment is in the best interest of the district or the inhabitants and property owners of the territory to be detached, together with the facts supporting such allegation. The petition may be submitted by the district acting through its board of directors, in which case the petition shall be signed by a majority of the board of directors of the district. The petition may also be submitted by voters residing in or by landowners owning land in the territory sought to be detached. If there are more than ten voters and landowners in such territory, the petition shall be signed by five or more voters or landowners within the territory; if there are less than ten voters and landowners within such territory, the petition shall be signed by fifty percent or more of the voters and landowners within the territory. In the event there are no voters living within such territory proposed to be detached, then the petition may be submitted by owners of more than fifty percent of the land in the territory proposed to be detached, in which case said petition shall be signed by the owners so submitting the petition. In the event the petition is not submitted by the district acting through its board of directors, the petitioner shall name the district as a defendant and serve a copy of the petition upon the district by certified or registered mail with a return receipt requested at least thirty-five days before the date of the hearing of the petition.\n\n2. Such petition shall be filed in the circuit court having jurisdiction and the court shall set a date for hearing on the proposed detachment and the clerk of the circuit court shall give notice of the filing of the petition and the hearing to the district by certified or registered mail with a return receipt requested if the district is not the petitioner, and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proceedings are pending and in a newspaper of general circulation in the territory proposed to be detached. Such notice shall be published in three consecutive issues of a weekly newspaper, or in lieu thereof, in twenty consecutive issues of a daily newspaper. The last insertion of the notice shall be made not less than seven nor more than twenty-one days before the hearing date. Such notice shall be substantially as follows:\n\n3. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the case or the hearing thereon from time to time until final disposition thereof.\n\n4. Exceptions or objections to the detachment of such territory may be made by any voter or landowner within the boundaries of the district, including the territory to be detached. In the event the petition is not submitted by the district acting through its board of directors, the district may file exceptions or objections. Exceptions or objections shall be in writing, shall specify the grounds upon which they are made, and shall be filed not later than five days before the date set for hearing the petition. In considering the petition for detachment, the court shall take into consideration the evidence in support of and opposition to the petition, including such exceptions and objections.

If the court approves the detachment, it shall make its order detaching the territory described in the petition from the remainder of the district, or in the event it shall find that only a portion of said territory should be detached, the court shall order such portion detached from the district. The court shall also make any changes in subdistrict boundary lines it deems necessary to meet the requirements of sections 247.010 to 247.220. Any subdistrict line changes shall not become effective until the next annual election of a member of the board of directors.\n\n6.

Proceedings for the formation of a public water supply district shall be substantially as follows: a petition in duplicate describing the proposed boundaries of the district sought to be formed, accompanied by a plat of the proposed district, shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county wherein the proposed district is situate, or with the clerk of the circuit court of the county having the largest acreage proposed to be included in the proposed district, in the event that the proposed district embraces lands in more than one county. Such petition, in addition to such boundary description, shall set forth an estimate of the number of customers of the proposed district, the necessity for the formation of the district, the probable cost of the improvement, an approximation of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the district and such other information as may be useful to the court in determining whether or not the petition should be granted and a decree of incorporation entered. Such petition shall be accompanied by a cash deposit of fifty dollars as an advancement of the costs of the proceeding, and the petition shall be signed by not less than fifty voters or owners of real property within the proposed district and shall pray for the incorporation of the territory therein described into a public water supply district. The petition shall be verified by at least one of the signers of the petition, including a statement confirming that service has been made by certified mail to the city manager or the business office of any municipality with boundaries located not more than one mile from any boundary of the proposed district.\n\n2. Upon the filing of the petition, the same shall be presented to the circuit court, and such court shall fix a date for a hearing on such petition, as herein provided for. Thereupon the clerk of the court shall give notice of the filing of the petition in some newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proceedings are pending, and if the district extends into any other county or counties, such notice shall also be published in some newspaper of general circulation in such other county or counties. The notice shall contain a description of the proposed boundary lines of the district and the general purposes of the petition, and shall set forth the date fixed for the hearing on the petition, which shall not be less than seven nor more than twenty-one days after the date of the last publication of the notice and shall be on some regular judicial day of the court wherein the petition is pending. Such notice shall be signed by the clerk of the circuit court and shall be published in three successive issues of a weekly newspaper or in a daily newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks.\n\n3. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the case or the hearing thereon from time to time until final disposition thereof.\n\n4. Exceptions to the formation of a district, or to the boundaries outlined in the petition for the incorporation thereof, may be made by any voter or owner of real property in the proposed district or by any municipality with boundaries located not more than one mile from any boundary of the proposed district; provided, such exceptions are filed not less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing on the petition. Such exceptions shall specify the grounds upon which the exceptions are being made. If any such exceptions be filed, the court shall take them into consideration in passing upon the petition and shall also consider the evidence in support of the petition and in support of the exceptions made. Should the court find that the petition should be granted but that changes should be made in the boundary lines, it shall make such changes in the boundary lines as set forth in the petition as to the court may seem meet and proper, and thereupon enter its decree of incorporation, with such boundaries as changed.\n\n5. Should the court find that it would not be to the public interest to form such a district, the petition shall be dismissed at the costs of the petitioners. If, however, the court should find in favor of the formation of such district, the court shall enter its decree of incorporation, setting forth the boundaries of the proposed district as determined by the court pursuant to the aforesaid hearing. The decree of incorporation shall also divide the district into five subdistricts and shall fix their boundary lines, all of which subdistricts shall have approximately the same area and shall be numbered. The decree shall further contain an appointment of one voter from each of such subdistricts, to constitute the first board of directors of the district. No two members of such board so appointed or hereafter elected or appointed shall reside in the same subdistrict, except as provided in section 247.060. If no qualified person who lives in the subdistrict is willing to serve on the board, the court may appoint, or the voters may elect, an otherwise qualified person who lives in the district but not in the subdistrict. The court shall designate two of such directors so appointed to serve for a term of two years and one to serve for a term of one year. And the directors thus appointed by the court shall serve for the terms thus designated and until their successors shall have been appointed or elected as herein provided. The decree shall further designate the name and number of the district by which it shall hereafter be officially known.\n\n6. The decree of incorporation shall not become final and conclusive until it shall have been submitted to the voters residing within the boundaries described in such decree and until it shall have been assented to by a majority of the voters as provided in subsection 9 of this section or by two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on the proposition. The decree shall provide for the submission of the question and shall fix the date thereof. The returns shall be certified by the judges and clerks of election to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the case and the court shall thereupon enter its order canvassing the returns and declaring the result of such election.\n\n7. If, upon canvass and declaration, it is found and determined that the question shall have been assented to by a majority of two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on such proposition, then the court shall, in such order declaring the result of the election, enter a further order declaring the decree of incorporation to be final and conclusive. In the event, however, that the court should find that the question had not been assented to by the majority above required, the court shall enter a further order declaring such decree of incorporation to be void and of no effect. No appeal shall lie from any such decree of incorporation nor from any of the aforesaid orders. In the event that the court declares the decree of incorporation to be final, as herein provided for, the clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of such decree of incorporation and of such final order with the secretary of state of the state of Missouri, and with the recorder of deeds of the county or counties in which the district is situate and with the clerk of the county commission of the county or counties in which the district is situate.\n\n8. The costs incurred in the formation of the district shall be taxed to the district, if the district be incorporated, otherwise against the petitioners.\n\n9. If petitioners seeking formation of a public water supply district specify in their petition that the district to be organized shall be organized without authority to issue general obligation bonds, then the decrees relating to the formation of the district shall recite that the district shall not have authority to issue general obligation bonds and the vote required for such a decree of incorporation to become final and conclusive shall be a simple majority of the voters of the district voting on such proposition.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 12623, A.L. 1978 H.B. 971 merged with H.B. 1634, A.L. 1991 H.B. 619, A.L. 1993 S.B. 392, A.L. 1995 H.B. 88, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1622 merged with S.B. 479, A.L. 1999 H.B. 450 merged with S.B. 160 & 82, A.L. 2002 S.B. 984 & 985, A.L. 2004 S.B. 987)",

In no event, however, shall a board member receive any attendance fees or additional compensation authorized in subsection 5 of this section until after such board member has completed a minimum of six hours training regarding the responsibilities of the board and its members concerning the basics of water treatment and distribution, budgeting and rates, water utility planning, the funding of capital improvements, the understanding of water utility financial statements, the Missouri sunshine law, and this chapter.\n\n7. The circuit court of the county having jurisdiction over the district shall have jurisdiction over the members of the board of directors to suspend any member from exercising his or her office, whensoever it appears that he or she has abused his or her trust or become disqualified; to remove any member upon proof or conviction of gross misconduct or disqualification for his or her office; or to restrain and prevent any alienation of property of the district by members, in cases where it is threatened, or there is good reason to apprehend that it is intended to be made in fraud of the rights and interests of the district.\n\n8. The jurisdiction conferred by this section shall be exercised as in ordinary cases upon petition, filed by or at the instance of any member of the board, or at the instance of any ten voters residing in the district who join in the petition, verified by the affidavit of at least one of them. The petition shall be heard in a summary manner after ten days' notice in writing to the member or officer complained of. An appeal shall lie from the judgment of the circuit court as in other causes, and shall be speedily determined; but an appeal does not operate under any condition as a supersedeas of a judgment of suspension or removal from office.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 12625, A.L. 1978 H.B. 971, A.L. 1982 S.B. 526, A.L. 1989 S.B. 98, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1230, A.L. 1991 H.B. 619, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58, A.L. 2007 H.B. 795 merged with S.B. 22, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1881 merged with S.B. 956, A.L. 2011 H.B. 89, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1692)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nNonseverability clause, 640.099",

Any district organized hereunder shall have power to borrow money for any of the purposes provided for in sections 247.010 to 247.220, and to issue bonds therefor. In such event the board of directors shall proceed substantially as follows: The board shall adopt a resolution, reciting the necessity for the borrowing of money, the amount of money necessary to be raised, the purposes thereof, and the amount and type or character of bonds to be issued. Such resolution shall also fix the date of an election to be held for the purpose of testing the sense of the voters of the district on the question of incurring such indebtedness and issue bonds in evidence thereof.\n\n2. Such resolution may submit at such election a proposal to issue general obligation bonds or special obligation bonds, or both, but in no event shall the board of directors have authority to issue bonds unless at such election the constitutionally required percentage of the qualified voters of the district voting on any general obligation bonds shall assent thereto and a simple majority of the qualified voters of the district voting on any special obligation bonds shall assent thereto.\n\n3.

General obligation bonds, within the meaning of said sections, shall be bonds issued within the limitation of indebtedness prescribed under Section 26 of Article VI of the Constitution of Missouri, for the payment of which, both principal and interest, a direct tax may be levied upon all taxable property within the district. Before or at the time of issuing general obligation bonds, the board of directors shall provide for the collection of an annual tax, to be levied upon all taxable property within the district sufficient to pay the interest on such bonds as it falls due, and also to constitute a sinking fund for the payment of the principal thereof within twenty years from the date of such bonds; provided, however, that the net income and revenue arising from the operation of the waterworks system of such district, after providing for costs of operation, maintenance, depreciation and necessary extensions and enlargements, shall be transferred to and become a part of the interest and sinking fund applicable to such general obligation bonds, unless or until such net revenues are pledged to the payment of special obligation bonds as herein provided.\n\n5. Special obligation bonds, within the meaning of sections 247.010 to 247.220, shall be bonds payable, both as to principal and interest, wholly and only out of the net income and revenues arising from the operation of the waterworks system of any such district, after providing for costs of operation, maintenance, depreciation and necessary extensions and enlargements, and such bonds shall not be deemed to be indebtedness of any such district within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation upon the incurring of indebtedness. Before or at the time of issuing any such special obligation bonds, the board of directors shall pledge such net income and revenues to the payment of such bonds, both principal and interest, and shall covenant to fix, maintain and collect rates for water and water service supplied by such district so as to assure that such net income and revenues will be sufficient for the purposes herein required.\n\n6. All bonds issued under the provisions of sections 247.010 to 247.220 shall be payable serially, beginning not more than five years after the date they bear; the last installment of any general obligation bonds so issued shall be payable not more than twenty years after such date, and the last installment of any special obligation bonds so issued shall be payable not more than thirty-five years after such date.

The second party shall appoint one commissioner within thirty days of the service of the application upon the second party. If the second party fails to appoint a commissioner within such time period, the court shall appoint a commissioner on behalf of the second party. Such two named commissioners may agree to appoint a third disinterested commissioner within thirty days after the appointment of the second commissioner. In any case in which such two commissioners cannot agree on or fail to make the appointment of the third disinterested commissioner within thirty days after the appointment of the second commissioner, the court shall appoint the third disinterested commissioner.\n\n3. Upon the filing of such application and the appointment of three such commissioners, the court shall set a time for one or more hearings and shall order a public notice including the nature of the application, the annexed area affected, the names of the commissioners, and the time and place of such hearings, to be published for three weeks consecutively in a newspaper published in the county in which the application is pending, the last publication to be not more than seven days before the date set for the first hearing.\n\n4. The commissioners shall develop an agreement between the district and the municipality to provide water service to the annexed territory. In developing the agreement, the commissioners shall consider information presented to them at hearings and any other information at their disposal including, but not limited to:\n\n(1) The estimated future loss of revenue and costs for the water district related to the agreement;\n\n(2) The amount of indebtedness of the water district within the annexed territory;\n\n(3) Any contractual obligations of the water district within the annexed area; and\n\n(4) The effect of the agreement on the water rates of the district.­­Such agreement shall also include a recommendation for the apportionment of court costs, including reasonable compensation for the commissioners, between the municipality and the water district.\n\n­­Such agreement shall also include a recommendation for the apportionment of court costs, including reasonable compensation for the commissioners, between the municipality and the water district.\n\n5. If the court finds that the agreement provides for necessary water service in the annexed territory, then such agreement shall be fully effective upon approval by the court. The court shall also review the recommended apportionment of court costs and the reasonable compensation for the commissioners and affirm or modify such recommendations.\n\n6. The order and judgment of the court shall be subject to appeal as provided by law.\n\n7. If the court approves a detachment as part of the territorial agreement, it shall make its order and judgment detaching the territory described in the petition from the remainder of the district and stating the boundary lines of the district after such detachment. The court shall also make any changes in subdistrict boundary lines it deems necessary to meet the requirements of sections 247.110 to 247.227. Any subdistrict lines shall not become effective until the next annual regular election.\n\n8. At such time that the court's order and judgment becomes final, the clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of such order and judgment with the secretary of state and with the recorder of deeds and the county clerk of the county or counties in which the district is located.\n\n(L. 2001 S.B. 267)",

Whenever any city owning a waterworks or water supply system extends its corporate limits to include any part of the area in a public water supply district, and the city and the board of directors of the district are unable to agree upon a service, lease or sale agreement, or are unable to proceed under section 247.160, then upon the expiration of ninety days after the effective date of the extension of the city limits, that part of the area of the district included within the corporate limits of the city may be detached and excluded from the district in the following manner:\n\n(1) A petition to detach and exclude that part of the public water supply district lying within the corporate limits of the city as such limits have been extended, signed by not less than five percent of the registered voters who are patrons of the water supply district, or twenty registered voters that are patrons of each subdistrict, whichever is less, shall be filed in the circuit court of the county in which the district was originally organized.\n\n(2) The court, being satisfied as to the sufficiency of the petition, shall call a special election of the voters of the district at which election the proposal to detach and exclude the part of the district lying within the corporate limits of the city shall be submitted to the voters in the entire district for a vote thereon. The election shall be conducted within the district by the election authority.\n\n(3) The ballot shall briefly state the question to be voted on.\n\n(4) In order to approve the detachment and exclusion of any part of the area in a public water supply district, the proposal shall require the approval of not less than a majority of the voters voting thereon.\n\n(5) The election authorities shall thereafter promptly certify the result to the circuit court. The court, acting as a court of equity, shall thereupon without delay enter a decree detaching and excluding the area in question located within the corporate limits of the city from the public water supply district; except that before the decree detaching and excluding the area becomes final or effective, the city shall show to the court that it has assumed and agreed to pay in lump sum or in installments not less than that proportion of the sum of all existing liquidated general obligations and of all unpaid revenue bonds and interest thereon to date of the water supply district as the assessed valuation of the real and tangible personal property within the area sought to be detached and excluded bears to the assessed valuation of all of the real and tangible personal property within the entire area of the district, according to the official county assessment of property as of December thirty-first of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election, and in addition thereto that the city has assumed and agreed to assume or pay in a lump sum all contractual obligations of the water district that are greater than twenty-five thousand dollars for debt that pertains to infrastructure, fixed assets or obligations for the purchase of water, and to pay the court costs.\n\n(6) The decree shall thereupon vest in the city the absolute title, free and clear of all liens or encumbrances of every kind and character, to all tangible real and personal property of the public water supply district located within the part of the district situated within the corporate limits of the city with full power in the city to use and dispose of the tangible real and personal property as it deems best in the public interest.\n\n(7) If the proposal fails to receive the approval of the voters the question may be again presented by another petition and again voted on, but not sooner than six months.\n\n(8) Any and all sums paid out by the city under this section, other than the costs of the election, shall be administered by the circuit court for the benefit of the holders of the then existing and outstanding bonds of the district, and the remainder of such sums, if any, shall be delivered to the district to be expended in the operation, maintenance and improvement of its water distribution system.\n\n2.

Competition to sell and distribute water, as between and among public water supply districts, water corporations subject to public service commission jurisdiction, and municipally owned utilities may be displaced by written territorial agreements, but only to the extent hereinafter provided for in this section.\n\n2. Such territorial agreements shall specifically designate the boundaries of the water service area of each water supplier subject to the agreement, any and all powers granted to a public water supply district by a municipality, pursuant to the agreement, to operate within the corporate boundaries of that municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 247.010 to 247.670 to the contrary, and any and all powers granted to a municipally owned utility, pursuant to the agreement, to operate in areas beyond the corporate municipal boundaries of its municipality.\n\n3. Where the parties cannot agree upon the boundaries of the water service areas that are to be set forth in the agreement, they may, by mutual consent of all parties involved, petition the public service commission to designate the boundaries of the water service areas to be served by each party and such designations by the commission shall be binding on all such parties. Petitions shall be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity and the commission shall hold evidentiary hearings on all petitions so received as required in subsection 5 of this section. The commission shall base its final determination regarding such petitions upon a finding that the commission's designation of water service areas is in the public interest.\n\n4. Before becoming effective, all territorial agreements entered into under the provisions of this section, including any subsequent amendments to such agreements, or the transfer or assignment of the agreement or any rights or obligations of any party to an agreement, shall receive the approval of the public service commission by report and order. Applications for commission approval shall be made and notice of such filing shall be given to other water suppliers pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission governing applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission for good cause shown, the commission shall rule on such applications not later than one hundred twenty days after the application is properly filed with the secretary of the commission.\n\n5.

Commission approval of any territorial agreement entered into under the provisions of this section shall in no way affect or diminish the rights and duties of any water supplier not a party to the agreement to provide service within the boundaries designated in such territorial agreement. In the event any water corporation which is not a party to the territorial agreement and which is subject to the jurisdiction, control and regulation of the commission under chapters 386 and 393 has sought or hereafter seeks authorization from the commission to sell and distribute water or construct, operate and maintain water supply facilities within the boundaries designated in any such territorial agreement, the commission, in making its determination regarding such requested authority, shall give no consideration or weight to the existence of any such territorial agreement and any actual rendition of retail water supply services by any of the parties to such territorial agreement will not preclude the commission from granting the requested authority.\n\n7. The commission shall have jurisdiction to entertain and hear complaints involving any commission-approved territorial agreement. Such complaints shall be brought and prosecuted in the same manner as other complaints before the commission. The commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing regarding such complaints, except that in those instances where the matter is resolved by a stipulation and agreement submitted to the commission by all the parties, such hearings may be waived by agreement of the parties.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 386.410, the commission shall by rule set a schedule of fees based upon its costs in reviewing proposed territorial agreements for approval or disapproval.

The fees shall be paid to the director of revenue who shall remit such payments to the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall credit such payments to the public service commission fund, or its successor fund, as established in section 33.571.

After the board of directors of any public water supply district has entered into a contract to sell part or all of its water mains, plant, real estate or equipment, pursuant to this section, an application shall be made by said board of directors to the circuit court which originally incorporated the district, which application shall set forth a copy of the contract entered into by the parties, and the facts concerning the bondholders and their rights, and requesting an order of the court approving or disapproving the contract.\n\n3.

Any two or more contiguous public water supply districts organized under the provisions of sections 247.010 to 247.220 may be consolidated into a single district by a decree of the circuit court in which the district with the largest acreage was originally incorporated and organized.\n\n2. Proceedings for consolidation of such districts shall be substantially as follows: The board of directors of each of the districts to be consolidated shall authorize, by resolution passed at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for such purpose, its president, on behalf of the district, to petition the circuit court having jurisdiction for consolidation with any one or more other contiguous public water supply districts.\n\n3.

The notice shall contain a description of the subject boundary lines of the district and the general purposes of the petition, and shall set forth the date fixed for the hearing on the petition, which shall not be less than seven nor more than twenty-one days after the date of the last publication of the notice and shall be on some regular judicial day of the court wherein the petition is pending. Such notice shall be signed by the clerk of the circuit court and shall be published in three successive issues of a weekly newspaper or in twenty successive issues of a daily newspaper.\n\n3. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the case or the hearing thereon from time to time until final disposition thereof.\n\n4. Exceptions to the dissolution of a district may be made by any voter or landowner of the district, and by the district as herein provided; such exceptions shall be filed not less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing on the petition. Such exceptions shall specify the grounds upon which the exceptions are filed and the court shall take them into consideration in passing upon the petition and shall also consider the evidence in support of the petition and in support of the exceptions made. Unless petitioners prove that all debts and financial obligations of the district can be paid in full upon dissolution, the petition shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners.\n\n5. Should the court find that it would not be to the public interest to dissolve a district, the petition shall be dismissed at the costs of the petitioners. If, however, the court should find in favor of the petitioners, the court shall enter its interlocutory decree of dissolution which decree shall provide for the submission of the question to the voters of the district in substantially the following form:\n\nShall ______ Public Water Supply District be dissolved?\n\n6. The decree of dissolution shall not become final and conclusive until it shall have been submitted to the voters residing within the boundaries described in such decree and until it shall have been assented to by a majority of two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on the proposition. The decree shall provide for the submission of the question and shall fix the date thereof. The returns shall be certified by the election authority to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the case and the court shall thereupon enter its order canvassing the returns and declaring the result of such election.\n\n7. If, upon canvass and declaration, it is found and determined that the question shall have been assented to by a majority of two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on such proposition then the court shall, in such order declaring the result of the election, enter a further order declaring the decree of dissolution to be final and conclusive. In the event, however, that the court should find that the question had not been assented to by the majority required, the court shall enter a further order declaring such decree of dissolution to be void and of no effect. No appeal shall lie from any of the aforesaid orders. In the event that the court declares the decree of dissolution to be final, as provided in this section, the clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of such decree of dissolution and of such final order with the secretary of state of the state of Missouri, and with the recorder of deeds of the county or counties in which the district is situate and with the clerk of the county commission of the county or counties in which the district is situate.\n\n8. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, no district shall be dissolved until after all of its debts shall have been paid, and the court, in its decree of dissolution, shall provide for the disposition of the property of the district.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 12638, A.L. 1978 H.B. 971, A.L. 1993 H.B. 655, A.L. 1997 S.B. 175, A.L. 2002 S.B. 984 & 985)",
