(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any sewer district is authorized to enter into design-build contracts for design-build projects that exceed an expenditure of one million dollars.\n\n(2) In using a design-build contract, the sewer district shall establish a written procedure by rule for prequalifying design-build contractors before such design-build contractors will be allowed to make a proposal on the project.\n\n(3) The sewer district shall adopt procedures for:\n\n(a) The prequalification review team;\n\n(b) Specifications for the design criteria package;\n\n(c) The method of advertising, receiving, and evaluating proposals from design-build contractors;\n\n(d) The criteria for awarding the design-build contract based on the design criteria package and a separate proposal stating the cost of construction; and\n\n(e) Other methods, procedures, and criteria necessary to administer this section.\n\n(4) The sewer district is authorized to issue a request for proposals to a maximum of five design-build contractors who are prequalified in accordance with this section.\n\n(5) The sewer district may require approval of any person performing subcontract work on the design-build project including, but not limited to, those furnishing design services, labor, materials or equipment.\n\n3. (1) Before the prequalification process specified in this section, the sewer district shall publicly advertise, once a week for two consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation, qualified under chapter 493, located within the cities located in the sewer district, or if there be no such newspaper, in a qualified newspaper of general circulation in the county, or if there be no such newspaper, in a qualified newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county, and may advertise in business, trade, or minority newspapers, for qualification submissions on said design-build project.\n\n(2) If the sewer district fails to receive at least two responsive submissions from prequalified design-build contractors, submissions shall not be opened and the sewer shall readvertise the project.\n\n(3) The sewer district shall have the right to reject any and all submissions and proposals.\n\n(4) The proposals from prequalified design-build contractors shall be submitted sealed and in writing, to be opened publicly at the time and place of the sewer district's choosing.

(1) The payment bond requirements of section 107.170 shall apply to the design-build project. All persons furnishing design services shall be deemed to be covered by the payment bond the same as any person furnishing labor or materials; however, the performance bond for the design-build contractor does not need to cover the design services as long as the design-build contractor or its subcontractors providing design services carry professional liability insurance in an amount established by the sewer district in the request for proposals.\n\n(2) Any person or firm providing architectural, engineering, or land surveying services for the design-build contractor on the design-build project shall be duly licensed or authorized in this state to provide such services as required by chapter 327.\n\n5.

The sewer district shall also retain that same architect or engineer or another to perform contract administration functions on behalf of the sewer district during the construction phase and after project completion. If the sewer district has an architect or engineer capable of fulfilling the functions described in this section, the sewer district is exempt from being required to retain another such professional.\n\n(2) Any architect or engineer who is retained by a sewer district under this section shall be ineligible to act as the design-build contractor, or to participate as part of the design-build contractor's team as a subcontractor, joint venturer, partner, or otherwise for the same design-build project for which the architect or engineer was hired by the sewer district.\n\n6. Under section 327.465, any design-build contractor that enters into a design-build contract for a sewer district is exempt from the requirement that such person or entity hold a certificate of registration or such corporation hold a certificate of authority if the architectural, engineering, or land surveying services to be performed under the contract are performed through subcontracts with properly licensed and authorized persons or entities, and not performed by the design-build contractor or its own employees.\n\n(L. 2011 S.B. 173)",

A sewer district organized under the provisions of sections 249.763 to 249.810 is a political subdivision of the state and as such has the same rights and privileges and is subject to the same legal restrictions as are other similar political subdivisions.\n\n2. The board shall have the general power to manage the affairs of the district and all powers vested in the district shall be exercised by its board of supervisors except insofar as approval of any action by popular vote may be expressly required by law.\n\n3. Every district shall have the powers and purposes prescribed by this section and such others as may now or hereafter be prescribed by law. No express grant of power or enumeration of powers herein shall be deemed to limit the generality or scope of any grant of power.\n\n4. A district may sue and be sued and may enter into any contract necessary or proper for the exercise of its powers or the accomplishment of its purposes.\n\n5. A district may acquire by purchase, gift or condemnation or may lease or rent any real or personal property. All the powers may be exercised both within or without the district as may be necessary for the exercise of its powers or the accomplishment of its purposes. A district may hold property for such purposes, and may lease or rent out or sell or otherwise dispose of any property so far as not needed for such purposes.\n\n6. The district has the right to lay its lines in public highways, roads, streets and alleys within the district and to repair and maintain them but it must be done under reasonable rules and regulations of the governmental bodies having jurisdiction over these public places. In the construction of ditches, laying of lines, filling of ditches after lines are laid, connection of pipes and repairing of lines, due regard must be taken of the public in its use of thoroughfares and the equal rights of other utilities.\n\n7. Proceedings for the condemnation of property shall be the same as proceedings provided for the condemnation of property by second class counties except that the proceedings shall be instituted and carried through by the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors shall also have the same authority to enter upon private lands to survey land or other property before exercise of the above condemnation powers as is granted under section 388.210 to railroad corporations.\n\n8. The board of supervisors may accept and utilize donations, gifts or contributions from the owners of property within the district or from others, and if funds acquired in this manner are adequate for the construction and maintenance of the sewer system, no bonds shall be issued.\n\n9. Each district created or reorganized under sections 249.763 to 249.810 shall have all of the powers necessary and convenient so that it may furnish sewage disposal outlets and, in conjunction therewith, to provide for the construction, acquisition, betterment, operation, maintenance and administration of any disposal systems, individual home or business sewage treatment systems, sewage treatment plants, interceptors, mains, laterals, drains and all other appurtenances incidental thereto as the board shall determine to be necessary and expedient.\n\n10. A district may, upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the respective governing bodies or authorities concerned, provide for connecting with or using or may lease or acquire and take over any system, works or facilities for the purposes herein provided belonging to any other governmental subdivision or other public agency.\n\n11. A district may, upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the respective governing bodies or authorities concerned, authorize the use by any other governmental subdivision or other public agency of any system, works or facilities of the district constructed for any purpose herein provided so far as the capacity thereof is sufficient beyond the needs of the district. A district may extend any such system, works or facilities and permit the use thereof by persons outside the district, so far as the capacity thereof is sufficient beyond the needs of the district, upon such terms as the board may prescribe.\n\n12. A district may be a party to a joint cooperative project, undertaking or enterprise with any one or more other governmental subdivisions or other public agencies for any purpose herein provided upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the governing bodies or authorities concerned. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provision or any other provisions herein, a district, with respect to any of its purposes, may act under and be subject to the provisions of Section 16 of Article VI of the Constitution of Missouri, and chapter 70.\n\n13. The district may contract with each participating community for the payment of its proportionate share of treatment costs.\n\n14. The district may refuse to receive any wastes into the sewage system which do not meet relevant state or federal water pollution, solid waste, or pretreatment standards.\n\n15. If the county in which a sewer district lies, at any time while the district is in existence, changes its class to become something other than a second class county, the sewer district may continue to operate under the provisions of sections 249.763 to 249.810 as those sections now exist or as they may be amended.\n\n16. After the owner of the sewer treatment system has been notified of any violation and has been given a reasonable time of not less than thirty days in which to come into compliance, it shall be a class C misdemeanor for any sewer treatment system to be operated within the jurisdiction of the sewer district which is not in compliance with applicable water pollution, solid waste or pretreatment regulations or ordinances. Any penalty imposed by this subsection shall not preclude any appropriate civil remedy.\n\n17. In addition to other powers granted it by law, a sewer district organized under the provisions of sections 249.763 to 249.810 may, subject to the approval of a majority of the voters of the district who vote thereon, levy a special assessment, tax, fee, or charge on the property, or any portion thereof, within the district which is or will be served by the facilities to be built, maintained, or operated with the revenues of such special assessment, tax, fee, or charge.\n\n(L. 1961 p. 451 § 10, A.L. 1983 H.B. 371, A.L. 1985 H.B. 95)",

Any bonds, notes, and other obligations issued or delivered by the district may be secured by mortgage, pledge, or deed of trust of any or all of the property within the district. Every issue of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be payable out of property and revenues of the district and may be further secured by other property within the district, which may be pledged, assigned, mortgaged, or a security interest granted for such payment, without preference or priority of the first bonds issued, subject to any agreement with the holders of any other bonds pledging any specified property or revenues. Such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the district board, and shall bear such date or dates, and shall mature at such time or times, but not in excess of thirty years, as the resolution shall specify.

In the event that any property within the watershed improvement district proposed under this section lies within or is serviced by any existing sewer district formed under this chapter, chapter 204, or chapter 250, the property shall not become part of the watershed improvement district formed under this section unless the existing sewer district agrees to refrain from providing service or to discontinue service to the property. No property shall become part of the watershed district until the owner of that property has paid in full all outstanding costs owed to an existing sewer district formed under this chapter, chapter 204, or chapter 250.\n\n7. Upon the creation of the watershed improvement district as authorized by this section, a board of trustees for the district consisting of nine members shall be appointed. The governing body of each county shall appoint one member to serve on the board. No trustee shall reside in the same county as another trustee. Of the initial trustees appointed, five shall serve terms of one year, and four shall serve terms of two years, as determined by lot. After the initial appointments of the trustees, the successor trustees shall reside in the same county as the prior trustee and be elected by the resident property owners of their county within the district. Each trustee may be elected to no more than five consecutive two-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled by the board. Each trustee shall serve until a successor is elected and sworn. The trustees shall not receive compensation for their services, but may be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses. The board shall elect a chair and other officers necessary for its membership. The board shall enter into contracts with any person or entity for the maintenance, administrative, or support work required to administer the district.

The board may adopt resolutions necessary to the operation of the district.\n\n8. No service shall be initiated to any property lying within the watershed improvement district created under this section unless the property owner elects to have the service provided by the district.\n\n9.

Property owners participating in the watershed improvement district formed under this section shall be required as a condition of continued participation to have a maintenance plan approved by the watershed improvement district for the on-site wastewater treatment systems on their properties. Such property owners shall also execute a utilities easement to allow the district access to the system for maintenance purposes and inspections. The property owner shall provide satisfactory proof that periodic maintenance is performed on the sewage system. At a minimum the system shall be installed and maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The level of satisfactory proof required and the frequency of periodic proof shall be determined by the board of trustees.\n\n11. A district established under this section may, at a general or primary election, submit to the qualified voters within the district boundaries a real property tax that shall not exceed five cents per one hundred dollars assessed valuation to fund the operation of the district. The ballot of submission shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast in each county that is part of the district favor the proposal, then the real property tax shall become effective in the district on the first day of the year following the year of the election. If a majority of the votes cast in each county that is a part of the district oppose the proposal, then that county shall not impose the real property tax authorized in this section until after the county governing body has submitted another such real property tax proposal and the proposal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting thereon. However, if a real property tax proposal is not approved, the governing body of the county shall not resubmit a proposal to the voters under this section sooner than twelve months from the date of the last proposal submitted under this section.\n\n12. The real property tax authorized by this section is in addition to all other real property taxes allowed by law.\n\n13. Once the real property tax authorized by this section is abolished or terminated by any means, all funds remaining in the trust fund shall be used solely for the purposes approved in the ballot question authorizing the tax. The tax shall not be abolished or terminated while the district has any financing or other obligations outstanding. Any funds in the trust fund which are not needed for current expenditures may be invested by the district in the securities described in subdivisions (1) to (12) of subsection 1 of section 30.270 or repurchase agreements secured by such securities.\n\n14. The governing body of any county included in the Upper White River Basin watershed improvement district established in this section may designate groundwater depletion areas within specific areas of the county and may require well volume monitoring. However, any county included in this district may choose not to require well volume monitoring.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 1433, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with H.B. 617)",
