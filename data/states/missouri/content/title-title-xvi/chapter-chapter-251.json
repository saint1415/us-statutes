Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the regional economic development district sales tax imposed under this section when imposed within a special taxing district, including but not limited to a tax increment financing district, neighborhood improvement district, or community improvement district, shall be excluded from the calculation of revenues available to such districts, and no revenues from any sales tax imposed under this section shall be used for the purposes of any such district unless approved by the regional economic development district board established under the regional economic development district law and the governing body of the city or county imposing the tax.\n\n12. The board of the district shall make a report at least annually on the use of the funds provided under this section and on the progress of any plan, project, or area designation adopted under this section and shall make such report available to the public and the governing body of the city or county imposing the tax.\n\n13. (1) No city or county imposing a sales tax under this section may repeal or amend such sales tax unless such repeal or amendment will not impair the district's ability to repay any liabilities which it has incurred, money which it has borrowed, or revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which it has issued to finance any project or projects.\n\n(2) Whenever the governing body of any city or county in which a regional economic development district sales tax has been imposed in the manner provided by this section receives a petition, signed by ten percent of the qualified voters of such city or county calling for an election to repeal such regional economic development district sales tax, the governing body shall, if such repeal will not impair the district's ability to repay any liabilities which it has incurred, money which it has borrowed, or revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which it has issued to finance any project or projects, submit to the voters of such city or county a proposal to repeal the regional economic development district sales tax imposed under this section. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the proposal to repeal the regional economic development district sales tax, then the resolution imposing the regional economic development district sales tax, along with any amendments thereto, is repealed. If a majority of the votes cast by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the proposal to repeal the regional economic development district sales tax, then the resolution imposing the regional economic development district sales tax, along with any amendments thereto, shall remain in effect.\n\n14. If any provision of the regional economic development district law or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of the regional economic development district law which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of the regional economic development district law are declared severable.\n\n(L. 2007 H.B. 741)",
