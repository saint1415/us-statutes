Infectious waste, treatment of — hospitals, department of health and senior services to promulgate rules — transportation of — registration of hospitals — proper disposal, penalty — fee on delivery, exceptions — inspection fee, amount, fund, refund of, when. —1. Any infectious waste transferred from the premises of the generator shall be taken to an infectious waste processing facility that holds a valid permit issued by the department, or a hospital as defined in section 197.020.\n\n2. No infectious waste shall be placed into a solid waste disposal area except as otherwise provided for in sections 260.200 to 260.245 unless it has been treated or rendered innocuous by a permitted infectious waste processing facility as provided in sections 260.200 to 260.245, or by a hospital as defined in section 197.020, by autoclaving, incineration, chemical disinfection, or other methods of treatment approved by the department. The department of health and senior services shall promulgate rules covering the handling and treatment of infectious waste by hospitals as defined in section 197.020 and such rules shall be consistent with the rules of the department under sections 260.200 to 260.245, and shall be effective no later than January 1, 1989.\n\n3. All such wastes, when transported off the premises of the generator shall be packaged and transported as provided by rule under sections 260.200 to 260.245, except that hospitals and small quantity generators as defined by the department under this section may transport infectious waste to a hospital for treatment, an infectious waste processing facility for treatment or to a central collection point using their employees and vehicles as long as they meet all other requirements of sections 260.200 to 260.245 and the rules and regulations promulgated under sections 260.200 to 260.245.\n\n4. The department of health and senior services shall provide for a registration process for all hospitals pursuant to the provisions of sections 260.200 to 260.245 and section 192.005. The process shall include a completed and signed application on forms provided by the department of health and senior services. The forms shall contain the following:\n\n(1) A statement certifying that the applicant understands and will comply with the applicable requirements of sections 260.200 to 260.245; and\n\n(2) Other requirements established by the department of health and senior services.\n\n5. Registrations shall be renewed annually.\n\n6. Unless otherwise provided for in sections 260.200 to 260.245, any person who treats infectious waste to the specifications of the department of natural resources or the department of health and senior services, and who proposes to dispose of the residue thereof in a sanitary landfill shall properly identify the waste and shall certify to the transporter and the sanitary landfill operator that the waste has been rendered innocuous and may be legally placed in a sanitary landfill pursuant to the provisions of this section. Persons found to be in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n7. Facilities permitted to treat infectious waste shall adhere to an operation plan for the handling and treatment of infectious waste approved by the department of natural resources as provided by rule, and hospitals, as defined in section 197.020, allowed to treat infectious waste shall adhere to an operation plan for the handling and treatment of infectious waste approved by the department of health and senior services as provided by rule. The plan shall include, but not be limited to, methods of handling and treating the waste, protection of employees and the public and the maximum amount of waste which may be handled per month. Approval for acceptance of infectious waste may be withdrawn for noncompliance with the operation plan. No permitted infectious waste treatment facility shall operate unless it has a solid waste technician trained in the handling of infectious waste on site during any treatment process. Such operator shall meet the requirements established by the department pursuant to section 260.205.\n\n8. Any transporter or generator who delivers infectious waste to an infectious waste processing facility, except small quantity generators and hospitals located in Missouri and defined in section 197.020, shall pay a fee of two dollars for each ton of infectious waste so delivered. Such fees shall be collected by the infectious waste processing facility accepting the waste and transmitted to the department. The department shall promptly transmit funds collected under this section to the director of the department of revenue for deposit in the solid waste management fund. Moneys, upon appropriation, shall be used to help pay for the administrative costs associated with infectious waste management. Any transporter or generator who transports infectious waste for more than three hundred miles for management in Missouri shall pay, in addition to the charges above, an additional charge equal to ten percent of the gross charge charged by the processing facility for the management of such waste. Such fees shall be collected by the infectious waste processing facility accepting the waste and transmitted to the department which shall promptly transmit such fees to the department of revenue for deposit in the general revenue fund.\n\n9. Hospitals defined in chapter 197, and located in Missouri, may manage infectious waste generated on the premises by autoclaving, incineration, chemical disinfection or other methods of treatment approved by the department of health and senior services. Such hospitals may also treat infectious waste produced by small quantity generators and other hospitals located in Missouri upon the approval of the department of natural resources and the department of health and senior services. Failure of either department to respond by issuing a certification to accept infectious waste in writing to a hospital which has filed in writing to both departments a notice of intent to treat waste from another hospital within ninety days constitutes approval of the treatment. All hospitals licensed by the state of Missouri pursuant to chapter 197 are exempt from all taxes or fees imposed pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.480, provided that no more than twenty-five percent, by weight, of the infectious waste managed by such hospitals is produced by other generators which are not owned or operated by the hospital.\n\n10. Persons generating one hundred kilograms or less of infectious waste per month are exempt from the provisions of this section except that the department of health and senior services shall specify by rule, in accordance with section 192.005, infectious waste that shall be rendered innocuous regardless of quantity. Any person who disposes of waste exempt from the provisions of this act*in a sanitary landfill shall certify to the transporter or the sanitary landfill operator that the waste has been handled in a manner consistent with the law and may be legally placed in a sanitary landfill. Rules promulgated by the department of natural resources and the department of health and senior services pursuant to this subsection shall be effective no later than July 1, 1989.

Except as provided in subsection 4 of this section, each city and each county or a combination of cities and counties shall provide individually or collectively for the collection and disposal of solid wastes for those areas within its boundaries that are to be served by the solid waste management system; shall be responsible for implementing their approved plan required by section 260.220 as it relates to the storage, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of their solid wastes; and may purchase all necessary equipment, acquire all necessary land, build any necessary buildings, incinerators, transfer stations, or other structures, lease or otherwise acquire the right to use land or equipment. Each city and county may levy and collect charges for the necessary cost of providing such services, and may levy an annual tax not to exceed ten cents on the one hundred dollars assessed valuation, as authorized by Article X, Section 11(c), of the Constitution for public health purposes to implement a plan for solid waste management, and to do all other things necessary to provide for a proper and effective solid waste management system; except that, the county may not levy a service charge or annual tax upon the inhabitants of any incorporated city, town or village that has an approved plan for solid waste management, unless the city, town or village contracts with the county for solid waste management and consents to the county service charge or tax levy. The tax or service charge authorized by this section shall not be levied if the tax or service charge is levied pursuant to some other provision of law, but if a tax is levied for the operation of a sanitary landfill and such tax is less than the maximum amount authorized by this section, a tax in an amount equal to the difference between such tax and that authorized in this section may be levied and collected.\n\n2. Any city or county may adopt ordinances or orders, rules, regulations, or standards for the storage, collection, transportation, processing or disposal of solid wastes which shall be in conformity with the rules and regulations adopted by the department for solid waste management systems. Nothing in sections 260.200 to 260.245 shall usurp the legal right of a city or county from adopting and enforcing local ordinances, rules, regulations, or standards for the storage, collection, transportation, processing, or disposal of solid wastes equal to or more stringent than the rules or regulations adopted by the department pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.245. Any county or city which adopts orders or ordinances for the management of solid waste shall ensure that such orders or ordinances provide for safe and adequate management of solid waste pursuant to an approved plan under section 260.220 and are not substantially inconsistent with the requirements of sections 260.200 and 260.245 and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.\n\n3.

Upon such a finding by the department, such city or county shall itself operate or contract for the operation of such solid waste collection, transportation and disposal services as may be reasonably necessary to remedy such danger to the public health or to abate such public nuisance, until such city or county, by its solid waste management plan, demonstrates that the storage, collection, transportation, processing and disposal of solid wastes will by other means be carried out in a manner which protects the public health, prevents the creation of public nuisances, and prevents the pollution of the land, air and water of the state. Any person aggrieved by the finding of the department, including any city or county or any privately owned or operated service, may appeal as provided in chapter 536.\n\n5. Any city or county which establishes a service charge for solid waste collection services shall state the service charge separately from any other charge of any kind. No city or county shall withhold, or authorize the withholding of, any other utility service for failure to collect the separately stated service charge.\n\n6.

The department shall have the authority to promulgate rules for the management, closure, and post-closure of coal combustion residual (CCR) units in accordance with Sections 1008(a)(3) and 4004(a) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and to approve site-specific groundwater criteria. At the discretion of the department, the Missouri risk-based corrective action (MRBCA) rules, 10 CSR 25- 18.010, and accompanying guidance may be used to establish site-specific targets for soil and groundwater impacted by coal combustion residual (CCR) constituents. As used in this section, a\"coal combustion residual (CCR) unit\"or\"CCR unit\"means a surface impoundment, utility waste landfill, or a CCR landfill. To the extent there is a conflict between this section and section 644.026 or 644.143, this section shall prevail.\n\n2. Prior to federal approval of a state CCR program under and pursuant to 4004(a) of the RCRA, nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from issuing guidance or entering into enforceable agreements with CCR unit owners or operators to establish risk-based target levels, using all or part of the MRBCA rules and guidance, for closure and corrective action at CCR units. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department, owners, or operators of CCR units not otherwise covered by 40 CFR 257 from utilizing the MRBCA rules and guidance.\n\n3. No later than December 31, 2018, the department shall propose for promulgation a state CCR program, including procedures regarding payment, submission of fees, reimbursement of excess fee collection, inspection, and record keeping.\n\n4. The department shall not apply standards to any existing landfill or new landfills constructed contiguous to existing power station facilities located on municipally owned land that was purchased by the municipality prior to December 31, 2018, that are in conflict with 40 CFR 257, unless sound and reasonably proven scientific data confirm an imminent threat to human health and the environment.\n\n5. Effective January 1, 2019, and in order to implement the state CCR program, the department shall have the authority to assess one-time enrollment and annual fees on each owner, operator, or permittee of a CCR unit subject to 40 CFR 257, only as follows:\n\n(1) For units that have not closed, an enrollment fee in the amount of sixty-two thousand dollars per CCR unit, except no fee shall apply to CCR units permitted as a utility waste landfill;\n\n(2) For CCR units that have completed closure in place under 40 CFR 257 prior to December 31, 2018, an enrollment fee of forty-eight thousand dollars per CCR unit;\n\n(3) An annual fee of fifteen thousand dollars per CCR unit, except an annual fee or fees shall not be assessed on CCR units that have closed prior to December 31, 2018. The obligation to pay an annual fee or fees under this section shall terminate at the end of the CCR unit's postclosure period, so long as the CCR unit is not under a requirement to complete a corrective action, or sooner, if authorized by the department.\n\n6.

Fees collected under this section are dedicated, upon appropriation, to the department for conducting activities required by this section and rules adopted under this section. Fees established by this section shall not yield revenue greater than the cost of administering this section and the rules adopted under this section, but shall be adequate to ensure sustained operation of the state CCR program.

The only purpose of such registration shall be to provide information for the documentation of scrap tire handling as described in subdivision (5) of this subsection, and registration shall not impose any additional requirements on the owner of a scrap tire end-user facility;\n\n(3) Requirements for performance bonds or other forms of financial assurance for scrap tire sites, scrap tire end-user facilities, and scrap tire processing facilities;\n\n(4) Exemptions from the requirements of sections 260.270 to 260.276; and\n\n(5) By January 1, 1996, requirements for record-keeping procedures for retailers and other businesses that generate scrap tires, scrap tire haulers, scrap tire collection centers, scrap tire sites, scrap tire processing facilities, and scrap tire end-user facilities. Required record keeping shall include the source and number or weight of tires received and the destination and number of tires or weight of tires or tire pieces shipped or otherwise disposed of and such records shall be maintained for at least three years following the end of the calendar year of such activity.

Permit fees for scrap tire sites and commercial scrap tire haulers shall be established by rule and shall not exceed the cost of administering sections 260.270 to 260.275. Permit fees shall be deposited into an appropriate subaccount of the solid scrap management fund.\n\n5. The department shall:\n\n(1) Encourage the voluntary establishment of scrap tire collection centers at retail tire selling businesses and scrap tire processing facilities; and\n\n(2) Investigate, locate and document existing sites where tires have been or currently are being accumulated, and initiate efforts to bring these sites into compliance with rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the provisions of sections 260.270 to 260.276.\n\n6. Any person licensed as an auto dismantler and salvage dealer under chapter 301 may without further license, permit or payment of fee, store but shall not bury on his property, up to five hundred scrap tires that have been chipped, cut or shredded, if such tires are only from vehicles acquired by him, and such tires are stored in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the department pursuant to this section. Any tire retailer or wholesaler may hold more than five hundred scrap tires for a period not to exceed thirty days without being permitted as a scrap tire site, if such tires are stored in a manner which protects human health and the environment pursuant to regulations adopted by the department.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of sections 260.270 to 260.276, a person who leases or owns real property may use scrap tires for soil erosion abatement and drainage purposes in accordance with procedures approved by the department, or to secure covers over silage, hay, straw or agricultural products.\n\n8. The department of transportation shall, beginning July 1, 1991, undertake, as part of its currently scheduled highway improvement projects, demonstration projects using recovered rubber from scrap tires as surfacing material, structural material, subbase material and fill, consistent with standard engineering practices. The department shall evaluate the efficacy of using recovered rubber in highway improvements, and shall encourage the modification of road construction specifications, when possible, for the use of recovered rubber in highway improvement projects.\n\n9.

Each fiscal year eight hundred thousand dollars from the solid waste management fund shall be made available, upon appropriation, to the department and the environmental improvement and energy resources authority to fund activities that promote the development and maintenance of markets for recovered materials. Each fiscal year up to two hundred thousand dollars from the solid waste management fund may be used by the department upon appropriation for grants to solid waste management districts for district grants and district operations. Only those solid waste management districts that are allocated fewer funds under subsection 2 of this section than if revenues had been allocated based on the criteria in effect in this section on August 27, 2004, are eligible for these grants. An eligible district shall receive a proportionate share of these grants based on that district's share of the total reduction in funds for eligible districts calculated by comparing the amount of funds allocated under subsection 2 of this section with the amount of funds that would have been allocated using the criteria in effect in this section on August 27, 2004. The department and the authority shall establish a joint interagency agreement with the department of economic development to identify state priorities for market development and to develop the criteria to be used to judge proposed projects. Additional moneys may be appropriated in subsequent fiscal years if requested. The authority shall establish a procedure to measure the effectiveness of the grant program under this subsection and shall provide a report to the governor and general assembly by January fifteenth of each year regarding the effectiveness of the program.\n\n2. All remaining revenues deposited into the fund each fiscal year after moneys have been made available under subsection 1 of this section shall be allocated as follows:\n\n(1) Thirty-nine percent of the revenues shall be dedicated, upon appropriation, to the elimination of illegal solid waste disposal, to identify and prosecute persons disposing of solid waste illegally, to conduct solid waste permitting activities, to administer grants and perform other duties imposed in sections 260.200 to 260.345 and section 260.432. In addition to the thirty-nine percent of the revenues, the department may receive any annual increase in the charge during October 1, 2005, to October 1, 2027, under section 260.330 and such increases shall be used solely to fund the operating costs of the department;\n\n(2) Sixty-one percent of the revenues, except any annual increases in the charge under section 260.330 during October 1, 2005, to October 1, 2027, which shall be used solely to fund the operating costs of the department, shall be allocated to solid waste management districts. Revenues to be allocated under this subdivision shall be divided as follows: forty percent shall be allocated based on the population of each district in the latest decennial census, and sixty percent shall be allocated based on the amount of revenue generated within each district. For the purposes of this subdivision, revenue generated within each district shall be determined from the previous year's data. No more than fifty percent of the revenue allocable under this subdivision may be allocated to the districts upon approval of the department for implementation of a solid waste management plan and district operations, and at least fifty percent of the revenue allocable to the districts under this subdivision shall be allocated to the cities and counties of the district or to persons or entities providing solid waste management, waste reduction, recycling and related services in these cities and counties. Each district shall receive a minimum of seventy-five thousand dollars under this subdivision. After August 28, 2015, each district shall receive a minimum of ninety-five thousand dollars under this subdivision for district grants and district operations. Each district receiving moneys under this subdivision shall expend such moneys pursuant to a solid waste management plan required under section 260.325, and only in the case that the district is in compliance with planning requirements established by the department. Moneys shall be awarded based upon grant applications. The following criteria may be considered to establish the order of district grant priority:\n\n(a) Grants to facilities of organizations employing individuals with disabilities under sections 178.900 to 178.960 or sections 205.968 to 205.972;\n\n(b) Grants for proposals that will promote and maximize the sharing of district resources;\n\n(c) Grants for proposals which provide methods of recycling and solid waste reduction; and\n\n(d) All other grants. Any allocated district moneys remaining in any fiscal year due to insufficient or inadequate grant applications shall be reallocated for grant applications in subsequent years or for solid waste management projects other than district operations, including a district's next request for solid waste management project proposals.­­Any allocated district moneys remaining after a period of five years shall revert to the credit of the solid waste management fund created under section 260.330;\n\n­­Any allocated district moneys remaining after a period of five years shall revert to the credit of the solid waste management fund created under section 260.330;\n\n(3) Except for the amount up to one-fourth of the department's previous fiscal year expense, any remaining unencumbered funds generated under subdivision (1) of this subsection in prior fiscal years shall be reallocated under this section;\n\n(4) Funds may be made available under this subsection for the administration and grants of the used motor oil program described in section 260.253;\n\n(5) The department and the environmental improvement and energy resources authority shall conduct sample audits of grants provided under this subsection.\n\n3. In addition to the criteria listed in this section, the advisory board created in section 260.345 shall recommend criteria to be used to allocate grant moneys to districts, cities and counties. These criteria shall establish a priority for proposals which provide methods of solid waste reduction and recycling. The department shall promulgate criteria for evaluating grants by rule and regulation. Projects of cities and counties located within a district which are funded by grants under this section shall conform to the district solid waste management plan.\n\n4. The funds awarded to the districts pursuant to this section shall be used for the purposes set forth in sections 260.300 to 260.345, and shall be used in addition to existing funds appropriated by counties and cities for solid waste management and shall not supplant county or city appropriated funds.\n\n5. Once grants are approved by the solid waste management district, the district shall submit to the department the appropriate forms associated with the grant application and any supporting information to verify that appropriate public notice procedures were followed, that grant proposals were reviewed and ranked by the district, and that only eligible costs as set forth in regulations are to be funded. Within thirty days, the department shall review the grant application. If the department finds any deficiencies, or needs more information in order to evaluate the grant application, the department shall notify the district in writing. The district shall have an additional thirty days to respond to the department's request and to submit any additional information to the department. Within thirty days of receiving additional information, the department shall either approve or deny the grant application. If the department takes no action, the grant application shall be deemed approved. The department, in conjunction with the solid waste advisory board, shall review the performance of all grant recipients to ensure that grant moneys were appropriately and effectively expended to further the purposes of the grant, as expressed in the recipient's grant application. The grant application shall contain specific goals and implementation dates, and grant recipients shall be contractually obligated to fulfill same. The department may require the recipient to submit periodic reports and such other data as are necessary, both during the grant period and up to five years thereafter, to ensure compliance with this section. The department may audit the records of any recipient to ensure compliance with this section. Recipients of grants under sections 260.300 to 260.345 shall maintain such records as required by the department. If a grant recipient fails to maintain records or submit reports as required herein, refuses the department access to the records, or fails to meet the department's performance standards, the department may withhold subsequent grant payments, if any, and may compel the repayment of funds provided to the recipient pursuant to a grant.\n\n6. The department shall provide for a security interest in any machinery or equipment purchased through grant moneys distributed pursuant to this section.\n\n7. If the moneys are not transmitted to the department within the time frame established by the rule promulgated, interest shall be imposed on the moneys due the department at the rate of ten percent per annum from the prescribed due date until payment is actually made.

Duties and powers of commission — rules and regulations to be adopted, procedures — inspection fees, use of, refund, when — variances granted, when. —1. Where proven technology is available and the economic impact is reasonable, pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission, the hazardous waste management commission shall encourage that every effort is made to effectively treat, recycle, detoxify, incinerate or otherwise treat hazardous waste to be disposed of in the state of Missouri in order that such wastes are not disposed of in a manner which is hazardous to the public health and the environment. Where proven technology is available with respect to a specific hazardous waste and the economic impact is reasonable, pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission, the hazardous waste management commission shall direct that disposal of the specific hazardous wastes using land filling as the primary method is prohibited.\n\n2. The hazardous waste management commission shall, by rules and regulations, categorize hazardous waste by taking into account toxicity, persistence and degradability in nature, potential for accumulation in tissue, and other related factors such as flammability, corrosiveness and other hazardous characteristics. The commission shall by rules and regulations further establish within each category the wastes which may or may not be disposed of through alternative hazardous waste management technologies including, but not limited to, treatment facilities, incinerators, landfills, landfarms, storage facilities, surface impoundments, recycling, reuse and reduction. The commission shall specify, by rule and regulation, the frequency of inspection for each method of hazardous waste management and for the different waste categories at hazardous waste management sites. The inspection may be daily when the hazardous waste management commission deems it necessary. The hazardous waste management commission shall specify, by rule, fees to be paid to the department by owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities who have obtained, or are required to obtain, a hazardous waste facility permit and who accept, on a commercial basis for remuneration, hazardous waste from off-site sources, but not including wastes generated by the same person at other sites located in Missouri or within a metropolitan statistical area located partially in Missouri and owned or operated by the same person and transferred to the hazardous waste facility, for treatment, storage or disposal, for inspections conducted by the department to determine compliance with sections 260.350 to 260.430 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Funds derived from these inspection fees shall be used for the purpose of funding the inspection of hazardous waste facilities, as specified in subsection 3 of section 260.391. Such fees shall not exceed twelve thousand dollars per year per facility and the commission shall establish a graduated fee scale based on the volume of hazardous waste accepted with reduced fees for facilities accepting smaller volumes of hazardous waste. The department shall furnish, upon request, to the person, firm or corporation operating the hazardous waste facility a complete, full and detailed accounting of the cost of the department's inspections of the facility for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the request within forty-five days after receipt of the request. Failure to provide the accounting within forty-five days shall require the department to refund the inspection fee paid during the twelve-month-time period.\n\n3. In addition to any other powers vested in it by law, the commission shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) From time to time adopt, amend or repeal, after due notice and public hearing, standards, rules and regulations to implement, enforce and carry out the provisions of sections 260.350 to 260.430 and any required of this state by any federal hazardous waste management act and as the commission may deem necessary to provide for the safe management of hazardous wastes to protect the health of humans and the environment. In implementing this subsection, the commission shall consider the variations within this state in climate, geology, population density, quantities and types of hazardous wastes generated, availability of hazardous waste facilities and such other factors as may be relevant to the safe management of hazardous wastes. Within two years after September 28, 1977, the commission shall adopt rules and regulations including the following:\n\n(a) Rules and regulations establishing criteria and a listing for the determination of whether any waste or combination of wastes is hazardous for the purposes of sections 260.350 to 260.430, taking into account toxicity, persistence and degradability in nature, potential for accumulation in tissue, and other related factors such as flammability, corrosiveness and other hazardous characteristics;\n\n(b) Rules and regulations for the storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes;\n\n(c) Rules and regulations for the transportation, containerization and labeling of hazardous wastes, which shall be consistent with those issued by the Missouri public service commission;\n\n(d) Rules and regulations establishing standards for the issuance, modification, suspension, revocation or denial of such licenses and permits as are consistent with the purposes of sections 260.350 to 260.430;\n\n(e) Rules and regulations establishing standards and procedures for the safe operation and maintenance of hazardous waste facilities in order to protect the health of humans and other living organisms;\n\n(f) Rules and regulations listing those wastes or combinations of wastes, for which criteria have been established under paragraph (a) of this subdivision and which are not compatible and which may not be stored or disposed of together;\n\n(g) Rules and regulations establishing procedures and requirements for the reporting of the generation, storage, transportation, treatment or disposal of hazardous wastes;\n\n(2) Adopt and publish, after notice as required by the provisions of chapter 536 pertaining to administrative rulemaking, and public hearing, a state hazardous waste management plan to provide for the safe and effective management of hazardous wastes within this state. This plan shall be adopted within two years after September 28, 1977, and revised at least once every five years thereafter;\n\n(3) Hold hearings, issue notices of hearings and subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, administer oaths and take testimony as the commission deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of sections 260.350 to 260.430 or as required by any federal hazardous waste management act.

Section 6925(e), and who has submitted to the department Part A of the federal facility permit application, may continue to receive and manage hazardous wastes in the manner as specified in the Part A application, and in accordance with federal interim status requirements, until completion of the administrative disposition of a permit application submitted pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.430. The department may at any time require submission of, or the owner or operator may at any time voluntarily submit, a complete application for a permit pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.430 and commission regulations. The authority to operate pursuant to this subsection shall cease one hundred eighty days after the department has notified an owner or operator that an application for permit pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.430 must be submitted, unless within such time the owner or operator submits a completed application therefor. Upon submission of a complete application, the authority to operate pursuant to this subsection shall continue for such reasonable time as is required to complete the administrative disposition of the permit application. If a facility loses its federal interim status, or the Environmental Protection Agency requires the owner or operator to submit Part B of the federal application, the department shall notify the owner or operator that an application for a permit must be submitted pursuant to this subsection. In addition to compliance with the federal interim status requirements, the commission shall have the authority to adopt regulations requiring persons operating pursuant to this subsection to meet additional state interim status requirements.\n\n16. No person, otherwise qualified pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.430 for a license to transport hazardous wastes or for a permit to construct, substantially alter or operate a hazardous waste facility, shall be denied such license or permit on the basis of a lack of need for such transport service or such facility because of the existence of other services or facilities capable of meeting that need; except that permits for hazardous waste facilities may be denied on determination made by the department that the financial resources of the persons applying are such that the continued operation of the sites in accordance with sections 260.350 to 260.430 cannot be reasonably assured or on determination made by the department that the probable volume of business is insufficient to ensure and maintain the solvency of then existing permitted hazardous waste facilities.\n\n17. All hazardous waste landfills constructed after October 31, 1980, shall have a leachate collection system. The rules and regulations of the commission shall treat and protect all aquifers to the same level of protection.

Unless prohibited by any federal hazardous waste management act, the commission may grant individual variances from the requirements of sections 260.350 to 260.430 whenever it is found, upon presentation of adequate proof, that compliance with any provision of sections 260.350 to 260.430 or any standard, rule or regulation, order or license or permit term or condition adopted or issued hereunder will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property or in the practical closing and elimination of any lawful business, occupation or activity, in either case without sufficient corresponding benefit or advantage to the people; except that, no variance shall be granted where the effect of a variance will permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably poses a present or potential threat to the health of humans or other living organisms; and except, also, that any variance so granted shall not be so construed as to relieve the person who receives the variance from any liability imposed by other law for the commission or maintenance of a nuisance or damage to the property or rights of any person.\n\n2. In determining under what conditions and to what extent a variance may be granted, the commission shall weigh the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to those affected by the hazardous waste management practices of the applicant.\n\n3. Variances shall be granted for a period of time and under such terms and conditions as shall be specified by the commission in its order. In no event shall the variance be granted for a period of time greater than one year and shall not be renewable unless circumstances can be shown which preclude compliance within the one-year period of the variance and the renewal will not result in an unreasonable risk to the health of humans or the environment.\n\n4. (1) Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition for a variance with the department. A filing fee of fifty dollars shall be paid to the state of Missouri with each petition.\n\n(2) Upon the receipt of a request for a variance deemed substantive by the department, the department shall by mail notify all record owners of property within one mile of the outer boundaries of the site, the county, and the village, town or city within which the facility for which the variance is proposed is located. If the variance is substantive, as determined by regulation, the department shall notify the public through press release and a notice placed in a newspaper of general circulation serving the area within which the facility is located. The department shall promptly investigate the petition and make a recommendation to the commission within sixty days after the petition is received as to whether the variance should be granted or denied. The department shall promptly notify the petitioner of its action and at the same time shall issue public notice by press release or advertisement and shall notify all record owners of adjoining property by mail directed to the last known address and the village, town or city, if any, and the county which is the location of the facility for which the variance is sought.\n\n5. If the variance is deemed to be substantive, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the variance as provided in section 260.400. If the variance is deemed to be nonsubstantive, a hearing as provided in section 260.400 shall be held by the commission if requested by the petitioner within thirty days of the date of notice of the recommendation of the department. If the commission grants the variance without a hearing, the matter shall be passed upon at a public meeting no sooner than thirty days from the date of notice of the recommendation of the department, except that upon petition, filed within thirty days from the date of the recommendation, by any person aggrieved by the granting of the variance, a hearing shall be held and such petitioner shall become a party to the proceeding. In any hearing under this section the burden of proof shall be on the person petitioning for a variance.\n\n6. The commission may require the filing of a bond as a condition for the issuance of a variance in an amount determined by the commission to be sufficient to insure compliance with the terms and conditions of the variance. The bond shall be signed by the applicant as principal and by a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state of Missouri and approved by the commission. The commission may require that the bond shall remain in effect until the terms and conditions of the variance are met and the provisions of sections 260.350 to 260.430 and rules and regulations promulgated hereunder are complied with.\n\n7. Upon failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any bond or of any variance as specified by the commission, the variance may be revoked or modified or the bond may be revoked, or both, by the commission after a hearing held upon not less than thirty days written notice. The notice shall be served upon all persons who will be subjected to greater restrictions if the variance is revoked or modified or who have filed with the department a written request for notification.\n\n8. Any decision of the commission made pursuant to a hearing held under this section is subject to judicial review as provided in section 260.415.\n\n(L. 1977 H.B. 318 § 12, A.L. 1980 2d Ex. Sess.

The department shall cause investigations to be made upon the request of the commission or upon receipt of information concerning alleged violations of sections 260.350 to 260.430 or any standard, rule or regulation, order or license or permit term or condition adopted or issued hereunder, and may cause to be made any other investigations it deems advisable to further the purposes of sections 260.350 to 260.430. Violations shall include obtaining a permit hereunder by misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts.\n\n2. If, in the opinion of the department, the investigation discloses that a violation does exist, it may, by conference, conciliation or persuasion, endeavor to eliminate the violation.\n\n3. In case of the failure by conference, conciliation or persuasion to correct or remedy any claimed violation, or as required to immediately and effectively halt or eliminate any imminent or substantial threats to the health of humans or other living organisms resulting from the claimed violation, the department may order abatement of the violation or may revoke any license, or any hazardous waste transportation vehicle approval or permit which may have been issued hereunder. The department shall cause to have issued and served upon the person complained against a written notice of the order or revocation which shall include a copy of the order or revocation, which shall specify the provision of sections 260.350 to 260.430, or the standard, rule or regulation, order or license or permit term or condition adopted or issued hereunder of which the person is alleged to be in violation and a statement of the manner in which the person is alleged to violate sections 260.350 to 260.430, or the standard, rule or regulation, order or license or permit term or condition. Service may be made upon any person within or without the state by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Any person against whom the department issues an order or revocation may appeal it by filing a petition with the commission within thirty days. The appeal shall stay the enforcement of the order or revocation until final determination by the commission. The commission shall set appeals for a hearing at a time not less than thirty days after the date of the receipt of the petition. The commission may sustain, reverse or modify the department's order or revocation or may make such other orders as the commission deems appropriate under the circumstances. If any order or revocation issued by the department is not appealed within the time herein provided, the order or revocation becomes final and may be enforced as provided in section 260.425.\n\n4. Licenses and permits issued hereunder may be suspended, revoked or modified if obtained in violation of sections 260.350 to 260.430 or by misrepresentation or failing to fully disclose all relevant facts, or when required to prevent violations of any provision of sections 260.350 to 260.430 or any standard, rule or regulation, order or license or permit term or condition adopted or issued hereunder, or to protect the health of humans and other living organisms, when such action is required by a change in conditions or the existence of a condition which requires either a temporary or permanent change in the licensed or permitted hazardous waste management practices, subject to the right of appeal as set forth in section 260.410*.\n\n5. When the commission schedules a matter for hearing, the petitioner on appeal may appear at the hearing in person or by counsel, and may make oral argument, submit written brief, offer testimony and evidence and cross-examine witnesses.\n\n6. After due consideration of the record, or upon default in appearance of the petitioner at any hearing of which he has been given notice by registered or certified mail the commission shall issue and enter such final order, or make such final determination as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. It shall notify the petitioner or respondent thereof in writing by certified or registered mail.\n\n(L. 1977 H.B. 318 § 13)\n\n*Appeal procedure is provided in § 260.415.",

Administrative penalties — not to be assessed for minor violation — conference, conciliation and persuasion — rules and regulations, payment — appeal, effect — unpaid penalty, collection — time limit — review. —1. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, upon a determination by the director that a provision of sections 260.350 to 260.481 or a standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, or a term or condition of any permit has been violated, the director may issue an order assessing an administrative penalty upon the violator under this section. An administrative penalty shall not be imposed until the director has sought to resolve the violations through conference, conciliation and persuasion and shall not be imposed for minor violations of sections 260.350 to 260.481 or minor violations of any standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.481 or minor violations of any term or condition of a permit issued pursuant to sections 260.350 to 260.481. If the violation is resolved through conference, conciliation and persuasion, no administrative penalty shall be assessed unless the violation has caused, or has the potential to cause, a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. Any order assessing an administrative penalty shall state that an administrative penalty is being assessed under this section and that the person subject to the penalty may appeal as provided by this section. Any such order that fails to state the statute under which the penalty is being sought, the manner of collection or rights of appeal shall result in the state's waiving any right to collection of the penalty.\n\n2. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations for the assessment of administrative penalties. The amount of the administrative penalty assessed per day of violation for each violation under this section shall not exceed the amount of the civil penalty specified in section 260.425. Such rules shall reflect the criteria used for the administrative penalty matrix as provided for in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6928(a), Section 3008(a), and the harm or potential harm which the violation causes, or may cause, the violator's previous compliance record, and any other factors which the commission may reasonably deem relevant. An administrative penalty shall be paid within sixty days from the date of issuance of the order assessing the penalty. Any person subject to an administrative penalty may appeal to the commission in the manner provided by law. Any appeal will stay the due date of such administrative penalty until the appeal is resolved. Any person who fails to pay an administrative penalty by the final due date shall be liable to the state for a surcharge of fifteen percent of the penalty plus ten percent per annum on any amounts owed. Any administrative penalty paid pursuant to this section shall be handled in accordance with Section 7 of Article IX of the State Constitution. An action may be brought in the appropriate circuit court to collect any unpaid administrative penalty, and for attorney's fees and costs incurred directly in the collection thereof.\n\n3. An administrative penalty shall not be increased in those instances where department action, or failure to act, has caused a continuation of the violation that was a basis for the penalty. Any administrative penalty must be assessed within two years following the department's initial discovery of such alleged violation, or from the date the department in the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered such alleged violation.\n\n4. Any final order imposing an administrative penalty is subject to judicial review upon the filing of a petition pursuant to section 536.100 by any person subject to the administrative penalty.\n\n5. The state may elect to assess an administrative penalty, or, in lieu thereof, to request that the attorney general or prosecutor file an appropriate legal action seeking a civil penalty in the appropriate circuit court.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 45, A.L. 1993 S.B. 80, et al.)",

If the fees or any portion of the fees imposed by this section are not paid by the date prescribed for such payment, there shall be imposed interest upon the unpaid amount at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date prescribed for its payment until payment is actually made, all of which shall be deposited in the hazardous waste fund.\n\n6. The state treasurer is authorized to deposit all of the moneys in the hazardous waste fund in any of the qualified depositories of the state. All such deposits shall be secured in such a manner and shall be made upon such terms and conditions as are now or may hereafter be provided for by law relative to state deposits.

Emergency assistance — cost, how paid — cost statement, contents — payment, when — amount, appeal procedure — state fund to pay cost but repayment required. —1. In the event that a hazardous substance release occurs for which a political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association as defined in section 320.300 provides emergency services, the person having control over a hazardous substance shall be liable for such reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association while securing an emergency situation or cleaning up any hazardous substances. Such liability includes the cost of materials and supplies actually used to secure the emergency situation. The liability may also include the cost for contractual services which are not routinely provided by the department or political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association. Such liability shall not include the cost of normal services which otherwise would have been provided. Such liability shall not include budgeted administrative costs or the costs for duplicate services if multiple response teams are requested by the department or political subdivision unless, in the opinion of the department or political subdivision, duplication of service was required to protect the public health and environment. No later than sixty days after the completion of the cleanup of the release of a hazardous substance, the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association shall submit to the person having control of the spilled hazardous substance an itemized statement of costs provided by the political subdivision. The statement of costs shall include but not be limited to an explanation of why the costs were reasonable and necessary. The explanation shall describe how such costs were not duplicative, did not include costs for normal services that would otherwise have been provided, and why contractual services, if any, were utilized in the response to the emergency situation. Response and cleanup costs are eligible for reimbursement if the initial response and assessment to a release of a hazardous substance was based on best practices and in a manner that any prudent political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association would respond to a release of a hazardous substance. Such response and cleanup costs may also include the costs of contractual services which are not routinely provided by the department or political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association. Such costs shall not include the costs of normal services which otherwise would have been provided.\n\n2. Full payment shall be made within thirty days of receipt of the cost statement unless the person having control over the hazardous substance contests the amount of the costs pursuant to this section. If the person having control over the hazardous substance elects to contest the payment of such costs, such person shall file an appeal with the director within thirty days of receipt of the cost statement.\n\n3. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the director shall notify the parties involved of the appeal and collect such evidence from the parties involved as the director deems necessary to make a determination of reasonable cleanup costs. The burden of proof shall be on the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection district to document and justify such costs allowed under subsection 1 of this section. Within sixty days of notification of the appeal, the director shall notify the parties of his or her decision. The director shall direct the person having control over a hazardous substance to pay those costs the director finds to be reasonable and appropriate. The determination of the director shall become final thirty days after receipt of the notice by the parties involved unless prior to such date one of the involved parties files a petition for judicial review pursuant to chapter 536.\n\n4. The political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association may apply to the department for reimbursement from the hazardous waste fund created in section 260.391 for the costs for which the person having control over a hazardous substance shall be liable if the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association is able to demonstrate a need for immediate relief for such costs and believes it will not receive prompt payment from the person having control over a hazardous substance. When the liability owed to the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association by the person having control over a hazardous substance is paid, the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association shall reimburse the department for any payment it has received from the hazardous waste fund. Such reimbursement to a political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association by the department shall be paid back to the department by the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association within that time limit imposed by the department notwithstanding failure of the person having control over a hazardous substance to reimburse the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association within that time.\n\n(L. 1990 H.B. 1395 & 1448, A.L. 2000 S.B. 577, A.L. 2005 S.B. 225, A.L. 2008 S.B. 931)",

There is hereby created in the state treasury the \"Radioactive Waste Investigation Fund\". The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund and, upon appropriation, moneys in the fund shall be used solely by the department of natural resources to investigate concerns of exposure to radioactive waste. The fund shall not be used for any costs associated with clean up efforts. The fund may also accept, without limitation, funds from gifts, bequests, and devises.\n\n2. The department of natural resources shall use moneys in the radioactive waste investigation fund to develop and conduct an investigation, using sound scientific methods, for the specified area of concern. Requests for investigation may be submitted in writing to the department by local governing bodies, local community groups, or individuals located within the jurisdiction of a specified area of concern. Requests shall include a specified area of concern and any supporting documentation related to the concern. The department shall prioritize requests in the order in which they are received, except that the department may give priority to requests that are in close proximity to federally designated sites where radioactive contaminants are known or reasonably expected to exist.\n\n3. The investigation shall be performed by applicable federal or state agencies or by a qualified contractor selected by the department through a competitive bidding process. In conducting an investigation under this section, the department shall work with the applicable government agency or approved contractor, as well as local officials, to develop a sampling and analysis plan to determine if radioactive contaminants in the area of concern exceed federal standards set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for remedial action due to contamination. The investigation may include the collection of soil, dust, and water samples from the specified area. Within a residential area, this plan may include samples collected on private property only after obtaining permission from the homeowners. The samples shall be analyzed for the isotopes necessary to correlate the samples with the suspected contamination, as described in the sampling and analysis plan.\n\n4. If the department has evidence or reasonably suspects that radioactive contaminants are located on property owned by a governmental agency, regardless of whether the property is accessible to the public that will not grant access to collect samples, the department may seek a warrant to access the property to collect any samples authorized under this section.\n\n5. Within forty-five days of receiving the final sampling results, the department shall report the results to the attorney general and make the finalized report and testing results publicly available on the department's website.\n\n6. The transfer to the fund from the hazardous waste fund shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars per fiscal year. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (7) of subsection 1 of section 260.391 to the contrary, and beginning August 28, 2025, moneys to the fund shall no longer be transferred from the hazardous waste fund and shall be transferred to the fund from the general revenue fund not to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars per fiscal year, unless any excess is authorized by the general assembly. Any moneys transferred from the hazardous waste fund remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall revert to the credit of the hazardous waste fund. Moneys received from general revenue, gifts, bequests, devises, or any other source shall remain in the radioactive waste investigation fund.\n\n7. The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n8. The department shall seek reimbursement of expenses incurred during radioactive waste testing from any federal agency responsible for the site.\n\n(L. 2018 H.B. 1355 merged with S.B. 659 merged with S.B. 782, A.L. 2025 H.B. 516, et al.)",

Membership authorized — compact — purposes. —The \"Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nTHE MIDWEST INTERSTATE LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE COMPACT\n\nARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE\n\nThere is created the \"Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact\".\n\nThe states party to this compact recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, as amended by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, 42 U.S.C. 2021b to j, has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposing of such waste. The party states acknowledge that the Congress declared that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of certain defense activities of the federal government or federal research and development activities. The party states also recognize that the disposal of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis; and, that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.\n\na. It is the policy of the party states to enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste disposal compact for the purpose of:\n\n1. Providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort;\n\n2. Providing sufficient facilities for the proper disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;\n\n3. Protecting the health and safety of the citizens of the region;\n\n4. Limiting the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently dispose of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;\n\n5. Encouraging source reduction and the environmentally sound treatment of waste that is generated to minimize the amount of waste to be disposed of;\n\n6. Ensuring that the costs, expenses, liabilities, and obligations of low-level radioactive waste disposal are paid by generators and other persons who use compact facilities to dispose of their waste;\n\n7. Ensuring that the obligations of low-level radioactive waste disposal that are the responsibility of the party states are shared equitably among them;\n\n8. Ensuring that the party states that comply with the terms of this compact and fulfill their obligations under it share equitably in the benefits of the successful disposal of low-level radioactive waste; and\n\n9. Ensuring the environmentally sound, economical, and secure disposal of low-level radioactive wastes.\n\nb. Implicit in the congressional consent to this compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the compact commission and the individual party states to this compact by:\n\n1. Expeditious enforcement of federal rules, regulations and laws;\n\n2. Imposition of sanctions against those found to be in violation of federal rules, regulations and laws; and\n\n3. Timely inspection of their licensees to determine their compliance with these rules, regulations and laws.\n\nARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\na.\"Care\"means the continued observation of a facility after closing for the purposes of detecting a need for maintenance, ensuring environmental safety, and determining compliance with applicable licensure and regulatory requirements and including the correction of problems which are detected as a result of that observation.\n\nb.\"Close\",\"Closed\", or\"Closing\"means that the compact facility with respect to which any of those terms is used has ceased to accept waste for disposal.\"Permanently closed\"means that the compact facility with respect to which the term is used has ceased to accept waste because it has operated for twenty years or a longer period of time as authorized by Article VI.i. of this compact, its capacity has been reached, the commission has authorized it to close pursuant to Article III.h.7. of this compact, the host state of such facility has withdrawn from the compact or had its membership revoked, or this compact has been dissolved.\n\nc.\"Commission\"means the Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission.\n\nd.\"Compact facility\"means a waste disposal facility that is located within the region and that is established by a party state pursuant to the designation of that state as a host state by the commission.\n\ne.\"Development\"includes the characterization of potential sites for a waste disposal facility, siting of such a facility, licensing of such a facility, and other actions taken by a host state prior to the commencement of construction of such a facility to fulfill its obligations as a host state.\n\nf.\"Disposal\", with regard to low-level radioactive waste, means the permanent isolation of that waste in accordance with the requirements established by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the licensing agreement state.\n\ng.\"Disposal plan\"means the plan adopted by the commission for the disposal of waste within the region.\n\nh.\"Facility\"means a parcel of land or site, together with the structures, equipment and improvements on or appurtenant to the land or site, which is or has been used for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, which is being developed for that purpose, or upon which the construction of improvements or installation of equipment is occurring for that purpose.\n\ni.\"Final decision\"means a final action of the commission determining the legal rights, duties or privileges of any person. \"Final decision\" does not include preliminary, procedural or intermediate actions by the commission, actions regulating the internal administration of the commission, or actions of the commission to enter into or refrain from entering into contracts or agreements with vendors to provide goods or services to the commission.\n\nj.\"Generator\"means a person who first produces low-level radioactive waste, including, without limitation, any person who does so in the course of or incident to manufacturing, power generation, processing, waste treatment, waste storage, medical diagnosis and treatment, research, or other industrial or commercial activity.

THE COMMISSION\n\na. There is created the \"Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission\". The commission consists of one voting member from each party state. The governor of each party state shall notify the commission in writing of its member and any alternates. An alternate may act on behalf of the member only in that member's absence. The method for selection and the expenses of each commission member shall be the responsibility of the member's respective state.\n\nb. Each commission member is entitled to one vote. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this compact, an action of the commission is binding if a majority of the total membership casts its vote in the affirmative. A party state may direct its member or alternate member of the commission how to vote or not vote on matters before the commission.\n\nc. The commission shall elect annually from among its members a chairperson. The commission shall adopt and publish, in convenient form, bylaws, and policies which are not inconsistent with this compact, including procedures for the use of binding arbitration under Article VI.o. of this compact and procedures which substantially conform with the provisions of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. sections 500 to 559) in regard to notice, conduct and recording of meetings; access by the public to records; provision of information to the public; conduct of adjudicatory hearings; and issuance of decisions.\n\nd. The commission shall meet at least once annually and shall also meet upon the call of the chairperson or any other commission member.\n\ne. All meetings of the commission shall be open to the public with reasonable advance notice. The commission may, by majority vote, close a meeting to the public for the purpose of considering sensitive personnel or legal strategy matters. However, all commission actions and decisions shall be made in open meetings and appropriately recorded.\n\nf. The commission may establish advisory committees for the purpose of advising the commission on any matters pertaining to waste management.\n\ng. The office of the commission shall be in a party state. The commission may appoint or contract for and compensate such limited staff necessary to carry out its duties and functions. The staff shall have the responsibilities and authority delegated to it by the commission in its bylaws. The staff shall serve at the commission's pleasure with the exception that staff hired as the result of securing federal funds shall be hired and governed under applicable federal statutes and regulations. In selecting any staff, the commission shall assure that the staff has adequate experience and formal training to carry out the functions assigned to it by the commission.\n\nh. The commission may do any or all of the following:\n\n1. Appear as an intervenor or party in interest before any court of law or any federal, state or local agency, board or commission in any matter related to waste management. In order to represent its views, the commission may arrange for any expert testimony, reports, evidence or other participation.\n\n2. Review any emergency closing of a compact facility, determine the appropriateness of that closing, and take whatever lawful actions are necessary to ensure that the interests of the region are protected.\n\n3. Take any action which is appropriate and necessary to perform its duties and functions as provided in this compact.\n\n4. Approve the disposal of naturally occurring and accelerator produced radioactive material at a compact facility. The commission shall not approve the acceptance of such material without first making an explicit determination of the effect of the new waste stream on the compact facility's maximum capacity. Such approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the commission, including the affirmative vote of the member from the host state of the compact facility that would accept the material for disposal. Any such host state may, at any time, rescind its vote granting the approval and, thereafter, additional naturally occurring and accelerator produced radioactive material shall not be disposed of at a compact facility unless the disposal is again approved. All provisions of this compact apply to the disposal of naturally occurring and accelerator produced radioactive material that has been approved for disposal at a compact waste facility pursuant to Article III.h.4. of this compact.\n\n5. Enter into contracts in order to perform its duties and functions as provided in this compact.\n\n6. When approved by the commission, with the member from each host state in which an affected compact facility is operating or being developed or constructed voting in the affirmative, enter into agreements to do any of the following:\n\n(a) Import for disposal within the region, waste generated outside the region;\n\n(b) Export for disposal outside the region, waste generated inside the region;\n\n(c) Dispose of waste generated within the region at a facility within the region that is not a compact facility.\n\n7. Authorize a host state to permanently close a compact facility located within its borders earlier than otherwise would be required by Article VI.i. of this compact. Such a closing requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the commission, including the affirmative vote of the member from the state in which the affected compact facility is located.\n\ni. The commission shall do all of the following:\n\n1. Submit an annual report to, and otherwise communicate with, the governors and the appropriate officers of the legislative bodies of the party states regarding the activities of the commission.\n\n2. Adopt and amend, by a two-thirds vote of the membership, in accordance with the procedures and criteria developed pursuant to Article IV of this compact, a regional disposal plan which designates host states for the establishment of needed compact facilities.\n\n3. Adopt an annual budget.\n\n4. Establish and implement a procedure for determining the capacity of a compact facility. The capacity of a compact facility shall be established as soon as reasonably practical after the host state of the facility is designated and shall not be changed thereafter without the consent of the host state. The capacity of a compact facility shall be based on the projected volume, radioactive characteristics, or both, of the waste to be disposed of at the facility during the period set forth in Article VI.i. of this compact.\n\n5. Provide a host state with funds necessary to pay reasonable development expenses incurred by the host state after it is designated to host a compact facility.\n\n6. Establish and implement procedures for making payments from the remedial action fund provided for in Article III.p. of this compact.\n\n7. Establish and implement procedures to investigate any complaint joined in by two or more party states regarding another party state's performance of its obligations under this compact.\n\n8. Adopt policies promoting source reduction and the environmentally sound treatment of waste in order to minimize the amount of waste to be disposed of at compact facilities.\n\n9. Establish and implement procedures for obtaining information from generators regarding the volume and characteristics of waste projected to be disposed of at compact facilities and regarding generator activities with respect to source reduction, recycling and treatment of waste.\n\n10. Prepare annual reports regarding the volume and characteristics of waste projected to be disposed of at compact facilities.\n\nj. Funding for the commission shall be provided as follows:\n\n1. When no compact facility is operating, the commission may assess fees to be collected from generators of waste in the region. The fees shall be reasonable and equitable. The commission shall establish and implement procedures for assessing and collecting the fees. The procedures may allow the assessing of fees against less than all generators of waste in the region; provided that if fees are assessed against less than all generators of waste in the region, generators paying the fees shall be reimbursed the amount of the fees, with reasonable interest, out of the revenues of operating compact facilities.\n\n2. When a compact facility is operating, funding for the commission shall be provided through a surcharge collected by the host state as part of the fee system provided for in Article VI.j. of this compact. The surcharge to be collected by the host state shall be determined by the commission and shall be reasonable and equitable.\n\n3. In the aggregate, the fees or surcharges, as the case may be, shall be no more than is necessary to:\n\n(a) Cover the annual budget of the commission;\n\n(b) Provide a host state with the funds necessary to pay reasonable development expenses incurred by the host state after it is designated to host a compact facility;\n\n(c) Provide moneys for deposit in the remedial action fund established pursuant to Article III.p. of this compact; and\n\n(d) Provide moneys to be added to an inadequately funded long-term care fund as provided in Article VI.o. of this compact.\n\nk. Financial statements of the commission shall be prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles. The commission shall contract with an independent certified public accountant to annually audit its financial statements and to submit an audit report to the commission. The audit report shall be made a part of the annual report of the commission required by Article III of this compact.\n\nl. The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions and may utilize and dispose of any donations, grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation. The nature, amount and condition, if any, attendant upon any donation or grant accepted or received by the commission together with the identity of the donor, grantor or lender, shall be detailed in the annual report of the commission.\n\nm. The commission is a legal entity separate and distinct from the party states. Members of the commission and its employees are not personally liable for actions taken by them in their official capacity. The commission is not liable or otherwise responsible for any costs, expenses or liabilities resulting from the development, construction, operation, regulation, closing or long-term care of any compact facility or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any contract or agreement entered into by the commission under Article III.h.6. of this compact. Nothing in Article III.m. of this compact relieves the commission of its obligations under Article III of this compact or under contracts to which it is a party. Any liabilities of the commission are not liabilities of the party states.\n\nn. Final decisions of the commission shall be made, and shall be subject to judicial review, in accordance with all of the following conditions:\n\n1. Every final decision shall be made at an open meeting of the commission. Before making a final decision, the commission shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the matter to be decided. Each final decision shall be reduced to writing and shall set forth the commission's reasons for making the decision.\n\n2. Before making a final decision, the commission may conduct an adjudicatory hearing on the proposed decision.\n\n3. Judicial review of a final decision shall be initiated by filing a petition in the United States District Court for the district in which the person seeking the review resides or in which the commission's office is located not later than sixty days after issuance of the commission's written decision. Concurrently with filing the petition for review with the court, the petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition on the commission. Within five days after receiving a copy of the petition, the commission shall mail a copy of it to each party state and to all other persons who have notified the commission of their desire to receive copies of such petitions. Any failure of the commission to so mail copies of the petition does not affect the jurisdiction of the reviewing court. Except as otherwise provided in Article III.n.3. of this compact, standing to obtain judicial review of final decisions of the commission and the form and scope of the review are subject to and governed by 5 U.S.C.A. 706.\n\n4. If a party state seeks judicial review of a final decision of the commission that does any of the following, the facts shall be subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court unless trial de novo of the facts is affirmatively waived in writing by the party state:\n\n(a) Imposes financial penalties on a party state;\n\n(b) Suspends the right of a party state to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at a compact facility or at a noncompact facility made available to the region by an agreement entered into by the commission under Article III.h.6. of this compact;\n\n(c) Terminates the designation of a party state as a host state;\n\n(d) Revokes the membership of a party state in this compact;\n\n(e) Establishes the amounts of money that a party state that has withdrawn from this compact or had its membership in this compact revoked is required to pay under article VIII.e. of this compact.­­Any such trial de novo of the facts shall be governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n­­Any such trial de novo of the facts shall be governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n5. Preliminary, procedural or intermediate actions by the commission that precede a final decision are subject to review only in conjunction with review of the final decision.\n\n6. Except as provided in Article III.n.5. of this compact, actions of the commission that are not final decisions are not subject to judicial review.\n\no. Unless approved by a majority of the commission, with the member from each host state in which an affected compact facility is operating or is being developed or constructed voting in the affirmative, no person shall do any of the following:\n\n1. Import waste generated outside the region for management within the region;\n\n2. Export waste generated within the region for disposal outside the region;\n\n3. Manage waste generated outside the region at a facility within the region;\n\n4. Dispose of waste generated within the region at a facility within the region that is not a compact facility.\n\np. The commission shall establish a remedial action fund to pay the costs of reasonable remedial actions taken by a party state if an event results from the development, construction, operation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility that poses a threat to human health, safety or welfare or to the environment. The amount of the remedial action fund shall be adequate to pay the costs of all reasonably foreseeable remedial actions. A party state shall notify the commission as soon as reasonably practical after the occurrence of any event that may require the party state to take a remedial action. The failure of a party state to so notify the commission does not limit the rights of the party state under Article III.p. of this compact. If the moneys in the remedial action fund are inadequate to pay the costs of reasonable remedial actions, the amount of the deficiency is a liability with respect to which generators shall provide indemnification under Article VII.g. of this compact. Generators who provide the required indemnification have the rights of contribution provided in Article VII.g. of this compact. Article III.p. of this compact applies to any remedial action taken by a party state regardless of whether the party state takes the remedial action on its own initiative or because it is required to do so by a court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction.\n\nq. If the commission makes payment from*the remedial action fund provided for in Article III.p. of this compact, the commission is entitled to obtain reimbursement under applicable rules of law from any person who is responsible for the event giving rise to the remedial action. Such reimbursement may be obtained from a party state only if the event giving rise to the remedial action resulted from the activities of that party state as a generator of waste.\n\nr. If this compact is dissolved, all moneys held by the commission shall be used first to pay for any ongoing or reasonably anticipated remedial actions. Any remaining moneys shall be distributed in a fair and equitable manner to those party states that have operating or closed compact facilities within their borders and shall be added to the long-term care funds maintained by those party states.\n\nARTICLE IV. REGIONAL DISPOSAL PLAN\n\nThe commission shall adopt and periodically update a regional disposal plan designed to ensure the safe and efficient disposal of waste generated within the region. In adopting a regional waste disposal plan, the commission shall do all of the following:\n\na. Adopt procedures for determining, consistent with considerations for public health and safety, the type and number of compact facilities which are presently necessary and which are projected to be necessary to dispose of waste generated within the region;\n\nb. Develop and adopt procedures and criteria for identifying a party state as a host state for a compact facility. In developing these criteria, the commission shall consider all of the following:\n\n1. The health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the party states;\n\n2. The existence of compact facilities within each party state;\n\n3. The minimization of waste transportation;\n\n4. The volumes and types of wastes generated within each party state;\n\n5. The environmental impacts on the air, land and water resources of the party states; and\n\n6. The economic impacts on the party states.\n\nc. Conduct such hearings, and obtain such reports, studies, evidence and testimony required by its approved procedures prior to identifying a party state as a host state for a needed compact facility;\n\nd. Prepare a draft disposal plan and any update thereof, including procedures, criteria and host states, which shall be made available in a convenient form to the public for comment. Upon the request of a party state, the commission shall conduct a public hearing in that state prior to the adoption or update of the disposal plan. The disposal plan and any update thereof shall include the commission's response to public and party state comment.\n\nARTICLE V. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF PARTY STATES\n\na. Each party state shall act in good faith in the performance of acts and courses of conduct which are intended to ensure the provision of facilities for regional availability and usage in a manner consistent with this compact.\n\nb. Except for waste attributable to radioactive material or waste imported into the region in order to render the material or waste amenable to transportation, storage, disposal or recovery, or in order to convert the waste or material to another usable material, or to reduce it in volume or otherwise treat it, each party state has the right to have all wastes generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities subject to the payment of all fees established by the host state under Article VI.j. of this compact and to the provisions contained in Articles VI.l., VI.s., VIII.d., IX.d. and X of this compact. All party states have an equal right of access to any facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, subject to the provisions of Articles VI.l., VI.s., VIII.d. and X of this compact.\n\nc. If a party state's right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities, or at any noncompact facility made available to the region by an agreement entered into by the commission under Article III.h.6. of this compact, is suspended, no waste generated within its borders by any person shall be disposed of at any such facility during the period of the suspension.\n\nd. To the extent permitted by federal law, each party state may enforce any applicable federal and state laws, regulations and rules pertaining to the packaging and transportation of waste generated within or passing through its borders. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a party state to enter into any agreement with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\ne. Each party state shall provide to the commission any data and information the commission requires to implement its responsibilities. Each party state shall establish the capability to obtain any data and information required by the commission.\n\nf. If, notwithstanding the sovereign immunity provision in Article VII.f.1. and the indemnification provided for in Articles III.p., VI.o. and VII.g. of this compact, a party state incurs a cost as a result of an inadequate remedial action fund of an exhausted long-term care fund, or incurs a liability as a result of an action described in Article VII.f.1. and not described in Article VII.f.2. of this compact, the cost or liability shall be the pro rata obligation of each party state and each state that has withdrawn from this compact or had its membership in this compact revoked. The commission shall determine each state's pro rata obligation in a fair and equitable manner based on the amount of waste from each such state that has been or is projected to be disposed of at the compact facility with respect to which the cost or liability to be shared was incurred. No state shall be obligated to pay the pro rata obligation of any other state.­­The pro rata obligations provided for in Article V.f. of this compact do not result in the creation of state debt. Rather, the pro rata obligations are contractual obligations that shall be enforced by only the commission or an affected party state.\n\n­­The pro rata obligations provided for in Article V.f. of this compact do not result in the creation of state debt. Rather, the pro rata obligations are contractual obligations that shall be enforced by only the commission or an affected party state.\n\ng. If the party states make payment pursuant to Article V.f. of this compact, the surcharge or fee provided for in Article III.j. of this compact shall be used to collect the funds necessary to reimburse the party states for those payments. The commission shall determine the time period over which reimbursement shall take place.\n\nARTICLE VI. DEVELOPMENT, OPERATION AND CLOSING OF COMPACT FACILITIES\n\na. Any party state may volunteer to become a host state, and the commission may designate that state as a host state.\n\nb. If not all compact facilities required by the regional disposal plan are not developed pursuant to Article VI.a. of this compact, the commission may designate a host state.\n\nc. After a state is designated a host state by the commission, it is responsible for the timely development and operation of the compact facility it is designated to host. The development and operation of the compact facility shall not conflict with applicable federal and host state laws, rules and regulations, provided that the laws, rules and regulations of a host state and its political subdivisions shall not prevent, nor shall they be applied so as to prevent, the host state's discharge of the obligation set forth in Article VI.c. of this compact. The obligation set forth in Article VI.c. of this compact is contingent upon the discharge by the commission of its obligation set forth in Article III.i.5. of this compact.\n\nd. If a party state designated as a host state fails to discharge the obligations imposed upon it by Article VI.c. of this compact, its host state designation may be terminated by a two-thirds vote of the commission with the member from the host state of any then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative. A party state whose host state designation has been terminated has failed to fulfill its obligations as a host state and is subject to the provisions of Article VIII.d. of this compact.\n\ne. Any party state designated as a host state may request the commission to relieve that state of the responsibility to serve as a host state. Except as set forth in Article IV.d. of this compact, the commission may relieve a party state of its responsibility only upon a showing by the requesting party state that, based upon criteria established by the commission that are consistent with any applicable federal criteria, no feasible potential compact facility site exists within its borders. A party state relieved of its host state responsibility shall repay to the commission any funds provided to that state by the commission for the development of a compact facility, and also shall pay to the commission the amount the commission determines is necessary to ensure that the commission and the other party states do not incur financial loss as a result of the state being relieved of its host state responsibility. Any funds so paid to the commission with respect to the financial loss of the other party states shall be distributed forthwith by the commission to the party states that would otherwise incur the loss. In addition, until the state relieved of its responsibility is again designated as a host state and a compact facility located in that state begins operating, it shall annually pay to the commission, for deposit in the remedial action fund, an amount the commission determines is fair and equitable in light of the fact the state has been relieved of the responsibility to host a compact facility, but continues to enjoy the benefits of being a member of this compact.\n\nf. The host state shall select the technology for the compact facility. If requested by the commission, information regarding the technology selected by the host state shall be submitted to the commission for its review. The commission may require the host state to make changes in the technology selected by the host state if the commission demonstrates that the changes do not decrease the protection of air, land and water resources and the health and safety of all people who may be affected by the facility. If requested by the host state, any commission decision requiring the host state to make changes in the technology shall be preceded by an adjudicatory hearing in which the commission shall have the burden of proof.\n\ng. A host state may assign to a private contractor the responsibility, in whole or in part, to develop, construct, operate, close or provide long-term care for a compact facility. Assignment of such responsibility by a host state to a private contractor does not relieve the host state of any responsibility imposed upon it by this compact. A host state may secure indemnification from the contractor for any costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by the host state resulting from the development, construction, operation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility.\n\nh. To the extent permitted by federal and state law, a host state shall regulate and license any facility within its borders and ensure the long-term care of that facility.\n\ni. A host state shall accept waste for disposal for a period of twenty years from the date the compact facility in the host state becomes operational, or until its capacity has been reached, whichever occurs first. At any time before the compact facility closes, the host state and the commission may enter into an agreement to extend the period during which the host state is required to accept such waste or to increase the capacity of the compact facility. Except as specifically authorized by Article VI.l.4. of this compact, the twenty-year period shall not be extended, and the capacity of the facility shall not be increased, without the consent of the affected host state and the commission.\n\nj. A host state shall establish a system of fees to be collected from the users of any compact facility within its borders. The fee system, and the costs paid through the system, shall be reasonable and equitable. The fee system shall be subject to the commission's approval. The fee system shall provide the host state with sufficient revenue to pay costs associated with the compact facility, including, but not limited to, operation, closing, long-term care, debt service, legal costs, local impact assistance and local financial incentives. The fee system also shall be used to collect the surcharge provided in Article III.j.2. of this compact. The fee system shall include incentives for source reduction and shall be based on the hazard of the waste as well as the volume.\n\nk. A host state shall ensure that a compact facility located within its borders that is permanently closed is properly cared for so as to ensure protection of air, land and water resources and the health and safety of all people who may be affected by the facility.\n\nl. The development of subsequent compact facilities shall be as follows:\n\n1. No compact facility shall begin operating until the commission designates the host state of the next compact facility.\n\n2. The following actions shall be taken by the state designated to host the next compact facility within the specified number of years after the compact facility it is intended to replace begins operation:\n\n(a) Within three years, enact legislation providing for the development of the next compact facility;\n\n(b) Within seven years, initiate site characterization investigations and tests to determine licensing suitability for the next compact facility;\n\n(c) Within eleven years, submit a license application for the next compact facility that the responsible licensing authority deems complete.­­If a host state fails to take any of these actions within the specified time, all waste generated by any person within that state shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility, and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, until the action is taken. Denial of access may be rescinded by the commission, with the member from the host state of the then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative. A host state that fails to take any of these actions within the specified time has failed to fulfill its obligations as a host state and is subject to the provisions of Articles VI.d. and VIII.d. of this compact.\n\n­­If a host state fails to take any of these actions within the specified time, all waste generated by any person within that state shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility, and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, until the action is taken. Denial of access may be rescinded by the commission, with the member from the host state of the then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative. A host state that fails to take any of these actions within the specified time has failed to fulfill its obligations as a host state and is subject to the provisions of Articles VI.d. and VIII.d. of this compact.\n\n3. Within fourteen years after any compact facility begins operating, the state designated to host the next compact facility shall have obtained a license from the responsible licensing authority to construct and operate the compact facility the state has been designated to host. If the license is not obtained within the specified time, all waste generated by any person within the state designated to host the next compact facility shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility, and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, until the license is obtained. The state designated to host the next compact facility shall have failed in its obligations as a host state and shall be subject to Articles VI.d. and VIII.d. of this compact. In addition, at the sole option of the host state of the then operating compact facility, all waste generated by any person within any party state that has not fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility, and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, until the license is obtained. Denial of access may be rescinded by the commission, with the member from the host state of the then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative.\n\n4. If twenty years after a compact facility begins operating, the next compact facility is not ready to begin operating, the state designated to host the next compact facility shall have failed in its obligation as a host state and shall be subject to Articles VI.d. and VIII.d. of this compact. If at the time the capacity of the then operating compact facility has been reached, or twenty years after the facility began operating, whichever occurs first, the next compact facility is not ready to begin operating, the host state of the then operating compact facility, without the consent of any other party state or the commission, may continue to operate the facility until a compact facility in the next host state is ready to begin operating. During any such period of continued operation of a compact facility, all waste generated by any person within the state designated to host the next compact facility shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact. In addition, during such period, at the sole option of the host state of the then operating compact facility, all waste generated by any person within any party state that has not fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact shall be denied access to the then operating compact facility and to any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact. Denial of access may be rescinded by the commission, with the member from the host state of the then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative. The provisions of Article VI.l.4. of this compact shall not apply if their application is inconsistent with an agreement between the host state of the then operating compact facility and the commission as authorized in Article VI.i. of this compact, or inconsistent with Article VI.p. or q. of this compact.\n\n5. During any period that access is denied for waste disposal pursuant to Article VI.l.2.3. or 4. of this compact, the party state designated to host the next compact disposal facility shall pay to the host state of the then operating compact facility an amount the commission determines is reasonably necessary to ensure that the host state, or any agency or political subdivision thereof, does not incur financial loss as a result of the denial of access.\n\n6. The commission may modify any of the requirements contained in Articles VI.l.2. and 3. of this compact if it finds that circumstances have changed so that the requirements are unworkable or unnecessarily rigid or no longer serve to ensure the timely development of a compact facility. The commission may adopt such a finding by a two-thirds vote, with the member from the host state of the then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative.\n\nm. This compact shall not prevent an emergency closing of a compact facility by a host state to protect air, land and water resources and the health and safety of all people who may be affected by the facility. A host state that has an emergency closing of a compact facility shall notify the commission in writing within three working days of its action and shall, within thirty working days of its action, demonstrate justification for the closing.\n\nn. A party state that has fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact shall not again be designated a host state of a compact facility without its consent until each party state has been designated to host a compact facility and has fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact or has been relieved under Article VI.e. of this compact of its responsibility to serve as a host state.\n\no. Each host state of a compact facility shall establish a long-term care fund to pay for monitoring, security, maintenance and repair of the facility after it is permanently closed. The expenses of administering the long-term care fund shall be paid out of the fund. The fee system established by the host state that establishes a long-term care fund shall be used to collect moneys in amounts that are adequate to pay for all long-term care of the compact facility. The moneys shall be deposited into the long-term care fund. Except where the matter is resolved through arbitration, the amount to be collected through the fee system for deposit into the fund shall be determined through an agreement between the commission and the host state establishing the fund. Not less than three years, nor more than five years, before the compact facility it is designated to host is scheduled to begin operating, the host state shall propose to the commission the amount to be collected through the fee system for deposit into the fund. If, one hundred eighty days after such proposal is made to the commission, the host state and the commission have not agreed, either the commission or the host state may require the matter to be decided through binding arbitration. The method of administration of the fund shall be determined by the host state establishing the long-term care fund, provided that moneys in the fund shall be used only for the purposes set forth in Article VI.o. of this compact and shall be invested in accordance with the standards applicable to trustees under the laws of the host state establishing the fund. If, after a compact facility is closed, the commission determines the long-term care fund established with respect to that facility is not adequate to pay for all long-term care for that facility, the commission shall collect and pay over to the host state of the closed facility, for deposit into the long-term care fund, an amount determined by the commission to be necessary to make the amount in the fund adequate to pay for all long-term care of the facility. If a long-term care fund is exhausted and long-term care expenses for the facility with respect to which the fund was created have been reasonably incurred by the host state of the facility, those expenses are a liability with respect to which generators shall provide indemnification as provided in Article VII.g. of this compact. Generators that provide indemnification shall have contribution rights as provided in Article VII.g. of this compact.\n\np. A host state that withdraws from the compact or has its membership revoked shall immediately and permanently close any compact facility located within its borders, except that the commission and a host state may enter into an agreement under which the host state may continue to operate, as a noncompact facility, a facility within its borders that, before the host state withdrew or had its membership revoked, was a compact facility.\n\nq. If this compact is dissolved, the host state of any then operating compact facility shall immediately and permanently close the facility, provided that a host state may continue to operate a compact facility or resume operating a previously closed compact facility, as a noncompact facility, subject to all of the following requirements:\n\n1. The host state shall pay to the other party states the portion of the funds provided to that state by the commission for the development, construction, operation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility that is fair and equitable, taking into consideration the period of time the compact facility located in that state was in operation and the amount of waste disposed of at the facility, provided that a host state that has fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact shall not be required to make such payment;\n\n2. The host state shall physically segregate waste disposed of at the facility after this compact is dissolved from waste disposed of at the facility before this compact is dissolved;\n\n3. The host state shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party states from all costs, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, caused by operating the facility after this compact is dissolved, provided that this indemnification and hold harmless obligation shall not apply to costs, liabilities and expenses resulting from the activities of a host state as a generator of waste;\n\n4. Moneys in the long-term care fund established by the host state that are attributable to the operation of the facility before this compact is dissolved, and investment earnings thereon, shall be used only to pay the cost of monitoring, securing, maintaining or repairing that portion of the facility used for the disposal of waste before this compact is dissolved. Such moneys and investment earnings, and any moneys added to the long-term care fund through a distribution authorized by Article III.r. of this compact, also may be used to pay the cost of any remedial action made necessary by an event resulting from the disposal of waste at the facility before this compact is dissolved.\n\nr. Financial statements of a compact facility shall be prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles. The commission may require the financial statements to be audited on an annual basis by a firm of certified public accountants selected and paid by the commission.\n\ns. Waste may be accepted for disposal at a compact facility only if the generator of the waste has signed, and there is on file with the commission, an agreement to provide indemnification to a party state, or employee of that state, for all of the following:\n\n1. Any cost of a remedial action described in Article III.p. of this compact that, due to inadequacy of the remedial action fund, is not paid as set forth in that provision;\n\n2. Any expense for long-term care described in Article VI.o. of this compact that, due to exhaustion of the long-term care fund, is not paid as set forth in that provision;\n\n3. Any liability for damages to persons, property or the environment incurred by a party state, or employee of that state while acting within the scope of employment, resulting from the development, construction, operation, regulation, closing or long-term of a compact facility, or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, or any other matter arising from this compact. The agreement also shall require generators to indemnify the party state or employee against all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in defending any action for such damages. This indemnification shall not extend to liability based on any of the following:\n\n(a) The activities of the party states as generators of waste;\n\n(b) The obligations of the party states to each other and the commission imposed by this compact or other contracts related to the disposal of waste under this compact;\n\n(c) Activities of a host state or employees thereof that are grossly negligent or willful and wanton.­­The agreement shall provide that the indemnification obligation of generators shall be joint and several, except that the indemnification obligation of the party states with respect to their activities as generators of waste shall not be joint and several, but instead shall be prorated according to the amount of waste that each state had disposed of at the compact facility giving rise to the liability. Such proration shall be calculated as of the date of the event giving rise to the liability. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the commission with the member from the host state of any then operating compact facility voting in the affirmative. Among generators there shall be rights of contribution based on equitable principles, and generators shall have rights of contribution against any other person responsible for such damages under common law, statute, rule or regulation, provided that a party state that through its own activities did not generate any waste disposed of at the compact facility giving rise to the liability, an employee of such a party state, and the commission shall have no such contribution obligation. The commission may waive the requirement that the party state sign and file such an indemnification agreement as a condition to being able to dispose of waste generated as a result of the party state's activities. Such a waiver shall not relieve a party state of the indemnification obligation imposed by Article VII.g. of this compact.\n\n­­The agreement shall provide that the indemnification obligation of generators shall be joint and several, except that the indemnification obligation of the party states with respect to their activities as generators of waste shall not be joint and several, but instead shall be prorated according to the amount of waste that each state had disposed of at the compact facility giving rise to the liability.

Such a waiver shall not relieve a party state of the indemnification obligation imposed by Article VII.g. of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VII. OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\na. Nothing in this compact:\n\n1. Abrogates or limits the applicability of any act of the Congress or diminishes or otherwise impairs the jurisdiction of any federal agency expressly conferred thereon by the Congress;\n\n2. Prevents the enforcement of any other law of a party state which is not inconsistent with this compact;\n\n3. Prohibits any generator from storing or treating, on its own premises, waste generated by it within the region;\n\n4. Affects any administrative or judicial proceeding pending on the effective date of this compact;\n\n5. Alters the relations between and the respective internal responsibility of the government of a party state and its subdivisions;\n\n6. Affects the generation, treatment, storage or disposal of waste generated by the atomic energy defense activities of the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, or successor agencies, or federal research and development activities as described in 42 U.S.C. 2021;\n\n7. Affects the rights and powers of any party state or its political subdivisions, to the extent not inconsistent with this compact, to regulate and license any facility or the transportation of waste within its borders;\n\n8. Requires a party state to enter into any agreement with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission; or\n\n9. Limits, expands or otherwise affects the authority of a state to regulate low-level radioactive waste classified by any agency of the United States government as \"below regulatory concern\" or otherwise exempt from federal regulation.\n\nb. If a court of the United States finally determines that a law of a party state conflicts with this compact, this compact shall prevail to the extent of the conflict. The commission shall not commence an action seeking such a judicial determination unless commencement of the action is approved by a two-thirds vote of the membership of the commission.\n\nc. Except as authorized by this compact, no law, rule or regulation of a party state or of any of its subdivisions or instrumentalities may be applied in a manner which discriminates against the generators of another party state.\n\nd. Except as provided in Articles III.m. and VII.f. of this compact, no provision of this compact shall be construed to eliminate or reduce in any way the liability or responsibility, whether arising under common law, statute, rule or regulation, of any person for penalties, fines or damages to persons, property or the environment resulting from the development, construction, operation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility, or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, or any other matter arising from this compact. The provisions of this compact shall not alter otherwise applicable laws relating to compensation of employees for workplace injuries.\n\ne. Except as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1251(A), the district courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction to decide cases arising under this compact. Article VII.e. of this compact does not apply to proceedings within the jurisdiction of state or federal regulatory agencies nor to judicial review of proceedings before state or federal regulatory agencies. Article VII.e. of this compact shall not be construed to diminish other laws of the United States conferring jurisdiction on the courts of the United States.\n\nf. For the purposes of activities pursuant to this compact, the sovereign immunity of party states and employees of party states shall be as follows:\n\n1. A party state or employee thereof, while acting within the scope of employment, shall not be subject to suit or held liable for damages to persons, property or the environment resulting from the development, construction, operation, regulation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility, or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact. This applies whether the claimed liability of the party state or employee is based on common law, statute, rule or regulation.\n\n2. The sovereign immunity granted in Article VII.f.1. of this compact does not apply to any of the following:\n\n(a) Actions based upon the activities of the party states as generators of waste. With regard to those actions, the sovereign immunity of the party states shall not be affected by this compact.\n\n(b) Actions based on the obligations of the party states to each other and the commission imposed by this compact, or other contracts related to the disposal of waste under this compact. With regard to those actions, the party states shall have no sovereign immunity.\n\n(c) Actions against a host state, or employee thereof, when the host state or employee acted in a grossly negligent or willful and wanton manner.\n\ng. If in any action described in Article VII.f.1. and not described in Article VII.f.2. of this compact, it is determined that, notwithstanding Article VII.f.1. of this compact, a party state, or employee of that state who acted within the scope of employment, is liable for damages or has liability for other matters arising under this compact as described in Article VI.s.3. of this compact, the generators who caused waste to be placed at the compact facility with respect to which the liability was incurred shall indemnify the party state or employee against that liability. Those generators also shall indemnify the party state or employee against all reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in defending against any such action. The indemnification obligation of generators under Article VII.g. of this compact shall be joint and several, except that the indemnification obligation of party states with respect to their activities as generators of waste shall not be joint and several, but instead shall be prorated according to the amount of waste each state has disposed of at the compact facility giving rise to the liability. Among generators, there shall be rights of contribution based upon equitable principles, and generators shall have rights of contribution against any other person responsible for such damages under common law, statute, rule or regulation. A party state that through its own activities did not generate any waste disposed of at the compact facility giving rise to the liability, an employee of such a party state, and the commission shall have no contribution obligation under Article VII.g. of this compact. Article VII.g. of this compact shall not be construed as a waiver of the sovereign immunity provided for in Article VII.f.1. of this compact.\n\nh. The sovereign immunity of a party state provided for in Article VII.f.1. of this compact shall not be extended to any private contractor assigned responsibilities as authorized in Article VI.g. of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VIII. ELIGIBLE PARTIES, WITHDRAWAL, REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OF ACCESS, ENTRY INTO FORCE AND TERMINATION\n\na. Any state may petition the commission to be eligible for membership in the compact. The commission may establish appropriate eligibility requirements. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, an eligibility fee or designation as a host state. A petitioning state becomes eligible for membership in the compact upon the approval of the commission, including the affirmative vote of the member from each host state in which a compact facility is operating or being developed or constructed. Any state becoming eligible upon the approval of the commission becomes a member of the compact when the state enacts this compact into law and pays the eligibility fee established by the commission.\n\nb. The commission is formed upon the appointment of commission members and the tender of the membership fee payable to the commission by three party states. The governor of the first state to enact this compact shall convene the initial meeting of the commission. The commission shall cause legislation to be introduced in the Congress which grants the consent of the Congress to this compact, and shall take action necessary to organize the commission and implement the provision of this compact.\n\nc. A party state that has fully discharged its obligations under Article VI.i. of this compact, or has been relieved under Article VI.e. of this compact of its responsibilities to serve as a host state, may withdraw from this compact by repealing the authorizing legislation and by receiving the unanimous consent of the commission. Withdrawal takes effect on the date specified in the commission resolution consenting to withdrawal. All legal rights of the withdrawn state established under this compact, including, but not limited to, the right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities, cease upon the effective date of withdrawal, but any legal obligations of that party state under this compact, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Article VIII.e. of this compact continue until they are fulfilled.\n\nd. Any party state that fails to comply with the terms of this compact or fails to fulfill its obligations may have reasonable financial penalties imposed against it, the right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities, or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact suspended or its membership in the compact revoked by a two-thirds vote of the commission, provided that the membership of the party state designated to host the next compact facility shall not be revoked unless the member from the host state of any then operating compact facility votes in the affirmative. Revocation takes effect on the date specified in the resolution revoking the party state's membership. All legal rights of the revoked party state established under this compact, including, but not limited to, the right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities, cease upon the effective date of revocation, but any legal obligations of that party state under this compact, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Article VIII.e. of this compact, continue until they are fulfilled. The chairperson of the commission shall transmit written notice of a revocation of a party state's membership in the compact, suspension of a party state's waste disposal rights or imposition of financial penalties immediately following the vote of the commission to the governor of the affected party state, governors of all the other party states and the Congress of the United States.\n\ne. A party state that withdraws from this compact or has its membership in the compact revoked before it has fully discharged its obligations under Article VI of this compact forthwith shall repay to the commission the portion of the funds provided to that state by the commission for the development, construction, operation, closing or long-term care of a compact facility that the commission determines is fair and equitable, taking into consideration the period of time the compact facility located in that host state was in operation and the amount of waste disposed of at the facility. If at any time after a compact facility begins operating, a party state withdraws from the compact or has its membership revoked, the withdrawing or revoked party state shall be obligated forthwith to pay to the commission the amount the commission determines would have been paid under the fee system established by the host state of the facility to dispose of at the facility the estimated volume of waste generated in the withdrawing or revoked party state that would have been disposed of at the facility from the time of withdrawal or revocation until the time the facility is closed. Any funds so paid to the commission shall be distributed by the commission to the persons who would have been entitled to receive the funds had they originally been paid to dispose of waste at the facility. Any person receiving such funds from the commission shall apply the funds to the purposes to which they would have been applied had they originally been paid to dispose of waste at the compact facility. In addition, a withdrawing or revoked party state forthwith shall pay to the commission an amount the commission determines to be necessary to cover all other costs and damages incurred by the commission and the remaining party states as result of the withdrawal or revocation. The intention of Article VIII.e. of this compact is to eliminate any decrease in revenue resulting from withdrawal of a party state or revocation of a party state's membership, to eliminate financial harm to the remaining party states, and to create an incentive for party states to continue as members of the compact and to fulfill their obligations. Article VIII.e. of this compact shall be construed and applied so as to effectuate this intention.\n\nf. Any party state whose right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities is suspended by the commission shall pay to the host state of the compact facility to which access has been suspended the amount the commission determines is reasonably necessary to ensure that the host state, or any political subdivision thereof, does not incur financial loss as a result of the suspension of access.\n\ng. This compact becomes effective upon enactment by at least three eligible states and consent to this compact by the Congress. The consent given to this compact by the Congress shall extend to any future admittance of new party states and to the power of the commission to regulate the shipment and disposal of waste and disposal of naturally occurring and accelerator-produced radioactive material pursuant to this compact. Amendments to this compact are effective when enacted by all party states and, if necessary, consented to by the Congress. To the extent required by section (4)(d) of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, every five years after this compact has taken effect, the Congress by law may withdraw its consent.\n\nh. The withdrawal of a party state from this compact, the suspension of waste disposal rights, the termination of a party state's designation as a host state or the revocation of a state's membership in this compact does not affect the applicability of this compact to the remaining party states.\n\ni. This compact may be dissolved and the obligations arising under this compact may be terminated only as follows:\n\n1. Through unanimous agreement of all party states expressed in duly enacted legislation; or\n\n2. Through withdrawal of consent to this compact by the Congress under Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, in which case dissolution shall take place one hundred twenty days after the effective date of the withdrawal of consent.­­Unless explicitly abrogated by the state legislation dissolving this compact, or if dissolution results from withdrawal of Congressional consent, the limitations on the investment and use of long-term care funds in Articles VI.o. and VI.q.4. of this compact, the contractual obligations in Article V.f. of this compact, the indemnification obligations and contribution rights in Articles VI.o., VI.s. and VII.g. of this compact, and the operation rights and indemnification and hold harmless obligations in Article VI.q. of this compact shall remain in force notwithstanding dissolution of this compact.\n\n­­Unless explicitly abrogated by the state legislation dissolving this compact, or if dissolution results from withdrawal of Congressional consent, the limitations on the investment and use of long-term care funds in Articles VI.o. and VI.q.4. of this compact, the contractual obligations in Article V.f. of this compact, the indemnification obligations and contribution rights in Articles VI.o., VI.s. and VII.g. of this compact, and the operation rights and indemnification and hold harmless obligations in Article VI.q. of this compact shall remain in force notwithstanding dissolution of this compact.\n\nARTICLE IX. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT\n\na. Each party state shall prescribe and enforce penalties against any person who is not an official of another state for violation of any provision of this compact.\n\nb. The parties to this compact intend that the courts of the United States shall specifically enforce the obligations, including the obligations of party states and revoked or withdrawn party states, established by this compact.\n\nc. The commission, an affected party state or both may obtain injunctive relief, recover damages or both to prevent or remedy violations of this compact.\n\nd. Each party state acknowledges that the transport into a host state of waste packaged or transported in violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in the imposition of sanctions by the host state which may include reasonable financial penalties assessed against any generator, transporter or collector responsible for the violation, or suspension or revocation of access to the compact facility in the host state by any generator, transporter or collector responsible for the violation.\n\ne. Each party state has the right to seek legal recourse against any party state which acts in violation of this compact.\n\nf. This compact shall not be construed to create any cause of action for any person other than a party state or the commission. Nothing in Article IX.f. of this compact shall limit the right of judicial review set forth in Article III.n.3. of this compact or the rights of contribution set forth in Articles III.p., VI.o., VI.s. and VII.g. of this compact.\n\nARTICLE X. SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any provision of this compact is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact to that person or circumstance and the applicability of the entire compact to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. If any provision of this compact imposing a financial obligation upon a party state, or a state that has withdrawn from this compact or had its membership in this compact revoked, is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable due to the state's constitutional limitations on its ability to pay the obligation, then that state shall use its best efforts to obtain an appropriation to pay the obligation, and, if the state is a party state, its right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at compact facilities, or any noncompact facility made available to the region by any agreement entered into by the commission pursuant to Article III.h.6. of this compact, shall be suspended until the appropriation is obtained.\n\n(L. 1983 1st Ex.

If consent is not granted by the operator regarding any request made by any officer, employee or agent of the department, or any person under order or contract with the department, under the provisions of this section, the director may issue an order directing compliance with the request. The order may be issued after such notice and opportunity for consultation as is reasonably appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 260.900 to 260.960, in the discretion of the director, an operator may be responsible for up to one hundred percent of the costs of corrective action attributable to such operator if the director finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 536 that:\n\n(1) Requiring the operator to bear such responsibility will not prejudice another owner, operator or person who is eligible, pursuant to the provisions of sections 260.900 to 260.960, to have corrective action costs paid by the fund; and\n\n(2) The operator:\n\n(a) Caused a release in excess of a reportable quantity by willful or wanton actions and such release was caused by operating practices in violation of existing laws and regulations at the time of the release; or\n\n(b) Is in arrears for moneys owed pursuant to sections 260.900 to 260.960, after notice and an opportunity to correct the arrearage; or\n\n(c) Materially obstructs the efforts of the department to carry out its obligations pursuant to sections 260.900 to 260.960; except that, the exercise of legal rights shall not constitute a substantial obstruction; or\n\n(d) Caused or allowed a release in excess of a reportable quantity because of a willful material violation of sections 260.900 to 260.960 or the rules and regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to sections 260.900 to 260.960.\n\n8.

To the extent that an owner or operator is responsible for corrective action costs pursuant to subsection 7 of this section, such owner or operator shall not be entitled to the exemption provided in subsection 5 of section 260.930.\n\n9.

In any such conveyance, the board of directors may impose such conditions and covenants, including conservation easements, as it determines are reasonable and appropriate;\n\n(8) To employ and pay compensation to such employees and agents, including accountants, attorneys, and others as the board of directors shall deem necessary to further the purposes of such nonprofit corporation; and\n\n(9) To enter into contracts with private or public entities to conduct, implement, manage, oversee, and regulate any and all activities that may be necessary or required in connection with the management of the real property and the implementation of any cleanup or remedial action as described in subsection 2 of this section. Any such contract may include provisions for the delivery of administrative support services to the corporation and for a reasonable fee to be paid for management services related to the execution and implementation of any and all activities required by such contract.\n\n4. Any such nonprofit corporation organized under this section shall be managed and regulated by a board consisting of no less than five directors, who shall initially be appointed by the incorporators.

Any such nonprofit corporation may include in any conveyance of any real property to any third party an environmental covenant in the form as set forth in sections 260.1000 to 260.1039 or a conservation easement under section 442.014.\n\n7. Prior to acquiring any interest in any real property that is the subject of any environmental restoration activities, any such nonprofit corporation shall undertake all reasonable and appropriate due diligence activities in accordance with all applicable regulations adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in order to qualify the nonprofit corporation as a bona fide prospective purchaser as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 9601(40), as amended. Provided such nonprofit corporation qualifies as a bona fide prospective purchaser, such nonprofit corporation shall be immune from any liability of any kind or nature under the Missouri hazardous waste management law under sections 260.350 to 260.433; the Missouri solid waste management law under sections 260.200 to 260.345; or the Missouri clean water law under chapter 644 for any conditions that may exist at, on, or under any such real property; however, such corporation shall comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n8.
