Interstate earthquake emergency compact. —The general assembly of the state of Missouri hereby ratifies a compact on behalf of the state of Missouri with any other state legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nThe purpose of this compact is to provide mutual aid among the states in meeting any emergency or disaster caused by earthquakes or other seismic disturbances. The full, immediate, and effective utilization of the resources of the respective states, including such resources as may be available from the United States government or any other source, is necessary to provide needed short-term earthquake disaster assistance to states requesting such mutual aid. These resources shall be incorporated into a plan or plans of mutual aid to be developed among the appropriate agencies of states that are parties to this compact. These agencies shall develop and follow procedures designed to assure the maintenance of resource inventories and the exchange of information about earthquakes and disaster response. It is the policy of the party states to carry out this compact in a spirit of cooperation to provide the most effective earthquake disaster assistance to the residents of the states and to provide an equitable division of any necessary earthquake relief efforts in order to avoid a disproportionate allocation of contributed resources.\n\nEach party state shall have the duty to formulate earthquake relief plans and programs within such state. There shall be frequent consultation between the representatives of such states and with the United States government and the free exchange of relief plans and information, including inventories of any materials and equipment available for response to earthquake emergencies. To this end, each state will maintain a bank of standardized data which will establish a comprehensive listing of all resources within the seven-state region that might be needed during an earthquake disaster. The inventory will be shared equitably among the party states in the event of an earthquake recognizing each state's primary responsibility to assist and protect its residents. Each party state shall also share any available information on earthquake forecasts and reports of seismic activity.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nWhenever the governor of a party state requests aid from the governor of another party state pursuant to this compact in coping with an earthquake emergency, the requested state shall make available all possible aid to the requesting state consistent with the maintenance of protection for its residents and the policies stated in article I.\n\nWhenever the officers or employees of any party state are rendering aid in another state pursuant to the request of another party state under this compact, those officers or employees shall, while under the direction of the authorities of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as comparable officers and employees of the state to which they are rendering aid. Any person holding a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state demonstrating the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills may render aid involving such skill in any party state to meet an earthquake emergency, and the state in which aid is rendered shall give due recognition to such license, certificate, or other permit as if issued in the state in which aid is rendered.\n\nNo party or its officers, employees or other persons, certified by party states pursuant to agreed upon criteria and procedures for certification, rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on their part while so engaged, or on account of maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.\n\nNothing in this agreement precludes any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or states for the undertaking of mutual aid and exchange of information in the event of an earthquake emergency. These supplementary agreements may comprehend but are not limited to provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, equipment and supplies.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nEach party state shall provide compensation and death benefits to its injured officers, employees or other persons certified by party states, pursuant to agreed upon criteria and procedures for certification, and the representatives of deceased officers, employees and other certified persons in case officers, employees or certified persons sustain injuries or death while rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within the state by or in which the officer, employee or certified person was regularly employed.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nAny party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries and maintenance of officers, employees and equipment incurred in connection with such request, including amounts paid under article VII; provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting party state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost. Any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs as among those states. The United States government may in some circumstances relieve the party state receiving aid from any liability and reimburse the party state rendering aid for some loss, damage or expense incurred within the terms of this article.\n\nPlans for the orderly evacuation and reception of the civilian population as the result of an earthquake emergency shall be worked out from time to time between representatives of the party states.

Any political subdivision which contains a sponsor which has submitted a plan which has been approved by the director pursuant to sections 256.435 to 256.445 may submit to the qualified voters of the political subdivision the following question:\n\n2. If it appears that the required percentage of the voters of such political subdivision voting on the proposition of incurring indebtedness submitted at the election were in favor of incurring such indebtedness, the election authority shall make an order reciting the holding of such election and the results thereof, both for and against the proposition, and if the result of the election as certified shall be in favor of incurring the indebtedness and issuing the bonds, then the governing body of the political subdivision shall direct the issuance thereof to the amount of the debt authorized to be incurred, or any portion thereof, and shall either before or at the time of doing so provide for the collection of an annual ad valorem tax upon all of the taxable property within the political subdivision, which tax shall be sufficient to pay the interest on such indebtedness as it falls due and also to create a sinking fund for the payment of the principal thereof within twenty years from the date of contracting the same, such tax to be levied and collected as provided for in chapter 137.\n\n3.

The governing body of the political subdivision wherein such project is situate shall certify the amount of money that will be required during the next succeeding year to pay interest falling due on bonds issued and the principal of bonds maturing in such year, and the amount necessary to cover the estimated expenses of maintaining such project in good condition. The governing body shall, at the time it makes the levy for other taxes, by order made, levy such a rate of taxes upon all the taxable property in the political subdivision as will produce a sum of money sufficient for the purposes of the water resource project; provided, that the governing body shall have no authority to levy such tax until the voters of the political subdivision shall have voted to incur an indebtedness under the provisions of this section.\n\n8.
