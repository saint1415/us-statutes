      "text": "Title XIII CORRECTIONAL AND PENAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nChapter 217\n\n217.490. Agreement on detainers adopted — compact text. —The \"Agreement on Detainers\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nAGREEMENT ON DETAINERS\n\nThe party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.\n\nAs used in this agreement:\n\n1.\"State\"means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n2.\"Sending state\"means a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to article III of this agreement or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to article IV hereof.\n\n3.\"Receiving state\"means the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to article III or article IV of this agreement.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n1. Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.\n\n2. The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, director of the division of adult institutions or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n3. The warden, director of the division of adult institutions or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.\n\n4. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, director of the division of adult institutions or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\n5. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph 4 of this article, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.\n\n6. Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall void the request.\n\n1. The appropriate officers of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with paragraph 1 of article V of this agreement upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of the indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.\n\n2. Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph 1 of this article, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. The authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.\n\n3. In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\n\n4. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph 1 of this article, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.\n\n5. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to paragraph 5 of article V of this agreement, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\n1. In response to a request made under article III or article IV of this agreement, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of the prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where the indictment, information or complaint is pending against the person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.\n\n2. The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:\n\n(1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given; and\n\n(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.\n\n3. If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of the person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III or article IV of this agreement, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.\n\n4. The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations, or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.\n\n5. At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.\n\n6. During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.\n\n7. For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.\n\n8. From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n\n1. In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of the time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.\n\n2. No provisions of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nEach state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nThis agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.\n\nThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1196 § 86)\n\n(1987) The 180-day limitation period imposed by subsection 1 of article III of this section does not commence until proper state authorities receive a request for final disposition of an outstanding detainer.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.\n\nDefinitions\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\n(a)\"State\"means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(b)\"Sending state\"means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n\n(c)\"Receiving state\"means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n\n(d)\"Inmate\"means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution.\n\n(e)\"Institution\"means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n1. Its duration.\n\n2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.\n\n3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any; the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom.\n\n4.

The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n\n(f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made.

All releases or paroles shall issue upon order of the parole board, duly adopted.\n\n2. Before ordering the parole of any offender, the parole board shall conduct a validated risk and needs assessment and evaluate the case under the rules governing parole that are promulgated by the parole board. The parole board shall then have the offender appear before a hearing panel and shall conduct a personal interview with him or her, unless waived by the offender, or if the guidelines indicate the offender may be paroled without need for an interview. The guidelines and rules shall not allow for the waiver of a hearing if a victim requests a hearing. The appearance or presence may occur by means of a videoconference at the discretion of the parole board. A parole may be ordered for the best interest of society when there is a reasonable probability, based on the risk assessment and indicators of release readiness, that the person can be supervised under parole supervision and successfully reintegrated into the community, not as an award of clemency; it shall not be considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon. Every offender while on parole shall remain in the legal custody of the department but shall be subject to the orders of the parole board.\n\n3. The division of probation and parole has discretionary authority to require the payment of a fee, not to exceed sixty dollars per month, from every offender placed under division supervision on probation, parole, or conditional release, to waive all or part of any fee, to sanction offenders for willful nonpayment of fees, and to contract with a private entity for fee collections services. All fees collected shall be deposited in the inmate fund established in section 217.430. Fees collected may be used to pay the costs of contracted collections services. The fees collected may otherwise be used to provide community corrections and intervention services for offenders. Such services include substance abuse assessment and treatment, mental health assessment and treatment, electronic monitoring services, residential facilities services, employment placement services, and other offender community corrections or intervention services designated by the division of probation and parole to assist offenders to successfully complete probation, parole, or conditional release. The division of probation and parole shall adopt rules not inconsistent with law, in accordance with section 217.040, with respect to sanctioning offenders and with respect to establishing, waiving, collecting, and using fees.\n\n4. The parole board shall adopt rules not inconsistent with law, in accordance with section 217.040, with respect to the eligibility of offenders for parole, the conduct of parole hearings or conditions to be imposed upon paroled offenders. Whenever an order for parole is issued it shall recite the conditions of such parole.\n\n5. When considering parole for an offender with consecutive sentences, the minimum term for eligibility for parole shall be calculated by adding the minimum terms for parole eligibility for each of the consecutive sentences, except the minimum term for parole eligibility shall not exceed the minimum term for parole eligibility for an ordinary life sentence.\n\n6. Any offender sentenced to a term of imprisonment amounting to fifteen years or more or multiple terms of imprisonment that, taken together, amount to fifteen or more years who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense or offenses may be eligible for parole after serving fifteen years of incarceration, regardless of whether the case is final for the purposes of appeal, and may be eligible for reconsideration hearings in accordance with regulations promulgated by the parole board.\n\n7. The provisions of subsection 6 of this section shall not apply to an offender found guilty of capital murder, murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree, when murder in the second degree is committed pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 565.021, who was under eighteen years of age when the offender committed the offense or offenses who may be found ineligible for parole or whose parole eligibility may be controlled by section 558.047 or 565.033.\n\n8. Any offender under a sentence for first degree murder who has been denied release on parole after a parole hearing shall not be eligible for another parole hearing until at least three years from the month of the parole denial; however, this subsection shall not prevent a release pursuant to subsection 4 of section 558.011.\n\n9. A victim who has requested an opportunity to be heard shall receive notice that the parole board is conducting an assessment of the offender's risk and readiness for release and that the victim's input will be particularly helpful when it pertains to safety concerns and specific protective measures that may be beneficial to the victim should the offender be granted release.\n\n10. Parole hearings shall, at a minimum, contain the following procedures:\n\n(1) The victim or person representing the victim who attends a hearing may be accompanied by one other person;\n\n(2) The victim or person representing the victim who attends a hearing shall have the option of giving testimony in the presence of the inmate or to the hearing panel without the inmate being present;\n\n(3) The victim or person representing the victim may call or write the parole board rather than attend the hearing;\n\n(4) The victim or person representing the victim may have a personal meeting with a parole board member at the parole board's central office;\n\n(5) The judge, prosecuting attorney or circuit attorney and a representative of the local law enforcement agency investigating the crime shall be allowed to attend the hearing or provide information to the hearing panel in regard to the parole consideration; and\n\n(6) The parole board shall evaluate information listed in the juvenile sex offender registry pursuant to section 211.425, provided the offender is between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one, as it impacts the safety of the community.\n\n11. The parole board shall notify any person of the results of a parole eligibility hearing if the person indicates to the parole board a desire to be notified.\n\n12. The parole board may, at its discretion, require any offender seeking parole to meet certain conditions during the term of that parole so long as said conditions are not illegal or impossible for the offender to perform. These conditions may include an amount of restitution to the state for the cost of that offender's incarceration.\n\n13. Special parole conditions shall be responsive to the assessed risk and needs of the offender or the need for extraordinary supervision, such as electronic monitoring. The parole board shall adopt rules to minimize the conditions placed on low-risk cases, to frontload conditions upon release, and to require the modification and reduction of conditions based on the person's continuing stability in the community. Parole board rules shall permit parole conditions to be modified by parole officers with review and approval by supervisors.\n\n14. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the release of an offender on parole nor to reduce the sentence of an offender heretofore committed.\n\n15. Beginning January 1, 2001, the parole board shall not order a parole unless the offender has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent, or unless the parole board is satisfied that the offender, while committed to the custody of the department, has made an honest good-faith effort to obtain a high school diploma or its equivalent; provided that the director may waive this requirement by certifying in writing to the parole board that the offender has actively participated in mandatory education programs or is academically unable to obtain a high school diploma or its equivalent.\n\n16. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2005, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1982 H.B. 1196 § 123, A.L. 1986 S.B. 450, A.L. 1987 S.B. 261, A.L. 1989 H.B. 128, et al., H.B. 408, A.L. 1992 S.B. 638, A.L. 1995 H.B. 424, A.L. 2002 S.B. 969, et al., A.L. 2005 H.B. 700, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1355, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60, A.L. 2024 S.B. 754, et al.)",

The motion may be made any time prior to the first month in which the person may earn compliance credits under this section or at a hearing under subsection 5 of this section.
