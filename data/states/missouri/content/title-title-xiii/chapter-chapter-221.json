Unless the privilege is expressly granted by the sentencing court, the prisoner is sentenced to ordinary confinement. The prisoner may petition the sentencing court for the privilege at the time of sentence or thereafter, and in the discretion of the sentencing court may renew his petition. The sentencing court may withdraw the privilege at any time by order entered with or without notice.\n\n3. The sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, shall endeavor to secure employment for unemployed prisoners sentenced under this section. If a prisoner is employed for wages or salary the sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, shall collect the same or require the prisoner to turn over his wages or salary in full when received, and the sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, shall deposit the same in a trust checking account and shall keep a ledger showing the status of the account of each prisoner. The wages or salary are not subject to garnishment in the hands of either the employer or the sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, during the prisoner's term, and shall be disbursed as provided in this section; but for tax purposes they are income of the prisoner.\n\n4. Every prisoner gainfully employed under this section is liable for the cost of his board. If necessarily absent from jail at a meal time he shall upon request be furnished with an adequate nourishing lunch to carry to work. The sheriff shall charge his account, if he has one, for the board. If the prisoner is gainfully self-employed he shall pay the sheriff for the board, in default of which his privilege under this section is automatically forfeited.\n\n5. By order of the sentencing court, the wages of employed prisoners shall be disbursed by the sheriff for the following purposes:\n\n(1) The board of the prisoner;\n\n(2) Necessary travel expenses to and from work and other incidental expenses of the prisoner;\n\n(3) Support of the prisoner's dependents, if any;\n\n(4) Payment, either in full or ratably, of the prisoner's obligations acknowledged by him in writing or which have been reduced to judgment;\n\n(5) The balance, if any, to the prisoner upon his discharge.\n\n6. The court may by order authorize the sheriff to whom the prisoner is committed to arrange with another sheriff for the employment of the prisoner in the other's county, and while so employed to be and continue subject to the commitment.\n\n7. The county commission or governing body may, if the sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, requests it, by resolution direct that all functions of the sheriff of the county or the warden of the city, whichever the case may be, under subsection 3 or 5 or both be performed by the county or city welfare office; or, if the county commission or governing body has not so directed, the sentencing court may order that the prisoner's earnings be collected and disbursed by the clerk of the sentencing court.

In the case of a violation of the law or jail regulations, the prisoner shall be returned to the sentencing court; and it may require that the balance of his sentence be spent in actual confinement and may cancel any earned diminution of his term.\n\n12.

The tax authorized by this section shall be in addition to any and all other sales taxes allowed by law, except that no order imposing a sales tax pursuant to this section shall be effective unless the commission submits to the voters of the district, on any election date authorized in chapter 115, a proposal to authorize the commission to impose a tax.\n\n2. The ballot of submission shall contain, but need not be limited to, the following language:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters of the district voting thereon are in favor of the proposal, then the order and any amendment to such order shall be in effect on the first day of the second quarter immediately following the election approving the proposal. If the proposal receives less than the required majority, the commission shall have no power to impose the sales tax authorized pursuant to this section unless and until the commission shall again have submitted another proposal to authorize the commission to impose the sales tax authorized by this section and such proposal is approved by the majority of the qualified voters of the district voting on such proposal.\n\n3. In the case of a county attempting to join an existing district that levies a sales tax pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, such joining with the district shall not become effective until the approval of the voters to levy the district sales tax in the county attempting to join the district has been obtained. The election shall be called by the county commission of the county attempting to join the district, and the district shall by ordinance or order provide that the sales tax shall be levied in the joining county, subject to approval of the county voters as herein provided.

All revenue received by a district from the tax authorized pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a special trust fund and shall be used solely for providing jail services, facilities, and equipment for such district for so long as the tax shall remain in effect.\n\n5. Once the tax authorized by this section is abolished or terminated by any means, all funds remaining in the special trust fund shall be used solely for providing jail services, facilities, and equipment for the district.

The moneys in the regional jail district sales tax trust fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the trust fund which was collected in each district imposing a sales tax pursuant to this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of each member county and the public. Not later than the tenth day of each month the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the trust fund during the preceding month to the district which levied the tax. Such funds shall be deposited with the treasurer of each such district, and all expenditures of funds arising from the regional jail district sales tax trust fund shall be paid pursuant to an appropriation adopted by the commission and shall be approved by the commission.

After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such district, the director of revenue shall remit the balance in the account to the district and close the account of that district. The director of revenue shall notify each district in each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the district.\n\n8.
