The secretary of state shall not publish any proposed rulemaking or final order of rulemaking that has not fully complied with the provisions of section 536.024 or an executive order, whichever appropriately applies. If the joint committee on administrative rules disapproves any proposed order of rulemaking, final order of rulemaking or portion thereof, the committee shall report its finding to the house of representatives and the senate. No proposed order of rulemaking, final order of rulemaking or portion thereof shall take effect, or be published by the secretary of state, so long as the general assembly shall disapprove such by concurrent resolution pursuant to Article IV, Section 8 within thirty legislative days occurring during the same regular session of the general assembly.

Any state agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking may order a hearing thereon, but no such hearing shall be necessary unless otherwise required by law.\n\n4. Any state agency which has issued in the Missouri Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to be made without a hearing, but which thereafter concludes that a hearing is desirable, shall withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking which fully complies with the provisions of subdivision (6) of subsection 2 of this section, and the state agency shall not schedule the hearing for a time less than thirty days following the publication of the new notice.\n\n5.

Except as provided in section 536.025, any rule, or amendment or rescission thereof, shall be null, void and unenforceable unless made in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n8. Except as provided in subsection 1 of this section and subsection 4 of section 536.031, after the final order of rulemaking has been published in the Missouri Register, the text of the entire rule shall be published in full in the Missouri code of state regulations. No rule, except an emergency rule, shall become effective prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the revision to the Missouri code of state regulations. The secretary of state shall distribute revisions of the Missouri code of state regulations to all subscribers of the Missouri code of state regulations on or before the date of publication of such revision. The publication date of each rule shall be printed below the rule in the Missouri code of state regulations, provided further, that rules pertaining to changes in hunting or fishing seasons and limits that must comply with federal requirements or that are necessary because of documented changes in fish and game populations may become effective no earlier than on the tenth day after the filing of the final order of rulemaking.\n\n9. If it is found in a contested case by an administrative or judicial fact finder that a state agency's action was based upon a statement of general applicability which should have been adopted as a rule, as required by sections 536.010 to 536.050, and that agency was put on notice in writing of such deficiency prior to the administrative or judicial hearing on such matter, then the administrative or judicial fact finder shall award the prevailing nonstate agency party its reasonable attorney's fees incurred prior to the award, not to exceed the amount in controversy in the original action. This award shall constitute a reviewable order. If a state agency in a contested case grants the relief sought by the nonstate party prior to a finding by an administrative or judicial fact finder that the agency's action was based on a statement of general applicability which should have been adopted as a rule, but was not, then the affected party may bring an action in the circuit court of Cole County for the nonstate party's reasonable attorney's fees incurred prior to the relief being granted, not to exceed the amount in controversy in the original action.\n\n10. The actions authorized by subsection 9 of this section shall not apply to the department of revenue if that department implements the authorization hereby granted to the director or the director's duly authorized agents to issue letter rulings which shall bind the director or the director's agents and their successors for a minimum of three years, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in properly published regulations. An unfavorable letter ruling shall not bind the applicant and shall not be appealable to any forum.

At the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule, the agency shall file with the secretary of state and the joint committee on administrative rules the text of the rule and the fiscal note required by sections 536.200 and 536.205 together with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support the agency's conclusion that the agency has fully complied with the requirements of subsection 1 of this section. If an agency finds that a rule is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest that requires an early effective date, the agency shall certify in writing the reasons therefor.\n\n3. After a filing by an agency of materials under subsection 2 of this section, the secretary of state shall:\n\n(1) As soon as practicable, publish such materials in the Missouri Register;\n\n(2) Within three business days, email such materials to persons who have registered to be notified of the agency's actions through the secretary of state's administrative rules notification system; and\n\n(3) Within three business days, publish such materials on the official website of the secretary of state.\n\n­­Any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the secretary of state to determine compliance with the requirements for its publication and adoption established in this section, and in the event that the secretary of state determines that such proposed material does not meet those requirements, the secretary of state shall not publish the rule. The secretary of state shall inform the agency of its determination, and offer the agency a chance to either withdraw the rule or to have it published as a proposed rule.\n\n4. The committee may file with the secretary of state any comments or recommendations that the committee has concerning a proposed or final order of rulemaking. Such comments shall be published in the Missouri Register.\n\n5. The committee may refer comments or recommendations concerning such rule to the appropriations and budget committee of the house of representatives and the appropriations committee of the senate for further action.\n\n6. Rules adopted under the provisions of this section shall be known as \"emergency rules\" and shall, along with the findings and conclusions of the state agency in support of its employment of emergency procedures, be judicially reviewable under section 536.050 or other appropriate form of judicial review. The secretary of state and any employee thereof, acting in the scope of employment, shall be immune from suit in actions regarding the adoption of rules pursuant to this section.\n\n7. A rule adopted under the provisions of this section shall clearly state the interval during which it will be in effect. Emergency rules shall not be in effect for a period exceeding one hundred eighty calendar days or thirty legislative days, whichever period is longer. For the purposes of this section, a\"legislative day\"is each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday beginning the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January and ending the first Friday after the second Monday in May, regardless of whether the legislature meets.\n\n8. A rule adopted under the provisions of this section shall not be renewable, nor shall an agency adopt consecutive emergency rules that have substantially the same effect, although a state agency may, at any time, adopt an identical rule under normal rulemaking procedures.\n\n9. A rule adopted under the provisions of this section may be effective not less than ten business days after the filing thereof in the office of the secretary of state, or at such later date as may be specified in the rule, and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable after the filing thereof.\n\n10. If it is found in a contested case by an administrative or judicial fact finder that an agency rule should not have been adopted as an emergency rule as provided by subsection 1 of this section, then the administrative or judicial fact finder shall award the nonstate party who prevails, as defined in this section, its reasonable fees and expenses, as defined in this section. This award shall constitute a reviewable order. If a state agency in a contested case grants the relief sought by the party prior to a finding by an administrative or judicial fact finder that the state agency's action was based on a statement of general applicability which should not have been adopted as an emergency rule, but was in fact adopted as an emergency rule pursuant to this section, then the affected party may bring an action in circuit court of Cole County for the nonstate party's reasonable fees and expenses, as defined in this section.\n\n11. For the purposes of this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Prevails\", obtains a favorable order, decision, judgment or dismissal in a civil action or agency proceeding;\n\n(2)\"Reasonable fees and expenses\"includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test or project which is found by the court or agency to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable attorney or agent fees.\n\n(L. 1975 S.B. 58, A.L. 1976 S.B. 478, A.L. 1993 S.B. 52, A.L. 1995 S.B. 3, A.L. 1997 H.B. 850, A.L. 2019 H.B. 1088)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nWorkers' compensation cases, this section not deemed to govern discovery between parties, 287.811",

Contingent delegation of rulemaking power — effective date of rules — notice to be filed with joint committee — committee's powers — disapproval or annulment of rules, grounds, procedure, effect — publishing of rules, when — nonseverable — contingent effective date. —1. Notwithstanding provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the delegation of authority to any state agency to propose to the general assembly rules as provided under this section is contingent upon the agency complying with the provisions of this chapter and this delegation of legislative power to the agency to propose a final order of rulemaking containing a rule or portion thereof that has the effect of substantive law, other than a rule relating to the agency's organization and internal management, is contingent and dependent upon the power of the general assembly to review such proposed order of rulemaking, to delay the effective date of such proposed order of rulemaking until the expiration of at least thirty legislative days of a regular session after such order is filed with the general assembly and the secretary of state, and to disapprove and annul any rule or portion thereof contained in such order of rulemaking.\n\n2. No rule or portion of a rule that has the effect of substantive law shall become effective until the final order of rulemaking has been reviewed by the general assembly in accordance with the procedures provided pursuant to this chapter. Any agency's authority to propose an order of rulemaking is dependent upon the power of the general assembly to disapprove and annul any such proposed rule or portion thereof.\n\n3. In order for the general assembly to have an effective opportunity to be advised of rules proposed by any state agency, an agency shall propose a rule or order of rulemaking by complying with the procedures provided in this chapter, except that the notice of proposed rulemaking shall first be filed with the general assembly by providing a copy thereof to the joint committee on administrative rules, which may hold hearings upon any proposed rule, order of rulemaking or portion thereof at any time. The agency shall cooperate with the joint committee on administrative rules by providing any witnesses, documents or information within the control of the agency as may be requested.\n\n4. Such proposed order of rulemaking shall not become effective prior to the expiration of thirty legislative days of a regular session after such order is filed with the secretary of state and the joint committee on administrative rules.\n\n5. The committee may, by majority vote of its members, recommend that the general assembly disapprove and annul any rule or portion thereof contained in an order of rulemaking after hearings thereon and upon a finding that such rule or portion thereof should be disapproved and annulled. Grounds upon which the committee may recommend such action include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Such rule is substantive in nature in that it creates rights or liabilities or provides for sanctions as to any person, corporation or other legal entity; and\n\n(2) Such rule or portion thereof is not in the public interest or is not authorized by the general assembly for one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) An absence of statutory authority for the proposed rule;\n\n(b) The proposed rule is in conflict with state law;\n\n(c) Such proposed rule is likely to substantially endanger the public health, safety or welfare;\n\n(d) The rule exceeds the purpose, or is more restrictive than is necessary to carry out the purpose, of the statute granting rulemaking authority;\n\n(e) A substantial change in circumstance has occurred since enactment of the law upon which the proposed rule is based as to result in a conflict between the purpose of the law and the proposed rule, or as to create a substantial danger to public health and welfare; or\n\n(f) The proposed rule is so arbitrary and capricious as to create such substantial inequity as to be unreasonably burdensome on persons affected.\n\n6. Any recommendation or report issued by the committee pursuant to subsection 5 of this section shall be admissible as evidence in any judicial proceeding and entitled to judicial notice without further proof.\n\n7. The general assembly may adopt a concurrent resolution in accordance with the provisions of Article IV, Section 8 of the Missouri Constitution to disapprove and annul any rule or portion thereof.\n\n8. Any rule or portion thereof not disapproved within thirty legislative days of a regular session pursuant to subsection 7 of this section shall be deemed approved by the general assembly and the secretary of state may publish such final order of rulemaking as soon as practicable upon the expiration of thirty legislative days of a regular session after the final order of rulemaking was filed with the secretary of state and the joint committee on administrative rules.\n\n9. Upon adoption of such concurrent resolution as provided in subsection 7 of this section, the secretary of state shall not publish the order of rulemaking until the expiration of time necessary for such resolution to be signed by the governor, or vetoed and subsequently acted upon by the general assembly pursuant to Article III, Section 32 of the Missouri Constitution. If such concurrent resolution is adopted and signed by the governor or otherwise reconsidered pursuant to Article III, Section 32, the secretary of state shall publish in the Missouri Register, as soon as practicable, the order of rulemaking along with notice of the proposed rules or portions thereof which are disapproved and annulled by the general assembly.\n\n10. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1.140, the provisions of this section, section 536.021 and section 536.025 are nonseverable and the delegation of legislative authority to an agency to propose orders of rulemaking is essentially dependent upon the powers vested with the general assembly as provided herein. If any of the powers vested with the general assembly or the joint committee on administrative rules to review, to hold in abeyance the rule pending action by the general assembly, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule or portion of a rule contained in an order of rulemaking, are held unconstitutional or invalid, the purported grant of rulemaking authority and any rule so proposed and contained in the order of rulemaking shall be revoked and shall be null, void and unenforceable.\n\n11. Nothing in this section shall prevent the general assembly from adopting by concurrent resolution or bill within thirty legislative days of a regular session the rules or portions thereof, or as the same may be amended or annulled, as contained in a proposed order of rulemaking. In that event, the proposed order of rulemaking shall have been superseded and the order and any rule proposed therein shall be null, void and unenforceable. The secretary of state shall not publish a proposed order of rulemaking acted upon as described herein.\n\n12. Upon adoption of any rule now or hereafter in effect, such rule or portion thereof may be revoked by the general assembly either by bill or by concurrent resolution pursuant to Article IV, Section 8 of the Constitution on recommendation of the joint committee on administrative rules. The secretary of state shall publish in the Missouri Register, as soon as practicable, notice of the revocation.\n\n13. This section shall become effective only upon the expiration of twenty calendar days following the:\n\n(1) Failure of the executive to sign executive order number 97-97; or\n\n(2) Modification, amendment or rescission of executive order number 97-97; or\n\n(3) An agency's failure to hold the rule in abeyance as required by executive order number 97-97; or\n\n(4) Declaration by a court with jurisdiction that section 536.024 or any portion of executive order number 97-97 is unconstitutional or invalid for any reason. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, no modification, amendment or rescission of executive order number 97-97 or failure to hold a rule in abeyance shall make this section effective if the modification, amendment or rescission of the executive order or failure to hold the rule in abeyance is approved by the general assembly by concurrent resolution.\n\n(L. 1997 H.B. 335, Repealed 1997 H.B. 600 & 388, A.L. 1997 H.B. 850)\n\n*Contingent effective date, see subsection 13 of this section.\n\n*Revisor's Note: To date, the contingencies contained in this section regarding Executive Order 97-97 have not occurred.",

When the state appeals the underlying merits of an adversary proceeding, no decision on the application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary proceeding shall be made pursuant to this section until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.\n\n6. The court may either reduce the amount to be awarded or deny any award, to the extent that the prevailing nonstate party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.\n\n7. The decision of a court on the application for reasonable fees and expenses shall be in writing, separate from the judgment or order of the court which determined the prevailing party, and shall include written findings and conclusions and the reason or basis therefor. The decision of a court on the application for fees and other expenses shall be final, subject respectively to appeal or judicial review.\n\n8. If a party or the state is dissatisfied with a determination of fees and other expenses made in an action brought pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, that party or the state may, within the time permitted by law, appeal that order or judgment to the appellate court having jurisdiction to review the merits of that order or judgment. The appellate court's determination shall be based solely on the record made before the court below. The court may modify, reverse or reverse and remand the determination of fees and other expenses if the court finds that the award or failure to make an award of fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award, was arbitrary and capricious, was unreasonable, was unsupported by competent and substantial evidence, or was made contrary to law or in excess of the court's jurisdiction. Awards made pursuant to this section shall be payable from amounts appropriated therefor. The state agency against which the award was made shall request an appropriation to pay for the award.\n\n9. The general assembly or its designee shall have standing, in law or equity, to intervene in any existing action involving such challenge to agency action. Unless otherwise provided by resolution, the general assembly's designee is the joint committee on administrative rules who may, upon a concurrence of a majority of the committee's members, intervene in the name of the members of the committee in their representative capacity. Nothing in this section shall confer upon the committee any duty to so act or intervene.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1504 § 5, A.L. 1978 S.B. 661, A.L. 1996 S.B. 720, A.L. 1997 H.B. 850, A.L. 2005 H.B. 576)\n\n*Section 536.303 was repealed by S.B. 894 & 825, 2024.\n\n(1982) Statutory provisions which purport to authorize the Administrative Hearing Commission to render declaratory judgments are unconstitutional as violative of Section 1, Article V of the Missouri Constitution. State Tax Commission v. Administrative Hearing Commission (Mo.banc), 641 S.W.2d 69.\n\n(1993) Where action is based on specific facts involving named entities and is a challenge to an agency decision, jurisdiction to challenged decision is vested in the administrative hearing commission under section 208.156, RSMo. Because action challenged an agency decision and not an agency rule, this section does not allow a declaratory judgment action to be brought in the circuit court.

Not later than seven days after such service, or at such later time as may be stipulated, any other party (or, in a proper case, the agency) may serve on the party or the agency who served such affidavit an objection to the use of the affidavit or some designated portion or portions thereof on the ground that it is in the form of an affidavit; provided, however, that if such affidavit shall have been served less than eight days before the hearing such objection may be served at any time before the hearing or may be made orally at the hearing. If such objection is so served, the affidavit or the part thereof to which objection was made, may not be used except in ways that would have been permissible in the absence of this subdivision; provided, however, that such objection may be waived by the party or the agency making the same. Failure to serve an objection as aforesaid, based on the ground aforesaid, shall constitute a waiver of all objections to the introduction of such affidavit, or of the parts thereof with respect to which no such objection was so served, on the ground that it is in the form of an affidavit, or that it constitutes or contains hearsay evidence, or that it is not, or contains matters which are not, the best evidence, but any and all other objections may be made at the hearing. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the cross-examination of the affiant if he or she is present in obedience to a subpoena or otherwise and if he or she is present, he or she may be called for cross-examination during the case of the party who introduced the affidavit in evidence. If the affidavit is admissible in part only it shall be admitted as to such part, without the necessity of preparing a new affidavit. The manner of service of such affidavit and of such objection shall be by delivering or mailing copies thereof to the attorneys of record of the parties being served, if any, otherwise, to such parties, and service shall be deemed complete upon mailing; provided, however, that when the parties are so numerous as to make service of copies of the affidavit on all of them unduly onerous, the agency may make an order specifying on what parties service of copies of such affidavit shall be made, and in that case a copy of such affidavit shall be filed with the agency and kept available for inspection and copying.

In addition to the powers granted in subsection 1 of this section, any agency authorized to hear a contested case may make rules to provide that the parties may obtain all or any designated part of the same discovery that any Missouri supreme court rule provides for civil actions in circuit court. The agency may enforce discovery by the same methods, terms and conditions as provided by supreme court rule in civil actions in the circuit court.

The committee may hold one or more hearings upon such final order of rulemaking during the thirty-day period. If the committee does not disapprove such order of rulemaking within the thirty-day period, the filing agency may file such order of rulemaking with the secretary of state and the order of rulemaking shall be deemed approved. Contrary provisions of the law notwithstanding, if the committee approves a proposed rule prior to the expiration of the period for review, it shall notify the filing agency and the secretary of state at which point the final order of rulemaking may be filed.\n\n7. The committee may, by majority vote of the members, suspend the order of rulemaking or portion thereof by action taken prior to the filing of the final order of rulemaking only for one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(1) An absence of statutory authority for the proposed rule;\n\n(2) An emergency relating to public health, safety or welfare;\n\n(3) The proposed rule is in conflict with state law;\n\n(4) A substantial change in circumstance since enactment of the law upon which the proposed rule is based;\n\n(5) The proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious.\n\n8.

The amount of fees awarded as reasonable fees and expenses shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the state in the type of civil action or agency proceeding, and attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of seventy-five dollars per hour unless the court determines that a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee;\n\n(5)\"State\", the state of Missouri, its officers and its agencies, but shall not include political subdivisions of the state.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 143 § 4)",

Reasonable fees and expenses awarded prevailing party in civil action or agency proceeding — application, content, filed with court or agency where party appeared — appeal by state, effect — power of court or agency to reduce requested amount or deny, when — form of award — judicial review, when. —1. A party who prevails in an agency proceeding or civil action arising therefrom, brought by or against the state, shall be awarded those reasonable fees and expenses incurred by that party in the civil action or agency proceeding, unless the court or agency finds that the position of the state was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\n\n2. In awarding reasonable fees and expenses under this section to a party who prevails in any action for judicial review of an agency proceeding, the court shall include in that award reasonable fees and expenses incurred during such agency proceeding unless the court finds that during such agency proceeding the position of the state was substantially justified, or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\n\n3. A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of a final disposition in an agency proceeding or final judgment in a civil action, submit to the court, agency or commission which rendered the final disposition or judgment an application which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this section, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses are computed. The party shall also allege that the position of the state was not substantially justified. The fact that the state has lost the agency proceeding or civil action creates no legal presumption that its position was not substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the state was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by an agency upon which a civil action is based) which is made in the agency proceeding or civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought, and on the basis of the record of any hearing the court or agency deems appropriate to determine whether an award of reasonable fees and expenses should be made, provided that any such hearing shall be limited to consideration of matters which affected the agency's decision leading to the position at issue in the fee application.\n\n4. A prevailing party in an agency proceeding shall submit an application for fees and expenses to the administrative body before which the party prevailed. A prevailing party in a civil action on appeal from an agency proceeding shall submit an application for fees and expenses to the court. The filing of an application shall not stay the time for appealing the merits of a case. When the state appeals the underlying merits of an adversary proceeding, no decision on the application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary proceeding shall be made under this section until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.\n\n5. The court or agency may either reduce the amount to be awarded or deny any award, to the extent that the prevailing party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.\n\n6. The decision of a court or an agency on the application for reasonable fees and expenses shall be in writing, separate from the judgment or order of the court or the administrative decision which determined the prevailing party, and shall include written findings and conclusions and the reason or basis therefor. The decision of a court or an agency on the application for fees and other expenses shall be final, subject respectively to appeal or judicial review.\n\n7. If a party or the state is dissatisfied with a determination of fees and other expenses made in an agency proceeding, that party or the state may within thirty days after the determination is made, seek judicial review of that determination from the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the agency adversary proceeding. If a party or the state is dissatisfied with a determination of fees and other expenses made in a civil action arising from an agency proceeding, that party or the state may, within the time permitted by law, appeal that order or judgment to the appellate court having jurisdiction to review the merits of that order or judgment. The reviewing or appellate court's determination on any judicial review or appeal heard under this subsection shall be based solely on the record made before the agency or court below. The court may modify, reverse or reverse and remand the determination of fees and other expenses if the court finds that the award or failure to make an award of fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award, was arbitrary and capricious, was unreasonable, was unsupported by competent and substantial evidence, or was made contrary to law or in excess of the court's or agency's jurisdiction.

The inquiry may extend to a determination of whether the action of the agency\n\n(1) Is in violation of constitutional provisions;\n\n(2) Is in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency;\n\n(3) Is unsupported by competent and substantial evidence upon the whole record;\n\n(4) Is, for any other reason, unauthorized by law;\n\n(5) Is made upon unlawful procedure or without a fair trial;\n\n(6) Is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable;\n\n(7) Involves an abuse of discretion.\n\n­­The scope of judicial review in all contested cases, whether or not subject to judicial review pursuant to sections 536.100 to 536.140, and in all cases in which judicial review of decisions of administrative officers or bodies, whether state or local, is now or may hereafter be provided by law, shall in all cases be at least as broad as the scope of judicial review provided for in this subsection.\n\n3. In interpreting a state statute, rule, regulation, or other subregulatory document, a court or an officer hearing an administrative action shall not defer to a state agency's interpretation of such statute, rule, regulation, or other document, and shall interpret the meaning and effect de novo. In actions brought by or against a state agency, after applying all customary tools of interpretation, the court or hearing officer shall decide any remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable interpretation that limits agency power and maximizes individual liberty.\n\n4. Wherever under this section or otherwise the court is entitled to weigh the evidence and determine the facts for itself, the court may hear and consider additional evidence if the court finds that such evidence in the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have been produced or was improperly excluded at the hearing before the agency. Wherever the court is not entitled to weigh the evidence and determine the facts for itself, if the court finds that there is competent and material evidence which, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been produced or was improperly excluded at the hearing before the agency, the court may remand the case to the agency with directions to reconsider the same in the light of such evidence. The court may in any case hear and consider evidence of alleged irregularities in procedure or of unfairness by the agency, not shown in the record.\n\n5. The court shall render judgment affirming, reversing, or modifying the agency's order, and may order the reconsideration of the case in the light of the court's opinion and judgment, and may order the agency to take such further action as it may be proper to require; but the court shall not substitute its discretion for discretion legally vested in the agency, unless the court determines that the agency decision was arbitrary or capricious.\n\n6. Appeals may be taken from the judgment of the court as in other civil cases.\n\n(L. 1945 p. 1504 § 10, A.L. 1953 p. 679, A.L. 2005 H.B. 576, A.L. 2025 S.B. 221)\n\n(1999) Given lack of authority of Administrative Hearing Commission to determine constitutionality of liquor control regulation, review by the Supreme Court is only of the circuit court's judgment.

The report shall consider and include the following:\n\n(1) Whether the rule continues to be necessary, taking into consideration the purpose, scope, and intent of the statute under which the rule was adopted;\n\n(2) Whether the rule is obsolete, taking into consideration the length of time since the rule was modified and the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other relevant factors have changed in the subject area affected by the rule;\n\n(3) Whether the rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other state rules, and to the extent feasible, with federal and local governmental rules;\n\n(4) Whether a less restrictive, more narrowly tailored, or alternative rule could adequately protect the public or accomplish the same statutory purpose;\n\n(5) Whether the rule needs amendment or rescission to reduce regulatory burdens on individuals, businesses, or political subdivisions or eliminate unnecessary paperwork;\n\n(6) Whether the rule incorporates a text or other material by reference and, if so, whether the text or other material incorporated by reference meets the requirements of section 536.031;\n\n(7) For rules that affect small business, the specific public purpose or interest for adopting the rules and any other reasons to justify its continued existence; and\n\n(8) The nature of the comments received by the agency under subsection 2 of this section, a summary of which shall be attached to the report as an appendix and shall include the agency's responses thereto.\n\n5.
