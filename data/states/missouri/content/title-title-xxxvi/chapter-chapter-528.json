After this date, the following rules shall apply:\n\n(1) If all electing cotenants timely pay their apportioned price into court, the court shall issue an order reallocating all the interests of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to them;\n\n(2) If no electing cotenant timely pays its apportioned price, the court shall resolve the partition action under subsection 1 or 2 of section 528.730 as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased; or\n\n(3) If one or more but not all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court, on motion, shall give notice to the electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest remaining and the price for all that interest.\n\n6.

After the twenty-day period, the following rules shall apply:\n\n(1) If only one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall issue an order reallocating the remaining interest to that cotenant. The court shall promptly issue an order reallocating the interests of all of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to such amounts;\n\n(2) If no cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall resolve the partition action under subsection 1 or 2 of section 528.730 as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased; or\n\n(3) If more than one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall reapportion the remaining interest among those paying cotenants based on each paying cotenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interest.

If the court receives a timely request under subsection 7 of this section, the court, after hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations:\n\n(1) A sale authorized under this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under subsections 1 to 6 of this section have been paid into court and those interests have been reallocated among the cotenants as provided in subsections 1 to 6 of this section; and\n\n(2) The purchase price for the interest of a nonappearing cotenant is based on the court's determination of value under section 528.720.\n\n(L. 2019 S.B. 83)",

If all the interests of all cotenants that requested partition by sale are not purchased by other cotenants under section 528.725, or, if after conclusion of the buyout under section 528.725, a cotenant that has requested partition in kind remains, the court shall order partition in kind unless the court, after consideration of the factors listed in section 528.735, finds that partition in kind will result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group. In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated.\n\n2. If the court does not order partition in kind under subsection 1 of this section, the court shall order partition by sale under section 528.740 or, if no cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.\n\n3. If the court orders partition in kind under subsection 1 of this section, the court may require that one or more cotenants pay one or more other cotenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions to the cotenants, shall make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.\n\n4. If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to the cotenants that are unknown, unlocatable, or the subject of a default judgment, if their interests were not bought out under section 528.725, a part of the property representing the combined interests of these cotenants as determined by the court, and that part of the property shall remain undivided.\n\n(L. 2019 S.B. 83)",

In determining, under subsection 1 of section 528.730, whether partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the following:\n\n(1) Whether the heirs' property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;\n\n(2) Whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the value of the property if it were sold as a whole, taking into account the condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;\n\n(3) Evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;\n\n(4) A cotenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;\n\n(5) The lawful use being made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;\n\n(6) The degree to which the cotenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the property; and\n\n(7) Any other relevant factor.\n\n2.

If the court orders a sale of heirs' property, the sale shall be an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the cotenants as a group.\n\n2. If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, no later than ten days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in this state to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in this state to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission. The broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the terms and conditions established by the court. If the court finds that an auction company is more advantageous to the cotenants as a group, it has the discretion to appoint an auction company to conduct the sale required under this subsection.\n\n3. If the broker appointed under subsection 2 of this section obtains within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value:\n\n(1) The broker shall comply with the reporting requirements in section 528.745; and\n\n(2) The sale may be completed in accordance with state law other than sections 528.700 to 528.750.\n\n4. If the broker appointed under subsection 2 of this section does not obtain within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value, the court, after hearing, may:\n\n(1) Approve the highest outstanding offer, if any;\n\n(2) Redetermine the value of the property and order that the property continue to be offered for an additional time; or\n\n(3) Order that the property be sold by sealed bids or at an auction.\n\n5. If the court orders a sale by sealed bids or an auction, the court shall set terms and conditions of the sale. If the court orders a sale, the sale shall be conducted under supreme court rule 96.\n\n6. If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the proceeds.\n\n(L. 2019 S.B. 83)",
