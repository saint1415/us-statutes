If the proceedings seek to affect the lands of persons under conservatorship, the conservators must be made parties defendant. If the present owner of any land to be affected has less estate than a fee, the person having the next vested estate in remainder may at the option of the petitioners be made party defendant; but if such remaindermen are not made parties, their interest shall not be bound by the proceedings.\n\n3. It shall not be necessary to make any persons party defendants in respect to their ownership unless they are either in actual possession of the premises to be affected claiming title or having a title of the premises appearing of record upon the proper records of the county.\n\n4.

A public utility or a rural electric cooperative may only condemn the property of another provider of public utility service, even if the property is used or useful in providing utility services by such provider, if the condemnation is necessary for the public purpose of acquiring a nonexclusive easement or right-of-way across the property of such provider and only if the acquisition will not materially impair or interfere with the current use of such property by the utility or cooperative and will not prevent or materially impair such provider of public utility service from any future expansion of its facilities on such property.\n\n6. If a public utility or rural electric cooperative seeks to condemn the property of another provider of public utility service, and the conditions in subsection 4 of this section do not apply, this section does not limit the condemnation powers otherwise possessed by such public utility or rural electric cooperative.\n\n7. Suits in inverse condemnation or involving dangerous conditions of public property against a municipal corporation established under Article VI, Section 30(a) of the Missouri Constitution shall be brought only in the county where such land or any part thereof lies.\n\n8.

Relocation assistance shall not be provided to any person who purposely resides or locates his business in a redevelopment area solely for the purpose of obtaining relocation benefits.\n\n15. The provisions of sections 523.200 and 523.205 shall apply to land acquisitions under the operation of chapter 99, chapter 100, or chapter 353, filed for approval, approved or amended on or after August 31, 1991, and, as provided by subsection 2 of this section, any other land acquisition by a political subdivision or governmental entity through condemnation proceedings initiated after December 31, 2006.\n\n(L. 1971 H.B. 94 § 2, A.L. 1991 H.B. 502, A.L. 2006 H.B. 1944)",

A condemning authority or the affected property owner may seek a determination as to whether these standards have been met by a court of competent jurisdiction in any condemnation action filed to acquire the owner's property or in an action seeking a declaratory judgment. Upon the filing of such a declaratory judgment or when such a defense is raised in a condemnation proceeding, the circuit court shall give the case preference in the order of hearing to all other cases, except elections cases, to the extent necessary to conclude the case within thirty days of having been filed. Either party may thereafter file an interlocutory appeal of the circuit court's order upholding or rejecting the legislative body's determination. Any subsequent or interlocutory appeal to a higher court on the appeal of the legislative determination shall be given preference and concluded in an expedited manner similar to the manner set forth herein for a hearing in circuit court. An interlocutory appeal shall not stay proceedings in the court unless the court of appeals so orders.\n\n(L. 2006 H.B. 1944)",
