Since the repeal of the Missouri Dram Shop Act in 1934 (Laws of 1933-34, extra session, page 77), it has been and continues to be the policy of this state to follow the common law of England, as declared in section 1.010, to prohibit dram shop liability and to follow the common law rule that furnishing alcoholic beverages is not the proximate cause of injuries inflicted by intoxicated persons.\n\n2. Notwithstanding subsection 1 of this section, a cause of action may be brought by or on behalf of any person who has suffered personal injury or death against any person licensed to sell intoxicating liquor by the drink for consumption on the premises when it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the seller knew or should have known that intoxicating liquor was served to a person under the age of twenty-one years or knowingly served intoxicating liquor to a visibly intoxicated person.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, a person is\"visibly intoxicated\"when inebriated to such an extent that the impairment is shown by significantly uncoordinated physical action or significant physical dysfunction. A person's blood alcohol content does not constitute prima facie evidence to establish that a person is visibly intoxicated within the meaning of this section, but may be admissible as relevant evidence of the person's intoxication.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to provide a right of recovery to a person who suffers injury or death proximately caused by the person's voluntary intoxication unless the person is under the age of twenty-one years. No person over the age of twenty-one years or their dependents, personal representative, and heirs may assert a claim for damages for personal injury or death against a seller of intoxicating liquor by the drink for consumption on the premises arising out of the person's voluntary intoxication.\n\n5. In an action brought pursuant to subsection 2 of this section alleging the sale of intoxicating liquor by the drink for consumption on the premises to a person under the age of twenty-one years, proof that the seller or the seller's agent or employee demanded and was shown a driver's license or official state or federal personal identification card, appearing to be genuine and showing that the minor was at least twenty-one years of age, shall be relevant in determining the relative fault of the seller or seller's agent or employee in the action.\n\n6. No employer may discharge his or her employee for refusing service to a visibly intoxicated person.\n\n(L. 1985 S.B. 345 § 1, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1532)\n\n(2000) Provisions of Missouri's dram shop law that impose liability only upon conviction of sale of liquor to a person under age or to an obviously intoxicated person are an unconstitutional violation of the state's open courts provision, Missouri Constitution Article I, Section 14, because access to the courts is conditioned upon a prosecutor's decision to bring the case.

Such time-limited demand shall be accompanied by:\n\n(1) A list of the names and addresses of health care providers who provided treatment to or evaluation of the claimant or decedent for injuries suffered from the date of injury until the date of the time-limited demand, and HIPAA compliant written authorizations sufficient to allow the liability insurer to obtain such records from the health care providers listed; and\n\n(2) A list of the names and addresses of all the claimant's employers at the time the claimant was first injured until the date of the time-limited demand, and written authorizations sufficient to allow the liability insurer to obtain such records from all employers listed, if the claimant asserts a loss of wages, earnings, compensation, or profits however denominated.\n\n4. If a liability insurer with the right to settle on behalf of an insured receives a time-limited demand, such insurer may accept the time-limited demand by providing written acceptance of the material terms outlined in subsection 2 of this section, delivered or postmarked to the claimant or the claimant's representative within the time period set in the time-limited demand.\n\n5. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a claimant making a time-limited demand from requiring payment within a specified period; provided, however, that such period for payment shall not be less than ten days after the insurer's receipt of a fully executed unconditional release under section 537.060 as specified in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n6. Nothing in this section applies to offers or demands or time-limited demands issued within ninety days of the trial by jury of any claim on which a lawsuit has been filed.\n\n7. In any lawsuit filed by a claimant as an assignee of the tort-feasor or by the tort-feasor for the benefit of the claimant, a time-limited demand that does not comply with the terms of this section shall not be considered as a reasonable opportunity to settle for the insurer and shall not be admissible in any lawsuit alleging extracontractual damages against the tort-feasor's liability insurer.\n\n(L. 2017 H.B. 339 & 714)",

Any person having an unliquidated claim for damages against a tort-feasor, on account of personal injuries, bodily injuries, or death may enter into a contract with such tort-feasor or any insurer on his or her behalf or both if the insurer has refused to withdraw a reservation of rights or declined coverage for such unliquidated claim, whereby, in consideration of the payment of a specified amount, the person asserting the claim agrees that in the event of a judgment against the tort-feasor, neither such person nor any other person, firm, or corporation claiming by or through him or her will levy execution, by garnishment or as otherwise provided by law, except against the specific assets listed in the contract and except against any insurer which insures the legal liability of the tort-feasor for such damage and which insurer is not excepted from execution, garnishment or other legal procedure by such contract. Execution or garnishment proceedings in aid thereof shall lie only as to assets of the tort-feasor specifically mentioned in the contract or the insurer or insurers not excluded in such contract. Such contract, when properly acknowledged by the parties thereto, may be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds in any county where a judgment may be rendered, or in the county of the residence of the tort-feasor, or in both such counties, and if the same is so recorded then such tort-feasor's property, except as to the assets specifically listed in the contract, shall not be subject to any judgment lien as the result of any judgment rendered against the tort-feasor, arising out of the transaction for which the contract is entered into.\n\n2.

No judgment shall be entered against any tort-feasor after such tort-feasor has entered into a contract under this section for at least thirty days after the insurer or insurers have received written notice as provided in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. Any insurer or insurers who receive notice pursuant to this section shall have the unconditional right to intervene in any pending civil action involving the claim for damages within thirty days after receipt of such notice. Upon intervention pursuant to this section, the intervenor shall have all rights afforded to defendants under the Missouri rules of civil procedure and reasonable and sufficient time to meaningfully assert its position including, but not limited to, the right and time to conduct discovery, the right and time to engage in motion practice, and the right to a trial by jury and sufficient time to prepare for trial. No stipulations, scheduling orders, or other orders affecting the rights of an intervenor and entered prior to intervention shall be binding upon the intervenor.

No agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances shall be deemed to be a nuisance, private or public, by any changed conditions in the locality thereof after the facility has been in operation for more than one year, when the facility was not a nuisance at the time the operation began. An agricultural operation protected pursuant to the provisions of this section may reasonably expand its operation in terms of acres or animal units without losing its protected status so long as all county, state, and federal environmental codes, laws, or regulations are met by the agricultural operation. Reasonable expansion shall not be deemed a public or private nuisance, provided the expansion does not create a substantially adverse effect upon the environment or creates a hazard to public health and safety, or creates a measurably significant difference in environmental pressures upon existing and surrounding neighbors because of increased pollution. Reasonable expansion shall not include complete relocation of a farming operation by the owner within or without the present boundaries of the farming operation; however, reasonable expansion of like kind that presently exists, may occur. If a poultry or livestock operation is to maintain its protected status following a reasonable expansion, the operation must ensure that its waste handling capabilities and facilities meet or exceed minimum recommendations of the University of Missouri extension service for storage, processing, or removal of animal waste. The protected status of an agricultural operation, once acquired, shall be assignable, alienable, and inheritable. The protected status of an agricultural operation, once acquired, shall not be waived by the temporary cessation of farming or by diminishing the size of the operation. The provisions of this section shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such agricultural operation or its appurtenances.\n\n2. As used in this section the term\"agricultural operation and its appurtenances\"includes, but is not limited to, any facility used in the production or processing for commercial purposes of crops, livestock, swine, poultry, livestock products, swine products or poultry products.\n\n3. The provisions of this section shall not affect or defeat the right of any person, firm or corporation to recover damages for any injuries sustained by it as a result of the pollution or other change in the quantity or quality of water used by that person, firm or corporation for private or commercial purposes, or as a result of any overflow of land owned by or in the possession of any such person, firm or corporation.\n\n4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any nuisance resulting from an agricultural operation located within the limits of any city, town or village on August 13, 1982.\n\n5. In any nuisance action brought in which an agricultural operation is alleged to be a nuisance, and which is found to be frivolous by the court, the defendant shall recover the aggregate amount of costs and expenses determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred in his behalf in connection with the defense of such action, together with a reasonable amount for attorneys fees.\n\n(L. 1982 S.B. 537 § 1, A.L. 1990 S.B. 686)",

In any action under this subdivision wherein a plaintiff alleges that he was damaged by the negligent, defective or dangerous design of a highway or road, which was designed and constructed prior to September 12, 1977, the public entity shall be entitled to a defense which shall be a complete bar to recovery whenever the public entity can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged negligent, defective, or dangerous design reasonably complied with highway and road design standards generally accepted at the time the road or highway was designed and constructed.\n\n2. The express waiver of sovereign immunity in the instances specified in subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection 1 of this section are absolute waivers of sovereign immunity in all cases within such situations whether or not the public entity was functioning in a governmental or proprietary capacity and whether or not the public entity is covered by a liability insurance for tort.\n\n3. The term\"public entity\"as used in this section shall include any multistate compact agency created by a compact formed between this state and any other state which has been approved by the Congress of the United States.\n\n(L. 1978 H.B. 1650 § 1, A.L. 1985 S.B. 323, A.L. 1989 H.B. 161, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58)\n\n(1988) Law abrogating sovereign immunity is procedural as it creates no new cause of action but only provides remedy for cause of action whose remedy was previously barred and therefore applies retrospectively. Wilkes v. Mo. Highway and Transportation Commission, 762 S.W.2d 27 (Mo.banc).\n\n(1988) Broken down stop sign constituted dangerous condition of government property and sovereign immunity is waived. Donahue v. City of St. Louis, 758 S.W.2d 50 (Mo.banc).\n\n(1988) Placement of a folding partition against a ladder created a dangerous condition of property within meaning of section 537.600, RSMo. Alexander v. State, 756 S.W.2d 539 (Mo.banc).\n\n(1989) Public housing authorities are statutory municipal corporations and exercise only governmental functions which are subject to governmental immunity. Privately owned rental property enrolled in rental assistance program is not \"public property\" and was not within statutory exception to governmental immunity. (Mo.App. W.D.) Tyler v. Housing Auth. of Kansas City, 781 S.W.2d 110.\n\n(1992) The sovereign immunity doctrine is uniquely applicable to governmental entities and is not transferable to an agent of that entity. The public duty doctrine holds that public officers are not liable in tort for injuries or damages sustained by particular individuals that result from a breach of the duty that officers owe to the general public. Automobile accident victim's attempt to intermingle the two doctrines fails. The abrogation of sovereign immunity in no way implicitly abrogated the public duty doctrine. Beaver v. Gosney, 825 S.W.2d 870 (Mo.App.W.D.).\n\n(1992) A medical center, a not-for-profit corporation, which is not controlled by or answerable to public officials, public entities, or public itself, is not a public entity protected by sovereign immunity. Stacy v. Truman Medical Center, 836 S.W.2d 911 (Mo.banc).\n\n(1993) Court finds a direct conflict between the state doctrine of sovereign immunity and the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act to extent public hospital claimed to be immune from \"patient dumping\" claim. Federal act preempted state sovereign immunity doctrine. Helton v. Phelps County Regional Medical Center, 817 F.Supp. 789 (E.D. Mo.).\n\n(1993) Doctrine of sovereign immunity applies to regional planning commission. Where slander is not among the circumstances obligating insurer to pay on behalf of the regional planning under insurance policy, regional planning commission did not waive its sovereign immunity against plaintiff's claim. Balderre v. Beeman, 837 S.W.2d 309 (Mo. App. S.D.).\n\n(1993) Where high speed chase by law enforcement officers resulted in one civilian death and substantial property damage and personal injury to others, statute that waives sovereign immunity for negligent acts or omissions of public employees in operation of motor vehicles in course of employment does not create duty running from individual defendants to either general public or to plaintiffs individually. Boyle v. City of Liberty, Mo., 833 F.Supp. 1436 (W.D. Mo.).\n\n(1993) Plaintiff may have action against city because official immunity doctrine, which provides that public officers are not personally liable for negligent acts related to discretionary duties and performed within scope of their authority, is different legal concept than sovereign immunity doctrine which waives sovereign immunity for injuries resulting from negligent acts of public employees arising out of operation of motorized vehicles. Bachmann v. Welby, 860 S.W.2d 31 (Mo. App. E.D.).\n\n(1993) Statute waives sovereign immunity in certain cases, however, statute does not authorize awarding of costs against state agency. In instances where general assembly waives immunity regarding costs, it explicitly specifies such waivers as it provides in sections 550.020, RSMo, and 536.087, RSMo. Richardson v. State Highway and Transportation Commission, 863 S.W.2d 876 (Mo.banc).\n\n(1999) Doctrine of res ipsa loquitur cannot be used to establish the dangerous-condition exception of this section. Hale ex rel. Hale v. City of Jefferson, 6 S.W.3d 187 (Mo.App.W.D.).\n\n(2001) Section does not bar claims for contribution when compensatory damage claims for injuries result from dangerous conditions on public property and a joint obligation on the liability is shared by tort-feasors. McNeill Trucking Company, Inc. v. Missouri State Highway and Transportation Commission, 35 S.W.3d 846 (Mo.banc).\n\n(2006) Section waives governmental employer's sovereign immunity for its employees' negligent operation of motor vehicle; as official immunity is personal to the governmental employee, the employer is not shielded from liability based upon respondeat superior. Davis v. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, 193 S.W.3d 760 (Mo.banc).\n\n(2009) Operation of a city-owned emergency medical service is a governmental function, even though the city charges a fee for the service; that service provides a general public benefit and serves the public health and welfare. Richardson v. City of St. Louis, 293 S.W.3d 133 (Mo.App. E.D.).\n\n(2016) Charter school's participation in Missouri public entity risk management fund did not operate as a waiver of sovereign immunity and thus school bus driver's wrongful discharge claim on discrimination on basis of sexual orientation was barred. Moore v. Lift for Life Academy, Inc., 489 S.W.3d 843 (Mo.App.E.D.).\n\n(2022) To satisfy the \"public entity's property\" element of \"dangerous condition\" waiver under section, plaintiff need not demonstrate a public entity possesses exclusive possession and control of the property if the public entity is the legal owner of the property. Allen v. 32nd Judicial Circuit, 638 S.W.3d 880 (Mo.banc).",

Seventy-four percent of all payments received by the tort victims' compensation fund regardless of source or designation shall, upon appropriation, be appropriated to the division of workers' compensation to assist uncompensated tort victims and shall be used for no other purpose. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080, any balance remaining in the budget of the division of workers' compensation for compensation of uncompensated tort victims shall not be transferred to general revenue but shall remain in the fund. Moneys in the tort victims' compensation fund shall not be used to pay any portion of a refund mandated by Article X, Section 18 of the Constitution.\n\n2. The division of workers' compensation shall, pursuant to the provisions of sections 537.678 to 537.693, have jurisdiction to determine and award compensation to or on behalf of uncompensated tort victims. The requirement that the uncompensated tort victim has obtained a final judgment may be waived by the division based upon the tort-feasor's bankruptcy, inability to identify the tort-feasor or inability to obtain service of process on the tort-feasor after making a good faith effort to do so or the claim against tort-feasor has been settled for the insurance policy limits available to cover the liability of such tort-feasor and such policy limits are inadequate in light of the injury suffered by the tort victim. The division is not required to award compensation, nor is it required to award the full amount claimed. The division shall base its award of compensation upon independent verification obtained during its investigation. In no case shall the amount paid to the individual exceed the lesser of either the net award granted by the court or jury, or the amount remaining in the tort victims' compensation fund, provided, however, that no award shall exceed three hundred thousand dollars.\n\n3. Claims shall be made by filing an application for compensation with the division. The division shall furnish an application form which shall include:\n\n(1) The name and address of the uncompensated tort victim;\n\n(2) If the claimant is not the uncompensated tort victim, the name and address of the claimant and relationship to the victim, the name and address of any dependents of the victim, and the extent to which each is so dependent;\n\n(3) The date and nature of the tort on which the application for compensation is based;\n\n(4) The date and court in which a judgment was rendered against the tort-feasor, including the judgment amount specifying medical costs, if available. If no final judgment was obtained and the claimant is requesting a waiver pursuant to subsection 2 of this section, the application shall include a statement establishing the basis for a waiver;\n\n(5) The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the victim, the names and addresses of those giving medical and hospital treatment to the victim and whether death resulted;\n\n(6) The loss to the claimant or a dependent resulting from the injury or death;\n\n(7) The amount of benefits, payments or awards, if any, payable from any source that the claimant or dependent has received or for which the claimant or dependent is eligible as a result of the injury or death;\n\n(8) Releases by the claimant authorizing any reports, documents and other information relating to the matters specified pursuant to this section to be obtained by the division; and\n\n(9) Any other information as the division determines is necessary.\n\n4. In addition to the application, the division may require that the claimant submit materials substantiating the facts stated in the application.\n\n5. If the division finds that an application does not contain the required information or that the facts stated therein have not been substantiated, it shall notify the claimant in writing of the specific additional items or information or materials required and that the claimant has thirty days from the date of mailing in which to furnish those items to the division. Unless a claimant requests and is granted an extension of time by the division, the division may reject, without prejudice to refiling of another application for the same matter, the claim of the claimant for failure to file the additional information or materials within the specified time. Extensions of time to file such additional information shall be freely granted.\n\n6. The claimant may file an amended application or additional substantiating materials to correct inadvertent errors or omissions at any time before the division has completed its consideration of the original application.\n\n7. Any state or local agency, including a prosecuting attorney or law enforcement agency, shall make available without cost to the fund, all reports, files and other appropriate information that the division requests in order to make a determination that a claimant is eligible for an award pursuant to sections 537.675 to 537.693.\n\n8. Any notice required pursuant to sections 537.675 to 537.693, with the exception of the lien notice required by subsection 3 of section 537.675, shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the party's last known address or to the last known address of the party's attorney or other legal representative.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 107)",

An uncompensated tort victim that is found personally liable on a cross-complaint of tort, or found to have been contributorily or comparatively negligent, shall only be eligible to receive compensation to the extent of the favorable net amount awarded by the judge or jury. No uncompensated tort victim or other eligible claimant shall be denied compensation solely because such person is a relative of the tort-feasor or was living with the tort-feasor as a family or household member at the time of the injury or death. The division, however, may award compensation to a victim or other eligible claimant only if the division can reasonably determine that the tort-feasor will receive no substantial economic benefit or unjust enrichment from the compensation.\n\n3. The division may waive the requirements of paragraph (e) of subdivision (5) of subsection 1 of section 537.675 if it determines that the interest of justice would be served by doing so.\n\n4. In the case of an uncompensated tort victim or other eligible claimant who is incarcerated as a result of a conviction of a crime not related to the incident which is the basis for the claimant's application:\n\n(1) The division shall suspend all proceedings and payments until such time as the uncompensated tort victim or other eligible claimant is released from incarceration;\n\n(2) The division shall notify the claimant at the time the proceedings are suspended of the right to reactivate the claim within six months of his or her release from incarceration;\n\n(3) The uncompensated tort victim or other eligible claimant may file an application to request that the case be reactivated not later than six months after the date he or she is released from incarceration. Failure to file such request within the six-month period shall serve as a bar to any recovery.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 107)",

A claim for compensation may be filed by a person eligible for compensation or, if the person is an incapacitated or disabled person, or a minor, by the person's spouse, parent, conservator or guardian.\n\n2. A claim shall be filed not later than two years after the judgment upon which it is based becomes final and all appeals are final. If there is no judgment, claims must be filed within time limits prescribed pursuant to section 516.120, except for cases resulting in death, in which case claims must be filed within time limits prescribed pursuant to section 537.100.\n\n3. Each claim shall be filed in person or by mail. The division shall investigate such claim prior to the opening of formal proceedings. The director of the division shall assign an administrative law judge, associate administrative law judge or legal advisor within the division to hear any claim for compensation filed. The claimant shall be notified of the date and time of any hearing on the claim. In determining the amount of compensation for which a claimant is eligible, the division shall:\n\n(1) Consider the facts stated on the application filed pursuant to section 537.678;\n\n(2) Obtain a copy of the final judgment, if any, from the appropriate court;\n\n(3) Determine the amount of the loss to the claimant, or the victim's survivors or dependents; and\n\n(4) If there is no final judgment, determine the degree or extent to which the victim's acts or conduct provoked, incited or contributed to the injuries or death of the victim.\n\n4. The claimant may present evidence and testimony on his or her own behalf or may retain counsel.\n\n5. Prior to any hearing, the person filing a claim shall submit reports, if available, from all hospitals, physicians or surgeons who treated or examined the victim for the injury for which compensation is sought. If, in the opinion of the division, an examination of the injured victim or a report on the cause of death of the victim would be of material aid, the division may appoint a duly qualified, impartial physician to make an examination and report. A finding of the judge or jury in the underlying case shall be considered as evidence.\n\n6. Each and every payment shall be exempt from attachment, garnishment or any other remedy available to creditors for the collection of a debt, provided however, this section shall not in any way affect the right of any attorney who represents or represented any claimant to collect any fee or expenses to which he or she is entitled.\n\n7. Payments of compensation shall not be made directly to any person legally incompetent to receive them but shall be made to the parent, guardian or conservator for the benefit of such minor, disabled or incapacitated person.\n\n8. For payment of all claims from the fund, the division shall determine the aggregate amount of all awards made on those claims filed during an annual claims period. Such determination shall be made on or before the thirtieth day of June in the next succeeding year. If the aggregate value of the awards does not exceed the total amount of money in the fund, then the awards shall be paid in full on or before the thirtieth day of September in the next succeeding year. If the aggregate value of the awards does exceed the total amount of money in the fund, then the awards shall be paid on a pro rata basis on or before the thirtieth day of September in the next succeeding year.\n\n9. If there are no funds available, then no claim shall be paid until funds have accumulated in the tort victims' compensation fund and have been appropriated to the division for payment to uncompensated tort victims. When sufficient funds become available for payment of claims of uncompensated tort victims, awards that have been determined but have not been paid shall be paid in chronological order with the oldest paid first, based upon the date on which the application was filed with the division. Any award pursuant to this subsection that cannot be paid due to a lack of funds appropriated for payment of claims of uncompensated tort victims shall not constitute a claim against the state.\n\n10. In the event there are no funds available for payment of claims, then the division may suspend all action related to valuing claims and granting awards until such time as funds in excess of one hundred thousand dollars have accumulated in the tort victims' compensation fund, at which time the division shall resume its claim processing duties.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 107, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1965)",

The attorney general may enforce the subrogation interest, and may file suit to enforce that right of subrogation.\n\n2.

The claimant shall retain, as trustee for the division, so much of the recovered funds as necessary to reimburse the Missouri tort victims' compensation fund to the extent that compensation was paid to the claimant from that fund.\n\n3. If a claimant initiates any legal proceeding to recover restitution or damages or enforce the underlying judgment related to the tort upon which the claim is based, or if the claimant enters into negotiations to receive any proceeds in settlement or a claim for restitution or damages related to the tort, the claimant shall give the division written notice within fifteen days of the filing of the action or entering into negotiations. The division may intervene in the proceeding of a claimant to enforce its subrogation interest. If a claimant fails to give such written notice to the division within the stated time period or prior to any attempt by claimant to reach a negotiated settlement of claims for recovery of damages related to the tort upon which the claim is based, the division's right of subrogation to receive or recover funds from claimant, to the extent that compensation was awarded by the division, shall not be reduced in any amount or percentage by the costs incurred by claimant attributable to such legal proceedings or settlement, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, investigative costs or court costs; however, if the claimant provides written notice to the division as required in this section then the subrogation interest of the division shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage that the attorney's fees and expenses incurred by the claimant bears to the total recovery.\n\n4.

All public entities in Missouri shall have the option of participating in the fund and making annual contributions to the fund in the amount determined by the board in accordance with the provisions of section 379.470 relating to rates established by insurers.

For any year in which any public entity does not make a yearly contribution to the fund, the board of trustees of the fund shall not be responsible, in any way, for negotiating the settlement of any claim arising from an occurrence in that year, providing any defense of any claim arising from an occurrence in that year, making any payment on any claim arising from an occurrence in that year, or making any payment on any judgment on any claim arising from an occurrence in that year.
