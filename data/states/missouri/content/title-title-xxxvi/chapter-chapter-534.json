When any person willfully and without force holds over any lands, tenements or other possessions, after the termination of the time for which they were demised or let to the person, or the person under whom such person claims; or after a mortgage or deed of trust has been foreclosed and the person has received written notice of a foreclosure; or at least ten business days have elapsed after the date of the notice described in subsection 3 of this section; or when premises are occupied incident to the terms of employment and the employee holds over after the termination of such employment; or when any person wrongfully and without force, by disseisin, shall obtain and continue in possession of any lands, tenements or other possessions, and after demand made, in writing, for the delivery of such possession of the premises by the person having the legal right to such possession, or the person's agent or attorney, shall refuse or neglect to vacate such possession, such person is guilty of an\"unlawful detainer\".\n\n2. In any case where a foreclosed property is occupied prior to the foreclosure by a person who was a residential tenant, known in this section as the occupant, not in violation of the provisions of section 441.020, then after the foreclosure sale, the new owner of the property shall give the occupant notice, as described in subsection 3 of this section, that the sale has occurred, that they are the new owner, and if said owner seeks possession from the occupant that the occupant has not less than ten business days from the date of this notice to vacate the premises. No unlawful detainer action or any other action seeking possession may be commenced against the occupant within ten business days following the date of notice by the new owner that the foreclosure sale has occurred. Nothing in this section creates a tenancy between the new owner and the occupant. This section does not preclude the new owner from entering into an agreement with the occupant that allows the occupant to remain in the foreclosed property.\n\n3. The notice required in subsection 2 of this section shall be sent by certified or registered mail if the name of the occupant is known to the new owner. If the name of the occupant is not known to the new owner then the notice shall be sent by regular mail and addressed to \"occupant\". The envelope containing such notice shall have the following words printed on the envelope face: \"Notice to Occupant Following Foreclosure\". A notice shall also be posted on the door of the premises where the occupant resides. The notices required in this subsection shall contain in substance the following text:\n\nAttention Occupant: (name of the new owner of the foreclosed property) is now the owner of the property which you had been renting or leasing at (address of foreclosed property, including apartment number, if applicable) after purchasing it at a trustee's foreclosure sale on (date of foreclosure sale). Unless you agree with (new owner) to a rental or lease agreement for the premises, (new owner), on or after (number not less than ten) business days following the date of this notice, may seek a court order or judgment to have you removed from the premises.

The assertion of sufficient evidence that the person or persons are unlawfully occupying property containing a residential dwelling shall constitute good cause for purposes of this section. The verified petition shall set forth the following:\n\n(a) The petitioner is the property owner or authorized agent of the property owner;\n\n(b) The property that is being occupied includes a residential dwelling;\n\n(c) An unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants have entered and remain or continue to reside on the property owner's property;\n\n(d) The real property was not open to members of the public at the time the unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants entered;\n\n(e) The unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants are occupying the property without the permission of the property owner and are not guests of the property owner nor otherwise authorized to make use of the property;\n\n(f) The property owner has directed the unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants to leave the property and the unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants have failed or refused to vacate the premises;\n\n(g) The property has not been leased to any person for three consecutive months, and the unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants are not current or former tenants of the property pursuant to any agreement with the property owner;\n\n(h) The unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants are not immediate family members of the property owner; and\n\n(i) There is no pending litigation related to the real property between the property owner and any known unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants.\n\n(2) An ex parte order to have the unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants removed from property containing a residential dwelling entered by the court shall take effect when entered and shall remain in effect until there is valid service of process and a hearing is held on the motion. Such hearing shall be held within forty-eight hours of filing the verified petition unless good cause is shown for a delay. The court shall deny the ex parte order and dismiss the petition if the petitioner is not authorized to seek relief or does not show good cause.\n\n(3) Failure to serve an ex parte order on the respondent shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such order.\n\n6. Any ex parte order granted under this section shall be to protect the petitioner from trespass by an unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants and may include such terms as the court reasonably deems necessary to ensure the petitioner's safety including, but not limited to:\n\n(1) Restraining the respondent from committing or threatening to commit any act of violence, molestation, stalking, assault, or disturbing the peace of the petitioner or the petitioner's property, including violence against a pet;\n\n(2) Restraining the respondent from entering the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit or coming within a certain proximity of the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit; and\n\n(3) Restraining the respondent from communicating with the petitioner in any manner or through any medium.\n\n7. When the court has, after a hearing on the petition, issued an order for relief to permanently exclude an unlawful occupant or unlawful occupants from the petitioner's property, it may additionally:\n\n(1) Permanently restrain the respondent from committing or threatening to commit any act of violence, molestation, stalking, assault, or disturbing the peace of the petitioner or the petitioner's property, including violence against a pet;\n\n(2) Permanently restrain the respondent from entering the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit or coming within a certain proximity of the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit;\n\n(3) Permanently restrain the respondent from communicating with the petitioner in any manner or through any medium;\n\n(4) Permanently expel the respondent from occupying the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit;\n\n(5) Permanently expel the respondent's personal property from the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit;\n\n(6) Order the respondent to pay all costs of repair to the petitioner's premises or dwelling unit relating to damages caused by the respondent;\n\n(7) Order the respondent to pay all costs associated with service of any ex parte order authorized against the respondent; or\n\n(8) Order the respondent to pay court costs.\n\n8. A verified petition seeking an ex parte order under this section shall contain allegations relating to those orders and shall pray for the orders desired.\n\n9. Once the court grants an order under this section, the sheriff of the county or city not within a county in which the property is located shall enforce such order by removing the respondent from the property.\n\n10. If appropriate, the sheriff may arrest any person found in the dwelling for trespass, outstanding warrants, or any other legal cause.\n\n11. The sheriff is entitled to the same fee for the service of the ex parte order granted under this section as if the sheriff were serving a writ of possession under section 57.280. After the sheriff serves the order, the property owner or authorized agent may request that the sheriff stand by to keep the peace while the property owner or agent of the property owner changes the locks and removes the personal property of the unlawful occupants from the premises to or near the property line. When such a request is made, the sheriff may charge a reasonable hourly rate, and the person requesting the sheriff to stand by and keep the peace is responsible for paying the reasonable hourly rate set by the sheriff. The sheriff shall not be liable to the unlawful occupant or occupants or to any other party for the loss, destruction, or damage of property. The property owner or his or her authorized agent shall not be liable to an unlawful occupant or any other party for the loss, destruction, or damage to the personal property unless the removal was wrongful.\n\n12. A person may bring a civil cause of action if the person was removed from the property under this section without just cause. Such person may seek restored possession to the real property, actual damages to personal property when personal property was removed, statutory damages in the amount of one thousand dollars, and reimbursement of court costs. Any damages authorized under this subsection shall be offset by any damages to the real property inflicted by the person who was removed from the real property without just cause. Such damages to real property shall be proven by the property owner. Awards of actual damages shall not exceed the value of the damaged personal property.\n\n13. The provisions of this section do not limit the rights of a property owner or limit the authority of a law enforcement officer to arrest an unlawful occupant for trespassing, vandalism, theft, or other crimes.\n\n14. All proceedings under this section are in addition to any other available civil or criminal remedies, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section.\n\n15. (1) The court shall retain jurisdiction over the ex parte order or full order of protection issued under this section for its entire duration. The court may schedule compliance review hearings to monitor the respondent's compliance with the order.\n\n(2) The terms of the ex parte order or full order of protection issued under this section are enforceable by all remedies available at law for the enforcement of a judgment, and the court may punish a respondent who willfully violates the ex parte order to the same extent as provided by law for contempt of the court in any other suit or proceeding cognizable by the court.\n\n(L. 2024 H.B. 2062)",

When a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a party, against whom an ex parte order under section 534.602 has been entered and who has notice of such order entered, has committed an act in violation of such order, the law enforcement officer shall arrest the offending party-respondent regardless of whether the violation occurred in the presence of the arresting law enforcement officer.\n\n2. In an arrest in which a law enforcement officer acted in good faith reliance on this section, the arresting and assisting law enforcement officers and their employing entities and superiors shall be immune from liability in any civil action alleging false arrest, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution.\n\n3. A violation of the terms and conditions of an ex parte order under section 534.602 shall be a class A misdemeanor. For the purposes of this subsection, in addition to the notice provided by actual service of the order, a party is deemed to have notice of an ex parte order under section 534.602 if:\n\n(1) The law enforcement officer responding to a call of a violation of an ex parte order under section 534.602 presented a copy of the ex parte order to the respondent; or\n\n(2) Notice is given by actual communication to the respondent in a manner reasonably likely to advise the respondent.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as creating a civil cause of action for damages to enforce the provisions set forth in this section.\n\n(L. 2024 H.B. 2062)",
