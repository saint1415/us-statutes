General rule, effect of disclaimer. —Any individual to whom property or an interest therein is donatively transferred by any means, including a transfer resulting from another disclaimer, may disclaim all or any portion of the transfer. Unless the terms of the transfer otherwise provide, the disclaimer shall cause the terms of the transfer to be applied to the disclaimed transfer and to any future interests taking effect thereafter as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the transfer. The presumption of a disclaimant's death does not prevent recognition of the disclaimant's later born children and their issue, assuming they have rights after all proper acceleration has taken place, nor does it prevent recognition of future and other interests of the disclaimant which are not disclaimed. For all purposes the disclaimed interest is deemed to have passed directly from the transferor to the ultimate taker or takers and is not subject to the claim of any creditor of the disclaimant. A disclaimed portion of a transfer passes to the same ultimate taker or takers and in the same proportions as in the case of a disclaimer of all of the transfer.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 265)",

A disclaimer is made by a writing showing an unconditional refusal to accept a transfer, or a portion thereof, signed by the disclaimant, or representative, and delivered on or before nine months after the transfer, or by any later time provided in the particular case or pursuant to other provisions of this chapter, and before any acceptance of the disclaimed interest. Delivery of a disclaimer may be accomplished by delivery to the transferor, the transferor's personal representative or other legal representative, or the holder of the legal title to the property to which the interest related. A disclaimer involving an estate or property within the jurisdiction of the probate division of a circuit court may be filed in that division.\n\n2. The right to disclaim exists notwithstanding any intention to the contrary expressed by the transferor and notwithstanding any limitation on the disclaimant such as a spendthrift provision or similar restriction.\n\n(L. 1997 S.B. 265)",

Adjustments between principal and income permitted by trustee, factors to be considered — no adjustment permitted, when. —1. A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or shall be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying subsection 1 of section 469.403, that the trustee is unable to comply with subsection 2 of section 469.403.\n\n2. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection 1 of this section, a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent relevant:\n\n(1) The nature, purpose and expected duration of the trust;\n\n(2) The intent of the settlor;\n\n(3) The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries;\n\n(4) The needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital;\n\n(5) The assets held in the trust, including the extent to which such assets consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property, and the extent to which such assets are used by a beneficiary, and whether such assets were purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor;\n\n(6) The net amount allocated to income pursuant to sections 469.401 to 469.467, other than this section, and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;\n\n(7) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income, or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;\n\n(8) The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and\n\n(9) The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.\n\n3. A trustee may not make an adjustment:\n\n(1) That diminishes the income interest in a trust which requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment;\n\n(2) That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;\n\n(3) That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;\n\n(4) From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust to the extent that the existence of the power to adjust would change the character of the amount set aside for federal income, gift or estate tax purposes;\n\n(5) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;\n\n(6) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;\n\n(7) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or\n\n(8) If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly.\n\n4. If subdivision (5), (6), (7) or (8) of subsection 3 of this section applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.\n\n5. A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection 1 of this section, or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subdivisions (1) to (6) or subdivision (8) of subsection 3 of this section, or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection 3 of this section. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.\n\n6. Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection 1 of this section.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 241)",

(1) If the provisions of this section apply to a trust, the unitrust amount determined for each accounting year of the trust shall be a percentage between three and five percent of the average net fair market value of the trust, as of the first day of the trust's current accounting year. The percentage applicable to a trust shall be that percentage specified by the terms of the governing instrument or by the election made in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this section.\n\n(2) The unitrust amount for the current accounting year computed pursuant to this section shall be proportionately reduced for any distributions, in whole or in part, other than distributions of the unitrust amount, and for any payments of expenses, including debts, disbursements and taxes, from the trust within a current accounting year that the trustee determines to be material and substantial, and shall be proportionately increased for the receipt, other than a receipt that represents a return on investment, of any additional property into the trust within a current accounting year.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, the net fair market values of the assets held in the trust on the first business day of a prior accounting quarter shall be adjusted to reflect any reduction, in the case of a distribution or payment, or increase, in the case of a receipt, for the prior accounting year pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, as if the distribution, payment or receipt had occurred on the first day of the prior accounting year.\n\n(4) In the case of a short accounting period, the trustee shall prorate the unitrust amount on a daily basis.\n\n(5) In the case where the net fair market value of an asset held in the trust has been incorrectly determined in any quarter, the unitrust amount shall be increased in the case of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to the difference between the unitrust amount determined based on the correct valuation of the asset and the unitrust amount originally determined.\n\n2. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Average net fair market value\", a rolling average of the fair market value of the assets held in the trust on the first business day of the lessor of the number of accounting quarters of the trust from the date of inception of the trust to the determination of the trust's average net fair market value, or twelve accounting quarters of the trust, regardless of whether this section applied to the ascertainment of net income for all valuation quarters;\n\n(2)\"Current accounting year\", the accounting period of the trust for which the unitrust amount is being determined.\n\n3. In determining the average net fair market value of the assets held in the trust, there shall not be included the value of:\n\n(1) Any residential property or any tangible personal property that, as of the first business day of the current valuation year, one or more income beneficiaries of the trust have or had the right to occupy, or have or had the right to possess or control, other than in a capacity as trustee, and instead the right of occupancy or the right to possession or control shall be deemed to be the unitrust amount with respect to the residential property or the tangible personal property; or\n\n(2) Any asset specifically given to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust and the return on investment on that asset, which return on investment shall be distributable to the beneficiary.\n\n4. In determining the average net fair market value of the assets held in the trust pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the trustee shall, not less often than annually, determine the fair market value of each asset of the trust that consists primarily of real property or other property that is not traded on a regular basis in an active market by appraisal or other reasonable method or estimate, and that determination, if made reasonably and in good faith, shall be conclusive as to all persons interested in the trust. Any claim based on a determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be barred if not asserted in a judicial proceeding brought by any beneficiary with any interest whatsoever in the trust within two years after the trustee has sent a report to all qualified beneficiaries that adequately discloses the facts constituting the claim. The rules set forth in subsection 2 of section 469.409 shall apply to the barring of claims pursuant to this subsection.\n\n5. This section shall apply to the following trusts:\n\n(1) Any trust created after August 28, 2001, with respect to which the terms of the trust clearly manifest an intent that this section apply;\n\n(2) Any trust created under an instrument that became irrevocable on, before, or after August 28, 2001, if the trustee, in the trustee's discretion, elects to have this section apply unless the instrument creating the trust specifically prohibits an election under this subdivision. The trustee shall deliver notice to all qualified beneficiaries and the settlor of the trust, if he or she is then living, of the trustee's intent to make such an election at least sixty days before making that election. The trustee shall have sole authority to make the election. Section 469.402 shall apply for all purposes of this subdivision. An action or order by any court shall not be required. The election shall be made by a signed writing delivered to the settlor of the trust, if he or she is then living, and to all qualified beneficiaries. The election is irrevocable, unless revoked by order of the court having jurisdiction of the trust. The election may specify the percentage used to determine the unitrust amount pursuant to this section, provided that such percentage is between three and five percent, or if no percentage is specified, then that percentage shall be three percent. In making an election pursuant to this subsection, the trustee shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions as apply to an adjustment between income and principal pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 of section 469.405; and\n\n(3) No action of any kind based on an election made by a trustee pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be brought against the trustee by any beneficiary of that trust three years from the effective date of that election.\n\n6. (1) Once the provisions of this section become applicable to a trust, the net income of the trust shall be the unitrust amount.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise provided by the governing instrument, the unitrust amount distributed each year shall be paid from the following sources for that year up to the full value of the unitrust amount in the following order:\n\n(a) Net income as determined if the trust were not a unitrust;\n\n(b) Other ordinary income as determined for federal income tax purposes;\n\n(c) Assets of the trust principal for which there is a readily available market value; and\n\n(d) Other trust principal.\n\n(3) Additionally, the trustee may allocate to trust income for each taxable year of the trust, or portion thereof:\n\n(a) Net short-term capital gain described in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Section 1222(5), for such year, or portion thereof, but only to the extent that the amount so allocated together with all other amounts to trust income, as determined under the provisions of this chapter without regard to this section, for such year, or portion thereof, does not exceed the unitrust amount for such year, or portion thereof;\n\n(b) Net long-term capital gain described in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Section 1222(7), for such year, or portion thereof, but only to the extent that the amount so allocated together with all other amounts, including amounts described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, allocated to trust income for such year, or portion thereof, does not exceed the unitrust amount for such year, or portion thereof.\n\n7. A trust with respect to which this section applies on August 28, 2011, may calculate the unitrust amount in accordance with the provisions of this section, as it existed either before or after such date, as the trustee of such trust shall determine in a writing kept with the records of the trust in the trustee's discretion.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 241, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1151 merged with S.B. 742, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1511, A.L. 2009 H.B. 239, A.L. 2011 S.B. 59)",

The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins shall be allocated to principal and the balance shall be allocated to income.\n\n3. An item of income or an obligation is due on the date a payment is required. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of sections 469.401 to 469.467. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which section 469.423 applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that shall be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.\n\n(L. 2001 H.B. 241, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1511)\n\n*Word \"subsection\" appears in original rolls.",
