Application, when — effect on pending proceedings and rights. —This act*shall apply to the estates of persons whose deaths occur on or after January 1, 1981. The procedures herein prescribed shall govern all proceedings in probate then pending, except to the extent that, in the opinion of the court, their application in particular proceedings or parts thereof would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure shall apply. No act done in any proceeding commenced before January 1, 1981, and no accrued right shall be impaired by its provisions. When a right is acquired, extinguished or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period of time which has commenced to run by the provision of any statute in force before this act*takes effect, such provision shall remain in force and be deemed a part of the probate code with respect to such right except as otherwise provided therein.\n\n(L. 1980 S.B. 637)\n\nEffective 1-01-81\n\n*This act was known as the \"Probate Code\", which includes chapters 472, 473 and 474.\n\n(1955) Will construed and words \"descendants of a deceased child\" of testator held to include an adopted child of testator's deceased son. Hayes v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. (Mo.), 280 S.W.2d 649.\n\n(1958) Devise of undivided one-half interest in realty to testator's son for life and at his death to his children absolutely but if he should die without issue living then to other son for life and at his death to other son's \"heirs at law\" was construed according to statute of descent and distribution in effect when second life tenant died rather than statute in effect at execution of will and testator's death and thus widow of second life tenant took one-half of the undivided one-half interest against contention that testator indicated intent that land go to his descendants. Thomas v. Higginbotham (Mo.), 318 S.W.2d 234.\n\n(1959) Evidence held to establish domicile in state of Louisiana by prior resident of this state who had died, for the purpose of determining where his estate should be dispersed. In re Toler's Estate (Mo.), 325 S.W.2d 755.\n\n(1965) As used in subsection 2 of § 475.320, the word \"debts\" is the substantial equivalent of \"claims\", which is defined in this section, subdivision (4), as including liabilities of the decedent which survive whether arising in contract or in tort or otherwise, funeral expenses, the expense of a tombstone and costs, and expenses of administrator. State v. Hollenbeck (A.), 394 S.W.2d 82.\n\n(1974) Provision in will that executor gave to pastor of a named church a sum for masses to be said entitled the pastor to receive as a gift personal property and he was a \"legatee\" and a necessary party to suit to set aside will. Kane v. Mercantile Trust Co. National Association (Mo.), 513 S.W.2d 362.",

Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all notices required by this code or the court to be served upon any person shall be served as the court directs, by rule or otherwise, in such manner and at such time as to constitute reasonable notice, in any of the following manners:\n\n(1) By delivering to the person, including a minor or a disabled or incapacitated person not known to have a legally appointed guardian or conservator, a copy of the notice personally or by leaving a copy at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of his family over the age of fifteen years, or by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by appointment or required by law to receive service of process;\n\n(2) By publishing a copy of the notice in some newspaper qualified to publish legal notices under chapter 493 and having general circulation within the county in which the court is held for the time required by law or court rule or order. If no time is fixed by law or by rule of court, the notice shall be published once each week for four consecutive weeks, the last insertion being at least seven days before the hearing.

If there is no qualified newspaper published in the county, the notice shall be published in some qualified newspaper published in an adjoining county which has a general circulation within the county in which the court is held or the notice shall be given by posting copies thereof in ten public places in the county as the court directs. If a notice, which is required to be published once a week for more than one time, is published in a daily newspaper, each publication after the first shall appear on the same day of the week on which the first publication was made;\n\n(3) By registered or certified mail, addressed to the person to be notified at his address within the United States, deposited in the United States mail, with all postage charges prepaid, and, if ordered by the court, with a return receipt requested;\n\n(4) By ordinary mail, deposited in the United States mail with all postage charges prepaid at the first class rate, in a sealed envelope or on a post or postal card, properly addressed, bearing the name and return address of the sender and otherwise inscribed in accordance with the regulations of the United States Postal Service to require a return thereof to the sender upon nondelivery to the addressee;\n\n(5) By any combination of the above or as may be provided by the rules of civil procedure.\n\n3. Service by publication is notice to all heirs and devisees, whether known or unknown or whether residents or nonresidents of this state, spouses and to all creditors and other persons interested in the estate.\n\n4. Provisions in this code for notice to interested persons, other than by publication, do not require such notice to creditors unless otherwise specifically required by the code or by the court.\n\n5. Service of notice upon a minor or a disabled or incapacitated person having a legally appointed guardian or conservator, if the fact of the guardianship or conservatorship is known to the person requiring such service or is disclosed by the court files or records, shall be made by serving such guardian or conservator in the manner provided herein for service upon other persons. Service upon a corporation may be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons on corporations in civil actions.\n\n6. In all cases where service by publication is required but personal service or service by registered or certified mail is not ordered, all interested persons whose names and addresses appear in the court files or records, including creditors only when ordered by the court, shall be served by ordinary mail. Failure in any such case to mail any notice or failure of any interested person to receive any mailed notice does not invalidate any order of the court or deprive the court of jurisdiction.\n\n7. Personal service and service by registered or certified mail may be made by any competent witness, except that service by mail of any process, order or notice issued by the court shall be made by the clerk, or, if personal service is required, by the sheriff. Service by publication and by ordinary mail, except those required by section 473.587, shall be made by the clerk when requested in writing by the party requiring same, and when furnished with the necessary information therefor.\n\n8.
