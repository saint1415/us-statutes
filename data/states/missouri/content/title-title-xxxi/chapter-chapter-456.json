As used in this section,\"qualified spousal trust\"means a trust:\n\n(1) The settlors of which are married to each other at the time of the creation of the trust; and\n\n(2) The terms of which provide that during the joint lives of the settlors or the life of the sole surviving settlor all property transferred to, or held by, the trustee are:\n\n(a) Held and administered in one trust for the benefit of both settlors, which may be revocable by either settlor or both settlors while either or both are alive, and by one settlor after the death or incapacity of the other, and each settlor having the right to receive distributions of income or principal, whether mandatory or within the discretion of the trustee, from the entire trust for the joint lives of the settlors and for the survivor's life; or\n\n(b) Held and administered in two or more separate shares of one trust for the benefit of each or both of the settlors, with the trust revocable by each settlor with respect to that settlor's separate share of that trust without the participation or consent of the other settlor, and each settlor having the right to receive distributions of income or principal, whether mandatory or within the discretion of the trustee, from that settlor's separate share for that settlor's life; or\n\n(c) Held and administered under the terms and conditions contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subdivision.\n\n2. A qualified spousal trust may contain any other trust terms that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, including, without limitation, a discretionary power to distribute trust property to a person in addition to a settlor.\n\n3.

Under such circumstances, the personal representative of the powerholder may either exercise the power in favor of the powerholder's estate, if the estate is a permissible appointee, or disclaim the power as provided by section 456.1080.\n\n(2) If the power is neither exercised nor disclaimed by the powerholder's personal representative as stated, the power shall lapse at the earlier of the end of the period for making a disclaimer under other applicable Missouri laws or the end of the period in which the power is valid under its terms.\n\n(3) The terms of a general power of appointment providing that \"this power of appointment shall survive the death of the powerholder\", or words of similar import, shall be sufficient to extend the power after the death of a powerholder in the hands of his or her personal representative in this subsection.\n\n(4) In addition to the protections otherwise afforded under applicable law, the personal representative shall not be individually liable for his or her actions or inactions under this subsection if he or she does not have actual knowledge of the power and all pertinent circumstances reasonably necessary for him or her to make a determination on the exercise, disclaimer or lapse of the power at least one hundred*twenty days prior to the end of the period for making a disclaimer or the end of the period in which the power is valid under its terms, whichever first occurs. The foregoing exemption from liability shall not apply if the personal representative exercises or disclaims the power or allows the power to lapse in bad faith.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1765)\n\n*Word \"and\" appears here in original rolls.",

Grant a power of appointment to such trustee that did not exist in the first trust;\n\n(2) An exercise of the authority granted by subsection 1 of this section is subject to the following limitations:\n\n(a) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision, for a marital deduction for purposes of the gift or estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the trust instrument for the second trust, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying for the deduction, or would have reduced the amount of the deduction, under the same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code under which the transfer qualified;\n\n(b) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision, for a charitable deduction for purposes of the income, gift, or estate tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the trust instrument for the second trust, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying for the deduction, or would have reduced the amount of the deduction, under the same provisions of the Internal Revenue Code under which the transfer qualified;\n\n(c) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in Section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the trust instrument for the second trust, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying under Section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in Section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, by application of Section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit a term that, if included or omitted from the trust instrument for the second trust, would have prevented the transfer from meeting the requirements of Section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(d) If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation, as defined in Section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision would be, a permitted shareholder under any provision of Section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code, the trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority with respect to part or all of the S corporation stock only if the second trust receiving the stock is a permitted shareholder under Section 1361(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision would be, a qualified subchapter-S trust within the meaning of Section 1361(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit a term that prevents the second trust from qualifying as a qualified subchapter-S trust; and\n\n(e) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this section other than this subdivision, for a zero inclusion ratio for purpose of the generation-skipping transfer tax under Section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the trust instrument for the second trust shall not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first trust, would have prevented the transfer to the first trust from qualifying for a zero inclusion ratio under Section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(3) The exercise of such authority does not apply to trust property subject to a presently exercisable power of withdrawal held by a trust beneficiary to whom, or for the benefit of whom, the trustee has authority to make distributions, unless after the exercise of such authority, such beneficiary's power of withdrawal is unchanged with respect to the trust property; and\n\n(4) A spendthrift clause or a provision in the trust instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust shall not preclude the trustee from exercising the authority granted by subsection 1 of this section.\n\n5. At least sixty days prior to making a discretionary distribution under subsection 1 of this section, the trustee of the first trust shall notify the permissible distributees of the first trust and the permissible distributees of the second trust of the distribution. A beneficiary may waive the right to the notice required by this subsection and, with respect to future distributions, may withdraw a waiver previously given.\n\n6. In exercising the authority granted by subsection 1 of this section, the trustee shall remain subject to all fiduciary duties otherwise imposed under the trust instrument and Missouri law.\n\n7. This section does not impose on a trustee a duty to exercise the authority granted by subsection 1 of this section in favor of another trust or to consider exercising such authority in favor of another trust.\n\n8. A second trust may have a duration that is the same as or different from the duration of the first trust. However, to the extent that property of the second trust is attributable to property of the first trust, the property of the second trust is subject to any rules governing maximum perpetuity, accumulation, or suspension of the power of alienation which apply to property of the first trust. The provisions of this subsection shall not preclude the creation of a general power of appointment in the trust instrument for a second trust as authorized by subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of this section.\n\n9. In the event the trust instrument for the second trust in part does not comply with this section but would otherwise be effective under this section, the exercise of the power is effective and the following rules apply with respect to the principal of the second trust attributable to the exercise of the power:\n\n(1) A provision in the trust instrument for the second trust which is not permitted under this section is void to the extent necessary to comply with this section; and\n\n(2) A provision required by this section to be in the trust instrument for the second trust which is not contained in the trust instrument is deemed to be included in the trust instrument to the extent necessary to comply with this section.\n\n10. This section is intended to codify and, from and after enactment, to provide certain limitations to the common law of this state, and this section applies to any trust governed by the laws of this state, including a trust whose principal place of administration is transferred to this state before or after the enactment of this section.\n\n(L. 2011 S.B. 59, A.L. 2022 S.B. 886)",

Distribution of trust income or principal to qualified remainder beneficiary, when — applicability to irrevocable trust, when. —1. During any period of time that this section applies to an irrevocable trust, the trustee shall have the authority in its discretion to distribute trust income or principal to a qualified remainder beneficiary of the trust. For purposes of this section, a\"qualified remainder beneficiary\"is a descendant of a permissible distributee who will be eligible to receive distributions of trust income or principal, whether mandatory or discretionary, upon the termination of the interest of such permissible distributee or upon the termination of the trust.\n\n2. This section shall apply to an irrevocable trust that is administered in this state if:\n\n(1) The trustee may distribute trust income or principal to one or more permissible distributees;\n\n(2) No distributions of trust income or principal have been made to any permissible distributee during the ten-year period preceding the notice required by subsection 5 of this section;\n\n(3) The trustee determines that there will be sufficient assets in the trust for the trustee to meet its obligations to the permissible distributees after any distributions authorized by this section;\n\n(4) The trustee determines that the application of this section to the trust is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust;\n\n(5) The trustee determines that the application of this section to a trust that is exempt from the federal generation-skipping transfer tax will not cause the trust to become subject to such tax; and\n\n(6) The trust became irrevocable on or before September 25, 1985.\n\n3. After the trustee determines that this section applies to a trust, this section shall continue to apply to the trust until the first to occur of the following:\n\n(1) The termination of the interests of all the beneficiaries who were permissible distributees on the date of the notice required by subsection 5 of this section;\n\n(2) The termination of the trust; or\n\n(3) The trustee determines that additional distributions under this section will impair the ability of the trustee to meet its obligation to the permissible distributees.\n\n4.

If a trust instrument containing a no-contest clause is or has become irrevocable, an interested person may file a petition to the court for an interlocutory determination whether a particular motion, petition, or other claim for relief by the interested person would trigger application of the no-contest clause or would otherwise trigger a forfeiture that is enforceable under applicable law and public policy.\n\n2. The petition described in subsection 1 of this section shall be verified under oath. The petition may be filed by an interested person either as a separate judicial proceeding, or brought with other claims for relief in a single judicial proceeding, all in the manner prescribed generally for such proceedings under this chapter. If a petition is joined with other claims for relief, the court shall enter its order or judgment on the petition before proceeding any further with any other claim for relief joined therein. In ruling on such a petition, the court shall consider the text of the clause, the context to the terms of the trust instrument as a whole, and in the context of the verified factual allegations in the petition. No evidence beyond the pleadings and the trust instrument shall be taken except as required to resolve an ambiguity in the no-contest clause.\n\n3. An order or judgment determining a petition described in subsection 1 of this section shall have the effect set forth in subsections 4 and 5 of this section, and shall be subject to appeal as with other final judgments. If the order disposes of fewer than all claims for relief in a judicial proceeding, that order is subject to interlocutory appeal in accordance with the applicable rules for taking such an appeal. If an interlocutory appeal is taken, the court may stay the pending judicial proceeding until final disposition of said appeal on such terms and conditions as the court deems reasonable and proper under the circumstances. A final ruling on the applicability of a no-contest clause shall not preclude any later filing and adjudication of other claims related to the trust.\n\n4. An order or judgment, in whole or in part, on a petition described in subsection 1 of this section shall result in the no-contest clause being enforceable to the extent of the court's ruling, and shall govern application of the no-contest clause to the extent that the interested person then proceeds forward with the claims described therein. In the event such an interlocutory order or judgment is vacated, reversed, or otherwise modified on appeal, no interested person shall be prejudiced by any reliance, through action, inaction, or otherwise, on the order or judgment prior to final disposition of the appeal.\n\n5. An order or judgment shall have effect only as to the specific trust terms and factual basis recited in the petition. If claims are later filed that are materially different than those upon which the order or judgment is based, then to the extent such new claims are raised, the party in whose favor the order or judgment was entered shall have no protection from enforcement of the no-contest clause otherwise afforded by the order and judgment entered under this section.\n\n6. For purposes of this section, a\"no-contest clause\"shall mean a provision in a trust instrument purporting to rescind a donative transfer to, or a fiduciary appointment of, any person, or that otherwise effects a forfeiture of some or all of an interested person's beneficial interest in a trust estate as a result of some action taken by the beneficiary. This definition shall not be construed in any way as determining whether a no-contest clause is enforceable under applicable law and public policy in a particular factual situation. As used in this section, the term \"no-contest clause\" shall also mean an \"in terrorem clause\".\n\n7. A no-contest clause is not enforceable against an interested person in, but not limited to, the following circumstances:\n\n(1) Filing a motion, petition, or other claim for relief objecting to the jurisdiction or venue of the court over a proceeding concerning a trust, or over any person joined, or attempted to be joined, in such a proceeding;\n\n(2) Filing a motion, petition, or other claim for relief concerning an accounting, report, or notice that has or should have been made by a trustee, provided the interested person otherwise has standing to do so under applicable law, including, but not limited to, section 456.6-603;\n\n(3) Filing a motion, petition, or other claim for relief under chapter 475 concerning the appointment of a guardian or conservator for the settlor;\n\n(4) Filing a motion, petition, or other claim for relief under chapter 404 concerning the settlor;\n\n(5) Disclosure to any person of information concerning a trust instrument or that is relevant to a proceeding before the court concerning the trust instrument or property of the trust estate, unless such disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law;\n\n(6) Filing a motion, pleading, or other claim for relief seeking approval of a nonjudicial settlement agreement concerning a trust instrument, as set forth in section 456.1-111;\n\n(7) To the extent a petition under subsection 1 of this section is limited to the procedure and purpose described therein.\n\n8. In any proceeding brought under this section, the court may award costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees to any party, as provided in section 456.10-1004.\n\n(L. 2014 H.B. 1231 merged with S.B. 500 merged with S.B. 621)",

With respect to an irrevocable trust without a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.\n\n3. With respect to an irrevocable trust with a spendthrift provision, a spendthrift provision will prevent the settlor's creditors from satisfying claims from the trust assets except:\n\n(1) Where the conveyance of assets to the trust was fraudulent as to creditors pursuant to the provisions of chapter 428; or\n\n(2) To the extent of the settlor's beneficial interest in the trust assets, if at the time the trust became irrevocable:\n\n(a) The settlor was the sole beneficiary of either the income or principal of the trust or retained the power to amend the trust; or\n\n(b) The settlor was one of a class of beneficiaries and retained a right to receive a specific portion of the income or principal of the trust that was determinable solely from the provisions of the trust instrument.\n\n4.

While a trust is revocable, the trustee may follow a direction of the settlor that is contrary to the terms of the trust.\n\n2. A trust instrument may provide for one or more persons, not then serving as a trustee and not the settlor or a beneficiary, to be given any powers over the trust as expressly granted in the trust instrument. Any such person may be identified and appointed as a trust protector or similar term. Whenever a trust instrument names, appoints, authorizes, or otherwise designates a trust protector, the trust shall be deemed a directed trust.\n\n3. A trust protector appointed in the trust instrument shall have only the powers granted to the trust protector by the express terms of the trust instrument, and a trust protector is only authorized to act within the scope of the authority expressly granted in the trust instrument. Without limiting the authority of the settlor to grant powers to a trust protector, the express powers that may be granted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Remove and appoint a trustee or a trust protector or name a successor trustee or trust protector;\n\n(2) Modify or amend the trust instrument to:\n\n(a) Achieve favorable tax status or respond to changes in the Internal Revenue Code or state law, or the rulings and regulations under such code or law;\n\n(b) Reflect legal changes that affect trust administration;\n\n(c) Correct errors or ambiguities that might otherwise require court construction; or\n\n(d) Correct a drafting error that defeats a grantor's intent;\n\n(3) Increase, decrease, modify, or restrict the interests of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust;\n\n(4) Terminate the trust in favor of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust;\n\n(5) Change the applicable law governing the trust and the trust situs; or\n\n(6) Such other powers as are expressly granted to the trust protector in the trust instrument.\n\n4. Notwithstanding any provision in the trust instrument to the contrary, a trust protector shall have no power to modify a trust to:\n\n(1) Remove a requirement from a trust created to meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p(d)(4) to pay back a governmental entity for benefits provided to the permissible beneficiary of the trust at the death of that beneficiary; or\n\n(2) Reduce or eliminate an income interest of the income beneficiary of any of the following types of trusts:\n\n(a) A trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under Section 2056 or 2523 of the Internal Revenue Code or for state tax purposes under any comparable provision of applicable state law, during the life of the settlor's spouse;\n\n(b) A charitable remainder trust under Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code, during the life of the noncharitable beneficiary;\n\n(c) A grantor retained annuity trust under Section 2702 of the Internal Revenue Code, during any period in which the settlor is a beneficiary; or\n\n(d) A trust for which an election as a qualified Sub-Chapter S Trust under Section 1361(d) of the Internal Revenue Code is currently in place.\n\n5. Except to the extent otherwise provided in a trust instrument specifically referring to this subsection, the trust protector shall not exercise a power in a way that would result in a taxable gift for federal gift tax purposes or cause the inclusion of any assets of the trust in the trust protector's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.\n\n6. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the trust instrument and in subsection 7 of this section, and notwithstanding any provision of sections 456.1-101 to 456.11-1106 to the contrary:\n\n(1) A trust protector shall act in a fiduciary capacity in carrying out the powers granted to the trust protector in the trust instrument, and shall have such duties to the beneficiaries, the settlor, or the trust as set forth in the trust instrument, provided that the trust instrument may provide that the trust protector shall act in a nonfiduciary capacity. A trust protector is not a trustee, and is not liable or accountable as a trustee when performing or declining to perform the express powers given to the trust protector in the trust instrument. A trust protector is not liable for the acts or omissions of any fiduciary or beneficiary under the trust instrument;\n\n(2) A trust protector is exonerated from any and all liability for the trust protector's acts or omissions, or arising from any exercise or nonexercise of the powers expressly conferred on the trust protector in the trust instrument, unless it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts or omissions of the trust protector were done or omitted in breach of the trust protector's duty, in bad faith or with reckless indifference;\n\n(3) A trust protector is authorized to exercise the express powers granted in the trust instrument at any time and from time to time after the trust protector acquires knowledge of their appointment as trust protector and of the powers granted. The trust protector may take any action, judicial or otherwise, necessary to carry out the duties given to the trust protector in the trust instrument;\n\n(4) A trust protector is entitled to receive, from the assets of the trust for which the trust protector is acting, reasonable compensation, and reimbursement of the reasonable costs and expenses incurred, in determining whether to carry out, and in carrying out, the express powers given to the trust protector in the trust instrument;\n\n(5) A trust protector is entitled to receive, from the assets of the trust for which the trust protector is acting, reimbursement of the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, of defending any claim made against the trust protector arising from the acts or omissions of the trust protector acting in that capacity unless it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the trust protector was acting in bad faith or with reckless indifference; and\n\n(6) The express powers granted in the trust instrument shall not be exercised by the trust protector for the trust protector's own personal benefit.\n\n7. If a trust protector is granted a power in the trust instrument to direct, consent to, or disapprove a trustee's actual or proposed investment decision, distribution decision, or other decision of the trustee required to be performed under applicable trust law in carrying out the duties of the trustee in administering the trust, then only with respect to such power, excluding the powers identified in subsection 3 of this section, the trust protector shall have the same duties and liabilities as if serving as a trustee under the trust instrument unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise. In carrying out any written directions given to the trustee by the trust protector concerning actual or proposed investment decisions, the trustee shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 469.900 to 469.913. For purposes of this subsection,\"investment decisions\"means, with respect to any investment, decisions to retain, purchase, sell, exchange, tender, or otherwise engage in transactions affecting the ownership of investments or rights therein and, with respect to nonpublicly traded investments, the valuation thereof.\n\n8. Any trustee of a directed trust shall not be accountable under the law or equity for any act or omission of a trust protector and shall stand absolved from liability for executing the decisions or instructions from a trust protector or for monitoring the actions or inactions of a trust protector. A trustee shall take reasonable steps to facilitate the activity of a trust protector in a directed trust. A trustee shall carry out the written directions given to the trustee by a trust protector acting within the scope of the powers expressly granted to the trust protector in the trust instrument. Except as otherwise provided in the trust instrument, the trustee shall not be liable for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from any act taken or omitted as a result of the written direction of the trust protector or the failure of the trust protector to provide consent. Except as otherwise provided in the trust instrument, the trustee shall have no duty to monitor the conduct of the trust protector, provide advice to or consult with the trust protector, or communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary concerning instances in which the trustee would or might have exercised the trustee's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust protector. Except as otherwise provided in the trust instrument, any actions taken by the trustee at the trust protector's direction shall be deemed to be administrative actions taken by the trustee solely to allow the trustee to carry out the instructions of the trust protector and shall not be deemed to constitute an act by the trustee to monitor the trust protector or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the trust protector's authority. Whenever a directed trust reserves to a person or vests in an advisory or investment committee authority to direct the making or retention of any investment, to the exclusion of the trustee or trustees, the excluded trustee or trustees shall not be liable, individually or as a trustee, for any loss resulting from the making or retention of any investment pursuant to such direction.\n\n9. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in the trust instrument, the trust protector shall be entitled to receive information regarding the administration of the trust as follows:\n\n(1) Upon the request of the trust protector, unless unreasonable under the circumstances, the trustee shall promptly provide to the trust protector any and all information related to the trust that may relate to the exercise or nonexercise of a power expressly granted to the trust protector in the trust instrument. The trustee has no obligation to provide any information to the trust protector except to the extent a trust protector requests information under this section;\n\n(2) The request of the trust protector for information under this section shall be with respect to a single trust that is sufficiently identified to enable the trustee to locate the records of the trust; and\n\n(3) If the trustee is bound by any confidentiality restrictions with respect to an asset of a trust, a trust protector who requests information under this section about such asset shall agree to be bound by the confidentiality restrictions that bind the trustee before receiving such information from the trustee.\n\n10. A trust protector may resign by giving thirty days' written notice to the trustee and any successor trust protector. A successor trust protector, if any, shall have all the powers expressly granted in the trust instrument to the resigning trust protector unless such powers are expressly modified for the successor trust protector.\n\n11. A trust protector of a trust having its principal place of administration in this state submits personally to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state during any period that the principal place of administration of the trust is located in this state and the trust protector is serving in such capacity. The trust instrument may also provide that a trust protector is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of this state as a condition of appointment.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 1511, A.L. 2012 S.B. 628, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1250)",
