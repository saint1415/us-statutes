The court may grant letters of standby guardianship to the person or, if the court deems it advisable, conduct a hearing to determine the propriety of the person having begun, and continuing, to act as standby guardian and the propriety of issuing letters of standby guardianship to the person.\n\n­­The person shall, within ten days after he or she begins to act as standby guardian, notify the court in writing of that fact and of the reasons therefor. The court may grant letters of standby guardianship to the person or, if the court deems it advisable, conduct a hearing to determine the propriety of the person having begun, and continuing, to act as standby guardian and the propriety of issuing letters of standby guardianship to the person.\n\n6. A person acting as standby guardian of a minor or incapacitated person shall, within sixty days after he or she begins to act, petition the court for appointment of the standby guardian or some other qualified person as guardian of the minor or incapacitated person. Proceedings on the petition shall be conducted in the same manner as would be applicable in a case for appointment of a successor guardian under section 475.115.\n\n7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to:\n\n(1) Deprive a parent of his or her legal rights with respect to a minor or incapacitated person who is a child of that parent, including court-ordered visitation with the child, nor to authorize a grant of authority to a standby guardian which would supersede any such rights; or\n\n(2) Relieve a parent of his or her legal obligations or duties to a minor or incapacitated person who is a child of that parent, including a duty to support the child in accordance with a court or administrative order.\n\n8. Except to the extent determined by the court to be inconsistent with the provisions of this section or as expressly provided in this section, the laws applicable to guardianship proceedings shall apply to all proceedings under this section.\n\n(L. 2009 H.B. 154)",

Appointment of guardian or conservator of disabled or incapacitated persons — order of priority. —1. Before appointing any other eligible person as guardian of an incapacitated person, or conservator of a disabled person, the court shall consider the suitability of appointing any of the following persons, listed in the order of priority, who appear to be willing to serve:\n\n(1) If the incapacitated or disabled person is, at the time of the hearing, able to make and communicate a reasonable choice, any eligible person nominated by the person;\n\n(2) Any eligible person nominated in a durable power of attorney executed by the incapacitated or disabled person, or in an instrument in writing signed by the incapacitated or disabled person and by two witnesses who signed at the incapacitated or disabled person's request, before the inception of the person's incapacity or disability;\n\n(3) The spouse, parents, adult children, adult brothers and sisters and other close adult relatives of the incapacitated or disabled person;\n\n(4) Any other eligible person or, with respect to the estate only, any eligible organization or corporation, nominated in a duly probated will of such a spouse or relative.\n\n2. The court shall not appoint an unrelated third party as a guardian or conservator unless there is no relative suitable and willing to serve or if the appointment of a relative or nominee is otherwise contrary to the best interests of the incapacitated or disabled person. If the incapacitated or disabled person is a minor under the care of the children's division and is entering adult guardianship or conservatorship, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that he or she has no relative suitable and willing to serve as guardian or conservator.\n\n3. Except for good cause shown, the court shall make its appointment in accordance with the incapacitated or disabled person's most recent valid nomination of an eligible person qualified to serve as guardian of the person or conservator of the estate.\n\n4. Except for those individuals specified in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall require all guardians and conservators who are seeking appointment and who have a fiduciary responsibility to a ward, an incapacitated person, or a disabled person to submit at their own expense to a background screening that shall include the disqualification lists of the departments of mental health, social services, and health and senior services; the abuse and neglect registries for adults and children; a Missouri criminal record review; and the sexual offender registry. Individuals seeking appointment as a conservator shall also submit, at their own expense, to a credit history investigation. The nominated guardian or conservator shall file the results of the reports with the court at least ten days prior to the appointment hearing date unless waived or modified by the court for good cause shown by an affidavit filed simultaneously with the petition for appointment or in the event the protected person requests an expedited hearing. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to:\n\n(1) Public administrators; or\n\n(2) The ward's, incapacitated person's, or disabled person's spouse, parents, children who have reached eighteen years of age, or siblings who have reached eighteen years of age.\n\n5. Guardians certified by a national accrediting organization may file proof of certification in lieu of the requirements of subsections 4 and 6 of this section.\n\n6. An order appointing a guardian or conservator shall not be signed by the judge until such reports have been filed with the court and reviewed by the judge, who shall consider the reports in determining whether to appoint a guardian or conservator. Such reports, or lack thereof, shall be certified either by an affidavit or by obtaining a certified copy of the reports. No reports or national criminal history record check shall be required by the court upon the application of a petitioner for an emergency temporary guardianship or emergency temporary conservatorship.

Except as herein otherwise provided:\n\n(1) Any adult person may be appointed guardian of the person or conservator of the estate, or both, of a minor or incapacitated or disabled person, except that a parent shall not be denied appointment as guardian of the person of a minor for the reason that the parent is a minor;\n\n(2) Any charitable organization organized and incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation under the laws of this state prior to January 1, 1902, shall be qualified to continue to serve as guardian of the person of any ward for whom such charitable organization has been appointed guardian of the person prior to September 28, 1983, or to be appointed guardian of the person or persons adjudicated incapacitated subsequent to September 28, 1983;\n\n(3) Any social service agency located within a county of the first classification or within a city not within a county except any county of the first classification without a charter form of government with a population of one hundred thousand or more inhabitants which contains all or part of a city with a population of three hundred fifty thousand or more inhabitants, which is found capable by the court of providing an active and suitable program of guardianship for the incapacitated person, taking into consideration the nature of such person's disability and the nature of such organization's services, may be appointed as guardian of the person; however, no social service agency shall be appointed as guardian of the person under this subdivision unless it employs a licensed professional found by the court to have sufficient expertise to meet the needs of the ward, and it is found by the court that such professional shall have primary responsibility for providing guardianship services to the incapacitated person for which such social service agency is appointed guardian. The court shall not appoint as guardian of the person under this subdivision a social service agency which is providing residential services to the ward;\n\n(4) Any corporation authorized to do business in this state and empowered by its charter so to act or any national banking association authorized so to act in this state may be appointed conservator of the estate of a minor or disabled person. No corporation other than a social service agency may be appointed to serve as guardian of the incapacitated person.\n\n2. No person or corporation, other than the public administrator of the county, shall be appointed guardian or conservator unless the appointee has filed a consent to act. Except as otherwise provided by this section, no person or corporation licensed as a facility by the Missouri department of mental health or the Missouri department of social services, nor any administrator, owner, operator, manager or employee of such a facility shall be appointed guardian of the person or conservator of the estate of any resident of that facility, unless related within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity to the resident. No full-time judge of any court of this state and no clerk, deputy clerk or division clerk shall be appointed as guardian of the person or conservator of the estate, but a judge, clerk, deputy clerk or division clerk may serve as a guardian or conservator for a ward or protectee who is a spouse or is within the third degree of relationship by consanguinity or affinity as calculated according to civil law. No natural person under eighteen years of age, other than as provided in subsection 1 of this section, no incapacitated or disabled person, and no habitual drunkard shall be appointed guardian of the person or conservator of the estate. No person whose letters of guardianship or conservatorship are revoked shall be appointed guardian or conservator within two years after the revocation. No one shall be appointed guardian of the person or conservator of the estate unless qualified to perform the duties of said office or offices.\n\n3. A person becomes a guardian or conservator of a minor or incapacitated or disabled person upon issuance of letters of guardianship or conservatorship by the court. A person so appointed need not reside within this state in order to accept or serve as guardian or conservator, unless the court finds that such person, taking into consideration his place of residence, is unable to effectively perform the duties of guardian or conservator as provided by this code. The guardianship or conservatorship status continues until terminated, without regard to the location from time to time, whether within or outside of this state, of the guardian and ward or conservator and protectee.\n\n4. Subsections 3 and 4 of section 473.117, section 473.689, and section 475.338 are applicable to nonresident guardians and conservators.\n\n5. If a social service agency is appointed to act as guardian under this section, any other eligible person listed in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 475.050 may petition the court to have the social service agency removed as guardian. The court shall grant the petition if it finds that the petitioner is qualified and will act in the best interests of the disabled or incapacitated person. The removal of a social service agency under such circumstances does not require evidence that the agency committed acts of misfeasance warranting the agency's removal pursuant to section 475.110.\n\n6. A social service agency acting as a guardian pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section may only authorize the withholding or withdrawal of artificially provided nutrition or hydration as prescribed under section 404.820.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 385 § 292, A.L. 1957 p. 829, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1979 H.B. 95, A.L. 1983 S.B. 44 & 45, A.L. 1987 H.B. 637, A.L. 1994 S.B. 734)\n\n(1977) Held, a relative is entitled to preference over a stranger as guardian unless the record discloses dissension in the family, adverse interest of the relative and the incompetent, lack of business ability of the relative or any other reason a stranger would best serve the interest of the incompetent.

The court shall allow a reasonable attorney's fee for the services rendered, to be taxed as costs of the proceeding. Upon entry of appearance by private counsel on behalf of the respondent, the court may permit the court-appointed attorney to withdraw only if after a hearing the court finds cause to permit the withdrawal. The private counsel shall meet the requirements of the court-appointed attorney in representing the respondent as provided in subsection 4 of this section. The respondent's attorney shall not also serve as guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem for the respondent unless and until a judgment granting guardianship, conservatorship, limited guardianship, or limited conservatorship has been entered by the court. If the attorney for the respondent has filed or intends to file an appeal of such judgment, the attorney for the respondent shall not serve as guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem for the respondent until all proceedings in connection with such appeal have been finally resolved. The petitioner shall not nominate an attorney for the respondent.\n\n6. The court may direct that the respondent be examined by a physician, licensed psychologist, or other appropriate professional if the other professional has experience or training in the alleged mental, physical, or cognitive impairment. The court-appointed physician, licensed psychologist, or other professional shall, prior to examination, explain to the respondent in simple language, the following:\n\n(1) That the purpose of the examination is to produce evidence which may be used to determine whether the respondent is incapacitated, disabled, partially incapacitated, or partially disabled;\n\n(2) That respondent has the right to remain silent;\n\n(3) That anything respondent says may be used at the court hearing, and in making the determination of incapacity or disability.\n\n7. The court-appointed physician, licensed psychologist, or other professional shall submit a report in writing to the court and to counsel for all parties. It shall not be a valid objection to the review of the report by the court or the attorneys for the parties that the court will be responsible for the ultimate determination of incapacity or partial incapacity. If other objections to the report are made by any party, the court may order a hearing for the limited purpose of determining whether the court shall admit the report. The court may allow a reasonable fee for the services rendered by the physician, licensed psychologist, or other professional to be taxed as costs in the proceeding.\n\n8. If prima facie proof of partial or complete incapacity or disability, with or without the court-ordered evaluation as provided in subsections 6 and 7 of this section, is made upon motion by any party or the court on its own motion, a physician, licensed psychologist, or other appropriate professional is competent and may be compelled by the court to testify as to information acquired from the respondent, despite otherwise applicable testimonial privileges. Evidence received under this subsection that would otherwise be privileged and confidential may not be used in any other civil action or criminal proceeding without the consent of the holder of the privilege. Any resulting report shall be shared with the respondent and counsel for all parties but shall not be used in any other civil action or criminal proceeding without the consent of the holder of the privilege.\n\n9. The petitioner has the burden of proving incapacity, partial incapacity, disability, or partial disability by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n10. The respondent shall have the following rights in addition to those elsewhere specified and shall be advised of these rights by the attorney for the respondent:\n\n(1) The right to be represented by an attorney;\n\n(2) The right to have a jury trial;\n\n(3) The right to present evidence in the respondent's behalf;\n\n(4) The right to cross-examine witnesses who testify against the respondent;\n\n(5) The right to remain silent;\n\n(6) The right to have the hearing opened or closed to the public as the respondent elects;\n\n(7) The right to a hearing conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence in civil proceedings, except as modified by this chapter;\n\n(8) The right to be present at the hearing;\n\n(9) The right to appeal the court's decision.\n\n11. If the court finds that the respondent possesses capacity to manage the respondent's essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety, and other care or that the respondent possesses the ability to manage the respondent's financial resources, the court shall deny the petition. On the other hand, if the court finds that the capacity of the respondent to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent as to render the respondent incapable of managing some or all of the respondent's essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety or other care so that serious physical injury, illness, or disease is likely to occur, or that the capacity of the respondent to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent so as to render the respondent unable to manage some or all of the respondent's financial resources, the court shall appoint a guardian or limited guardian, a conservator or limited conservator, or both in combination.\n\n12. If the court finds the respondent to be in some degree incapacitated or disabled, or both, the court, in determining the degree of supervision necessary, shall apply the least restrictive alternative principle as defined in this chapter and shall not restrict the respondent's personal liberty or the respondent's freedom to manage the respondent's financial resources to any greater extent than is necessary to protect the respondent's person and the respondent's financial resources. The limitations imposed upon the authority of the guardian or conservator as set forth in the findings of the court shall be stated in the letters of the guardian or conservator and shall be set forth in the notice of first publication of letters of conservatorship granted.\n\n13. Before appointing a guardian or conservator, the court shall consider whether the respondent's needs may be met without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian or conservator, or both, by a less restrictive alternative including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Evidence that the respondent has appointed an attorney-in-fact in a durable power of attorney executed by the respondent before the petition was filed;\n\n(2) The management of the beneficial interests of the respondent in a trust by a trustee;\n\n(3) Evidence that a representative payee has been appointed to manage the respondent's public benefits;\n\n(4) Supported decision-making agreements or the provision of protective or supportive services or arrangements provided by individuals or public or private services or agencies;\n\n(5) The use of appropriate services or assistive technology;\n\n(6) The appointment of a temporary emergency guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem under subsection 15 of this section; or\n\n(7) The appointment of a limited guardian or conservator.\n\n14. The court shall make and recite in its order detailed findings of fact stating:\n\n(1) The extent of the respondent's physical, mental, and cognitive incapacity to manage essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety, or other care;\n\n(2) The extent of the respondent's physical, mental, and cognitive incapacity to manage the respondent's financial resources;\n\n(3) Whether the respondent requires placement in a supervised living situation and, if so, the degree of supervision needed;\n\n(4) Whether the respondent's financial resources require supervision and, if so, the nature and extent of supervision needed;\n\n(5) Whether the respondent retains the right to vote;\n\n(6) Whether the respondent is permitted to drive a motor vehicle if the respondent can pass the required driving test; and\n\n(7) Whether the respondent retains the right to marry.\n\n15. If it is alleged in a petition that an alleged incapacitated or disabled respondent has no guardian or conservator and an emergency exists that presents a substantial risk that serious physical harm will occur to the respondent's person or irreparable damage will occur to the respondent's property because of the respondent's failure or inability to provide for the respondent's essential human needs or to protect the respondent's property, the court may, with notice to such person's attorney, as provided in subsection 4 of this section, and service of notice upon such person as provided in subsection 2 of this section, and, with or without notice to other persons interested in the proceeding, after hearing, appoint an emergency guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem for a specified period not to exceed ninety days and for specified purposes. Except for good cause shown, the court shall hold a hearing on petitions filed under this section within five business days of the filing of the petition. Orders appointing the guardian or conservator ad litem may be modified upon motion and hearing. Only after a hearing and a showing of continuing emergency need, the court may order the extension of the appointment of an emergency guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem from time to time, not to exceed ninety days each. A guardian ad litem or conservator ad litem may be removed at any time and shall make any report the court requires. Proceedings under this subsection shall not be employed as alternative to proceedings for the involuntary detention and treatment of a mentally ill person under the provisions of chapter 632. If no petition for guardianship, conservatorship, limited guardianship, or limited conservatorship has been filed within the first ninety days following the granting of emergency authority under this section, the court may terminate the authority granted under the emergency letters upon motion of the attorney for the respondent and a finding that doing so would not be manifestly contrary to the respondent's interest.\n\n(RSMo 1939 §§ 447, 449, A.L. 1955 p. 385 § 297, A.L. 1983 S.B. 44 & 45, A.L. 1985 S.B. 35, et al., A.L. 2018 S.B. 806)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 §§ 448, 450; 1919 §§ 444, 446; 1909 §§ 474, 476\n\n(1986) Waiver of rights under this section must be affirmative and on the record.

If a person has disappeared and cannot be located or has been forcibly detained either illegally or by a foreign government or is absent by reason of being physically located in a country other than the United States and is unable to return to the United States because of physical or mental condition, for a period of one month or more, and such disappearance, detention, or physical location makes it impossible for that person, or any person legally acting on his behalf, to manage his financial resources as defined in section 475.010, any person may file a petition in the probate division of the circuit court of proper venue for appointment of himself or some other qualified person as limited conservator for the disappeared, detained, or absent person.

Review of status of persons under guardianship or conservatorship — required report, content. —1. At least annually, the court shall inquire into the status of every adult ward and protectee under its jurisdiction for the purpose of determining whether the incapacity or disability may have ceased or changed and to insure that the guardian or conservator is discharging the guardian's or conservator's responsibilities and duties in accordance with this chapter.\n\n2. In order to implement the court review prescribed by this section, the guardian or limited guardian shall file annually on the anniversary date of the guardian's or limited guardian's letters a report concerning the personal status of the adult ward and plans by the guardian or limited guardian for future care. Such report may be combined with the settlement of accounts if the guardian is also conservator of the estate of the ward. The report shall be in the form prescribed by the court and shall include the following information:\n\n(1) The present address of the ward;\n\n(2) The present address of the guardian;\n\n(3) Unless the report specifies that the ward is living with the guardian, the number of times the guardian has had contact with the ward, and the nature of such contacts including the date the ward was last seen by the guardian;\n\n(4) A summary of the guardian's visits with the ward and activities on the ward's behalf and the extent to which the ward has participated in decisionmaking;\n\n(5) If the ward is institutionalized, whether the guardian has received a copy of the treatment or habilitation plan and, if so, the date of such plan, and whether the guardian agrees with its provision;\n\n(6) The date the ward was last seen by a physician or other professional and the purpose;\n\n(7) The current mental and physical condition of the ward and any major changes in the ward's condition since the last report;\n\n(8) The opinion of the guardian as to the need for the continuation of the guardianship and whether it is necessary to increase or decrease the powers of the guardian; and\n\n(9) A summarized plan for the coming year. If an individual support plan, treatment plan, or plan of care is in place, such plan may be submitted in lieu of the requirements of this subdivision.\n\n3. The court may as part of its review, in its discretion, order the performance of a mental status evaluation of the ward and may require any hospital, physician, or custodial facility to submit copies of their records relating to the treatment, habilitation, or care of the ward. The court, as part of its review and in its discretion, may also contact the department of health and senior services or other appropriate agencies to investigate the conduct of the guardian and report its findings to the court.\n\n4. If there is an indication that the incapacity or disability of the ward or protectee has ceased, the court shall appoint an attorney to file on behalf of the ward or protectee a petition for termination of the guardianship or conservatorship or for restoration.\n\n5.

In the event that such a hearing is ordered and the ward or protectee is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the ward or protectee in the proceedings. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that the guardian or conservator is not discharging his or her duties and responsibilities as required by this code or is not acting in the best interests of the ward or protectee, the court shall enter such orders as it deems appropriate under the circumstances.

The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 475.075.

If it is established in a proceeding conducted in a manner similar to a proceeding for the appointment of a conservator of the estate that a person is a minor or disabled, or has a physical or mental disability as defined under state or federal law, the court, without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct or ratify any transaction necessary or desirable to achieve any security, service, or care arrangement meeting the foreseeable needs of the person.\n\n2.

A transaction pursuant to this section may include the establishment by the court or other grantor of an inter vivos trust, including a trust that complies with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p(d)(4), on behalf of the person provided that upon such person's death, after the payment of trustees' fees, any payments to the state Medicaid agency that are required by the provisions of 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p(d)(4) are made and, provided further, that any creditor of the person other than the state of Missouri shall also be paid all sums due for such person's care, maintenance and support, to the extent trust property is sufficient therefor, and, provided, such trust shall terminate upon such person's death and any amounts remaining in the trust after the foregoing payments shall be distributed to the remainder beneficiaries designated in the trust or as designated pursuant to the exercise of a power of appointment set forth in the trust. This section shall not be interpreted to require all such trusts to be established by a court proceeding.\n\n3. Before approving a protective arrangement or other transaction pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the interests of creditors and dependents of the person and, in view of such person's disability, whether such person needs the continuing protection of a conservator. The court may appoint a special conservator to assist in the accomplishment of any protective arrangement or other transaction authorized pursuant to this section who shall have the authority conferred by the order and serve until discharged by order after report to the court of all matters done pursuant to the order of appointment.\n\n4.

Any such trust which is in existence as of August 28, 1999, shall be subject to subsection 2 of this section, as amended, notwithstanding any provisions of such trust to the contrary.

The court may make orders for the management of the estate of the protectee for the care, education, treatment, habilitation, respite, support and maintenance of the protectee and for the support and maintenance of the protectee's family and education of the protectee's spouse and children, according to the protectee's means and obligation, if any, out of the proceeds of the protectee's estate, and may direct that payments for such purposes shall be made weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. The payments ordered under this section may be decreased or increased from time to time as ordered by the court.\n\n2. In setting the amount of the support allowance for the protectee or any other persons entitled to such support, the court shall consider the previous standard of living of the spouse or other family members, the composition of the estate, the income and other assets available to the protectee and the other persons, and the expenses of the protectee or the other persons entitled to support.\n\n3. Appropriations for any such purposes, expenses of administration and allowed claims shall be paid from the property or income of the estate. The court may authorize the conservator to borrow money and obligate the estate for the payment thereof if the court finds that funds of the estate for the payment of such obligation will be available within a reasonable time and that the loan is necessary. If payments are made to another under the order of the court, the conservator of the estate is not bound to see to the application thereof.\n\n4. In acting under this section the court shall take into account any duty imposed by law or contract upon a parent or spouse of the protectee, a government agency, a trustee, or other person or corporation, to make payments for the benefit of or provide support, education, care, treatment, habilitation, respite, maintenance or safekeeping of the protectee and the protectee's dependents.

The conservator of the estate of a minor or disabled person shall, under supervision of the court, protect, preserve, and manage the estate, apply it as provided in this code, account for it faithfully, perform all other duties required of the conservator by law, and at the termination of the conservatorship deliver the assets of the protectee to the persons entitled thereto. In protecting, preserving, and managing the estate, the conservator of the estate is under a duty to use the degree of care, skill, and prudence that an ordinarily prudent person uses in managing the property of, and conducting transactions on behalf of, others. If a conservator of the estate has special skills or is appointed on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, the conservator is under a duty to use those skills in the conduct of the protectee's affairs. A conservator of the estate is under a duty to act in the interest of the protectee and to avoid conflicts of interest which impair the conservator's ability so to act.\n\n2. The conservator of the estate shall take possession of all of the protectee's real and personal property, and of rents, income, issue, and profits therefrom, whether accruing before or after the conservator's appointment, and of the proceeds arising from the sale, mortgage, lease, or exchange thereof. Subject to such possession, the title to all such estate, and to the increment and proceeds thereof, is in the protectee and not in the conservator. Upon a showing that funds available or payable for the benefit of the protectee by any federal agency are being applied for the benefit of the protectee, or that such federal agency has refused to recognize the authority of the conservator to administer such funds, the court may waive, by order, the duty of the conservator to account therefor.\n\n3. In managing, investing, and distributing the estate of a protectee, the conservator shall use reasonable efforts to:\n\n(1) Ascertain the income, assets, and liabilities of the protectee;\n\n(2) Ascertain the needs and preferences of the protectee;\n\n(3) Coordinate with the guardian and consult with others close to the protectee;\n\n(4) Prepare a plan for the management of the protectee's income and assets; and\n\n(5) Provide oversight to any income and assets of the protectee under the control of the protectee.\n\n4. The court has full authority under the rules of civil procedure to enjoin any person from interfering with the right of the conservator to possession of the assets of the protectee, including benefits payable from any source.\n\n5. The conservator of the estate shall prosecute and defend all actions instituted in behalf of or against the protectee, collect all debts due or becoming due to the protectee, and give acquittances and discharges therefor, and adjust, settle, and pay all claims due or becoming due from the protectee so far as the protectee's estate and effects will extend, except as provided in sections 507.150 and 507.188.\n\n6. A conservator of the estate has power, without authorization or approval of the court, to:\n\n(1) Settle or compromise a claim against the protectee or the estate agreeing to pay or paying not more than five thousand dollars;\n\n(2) Settle, abandon, or compromise a claim in favor of the estate that does not exceed five thousand dollars;\n\n(3) Receive additions to the estate;\n\n(4) Sell, or agree to sell, chattels and choses in action reasonably worth not more than five thousand dollars for cash or upon terms involving a reasonable extension of credit;\n\n(5) Exchange, or agree to exchange, chattels and choses in action for other such property of equivalent value, not in excess of five thousand dollars;\n\n(6) Insure or contract for insurance of property of the estate against fire, theft and other hazards;\n\n(7) Insure or contract for insurance protecting the protectee against any liability likely to be incurred, including medical and hospital expenses, and protecting the conservator against liability to third parties arising from acts or omissions connected with possession or management of the estate;\n\n(8) Contract for needed repairs and maintenance of property of the estate;\n\n(9) Lease land and buildings for terms not exceeding one year, reserving reasonable rent, and renew any such lease for a like term;\n\n(10) Vote corporate stock in person or by general or limited proxy;\n\n(11) Contract for the provision of board, lodging, education, medical care, or necessaries of the protectee for periods not exceeding one year, and renew any such contract for a like period;\n\n(12) Deposit funds in a bank;\n\n(13) Pay taxes, assessments, and other expenses incurred in the collection, care, administration, and protection of the estate;\n\n(14) Prosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of estate assets;\n\n(15) Execute and deliver all instruments that will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the conservator; and\n\n(16) On or after August 28, 2009, invest the estate in accordance with the provisions of section 475.190.\n\n7. If, in exercising any power conferred by subsection 6 of this section, a conservator breaches any of the duties enumerated in subsection 1 of this section, the conservator may be surcharged for losses to the estate caused by the breach but persons who dealt with the conservator in good faith, without knowledge of or reason to suspect the breach of duty, may enforce and retain the benefits of any transaction with the conservator which the conservator has power under subsection 6 of this section to conduct.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 470, A.L. 1955 p. 385 § 308, A.L. 1959 H.B. 537, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1983 S.B. 44 & 45, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1571, A.L. 2006 S.B. 892, A.L. 2009 H.B. 239, A.L. 2018 S.B. 806)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 471; 1919 § 467; 1909 § 497\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nMultinational banks, securities and obligations of, investment in, when, 409.950",

The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise.

Whenever, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment of a person alleged to be of unsound mind or otherwise in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment to a hospital for mental disease or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States government, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans Administration or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit such person to said Veterans Administration or other agency. The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner as provided by the law of this state; and nothing in sections 475.380 to 475.480 shall affect his right to appear and be heard in the proceedings. Upon commitment, such person, when admitted to any facility operated by any such agency within or without this state shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans Administration or other agency. The chief officer of any facility of the Veterans Administration or institution operated by any other agency of the United States to which the person is so committed shall with respect to such person be vested with the same powers as superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole or discharge. Jurisdiction is retained in the committing or other appropriate court of this state at any time to inquire into the mental condition of the person so committed, and to determine the necessity for continuance of his restraint, and all commitments pursuant to sections 475.380 to 475.480 are so conditioned.\n\n2. The judgment or orders of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia, committing a person to the Veterans Administration, or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order; and the courts of the committing state, or of the District of Columbia, shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so committed for the purpose of inquiring into the mental condition of such person, and of determining the necessity for continuance of his restraint as is provided in subsection 1 of this section with respect to persons committed by the courts of this state. Consent is hereby given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the Veterans Administration, or of any institution operated in this state by any other agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole or discharge the committed person.\n\n3. Upon receipt of a certificate of the Veterans Administration or such other agency of the United States that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person heretofore committed to any hospital for the insane or other institution for the care or treatment of persons similarly afflicted and that such person is eligible for care or treatment, the superintendent of the institution may cause the transfer of such person to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the committing court or proper officer thereof shall be notified thereof by the transferring agency. No person shall be transferred to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States if he be confined pursuant to conviction of any felony or misdemeanor or if he has been acquitted of the charge solely on the ground of insanity, unless prior to transfer the court or other authority originally committing such person shall enter an order for such transfer after appropriate motion and hearing.\n\n4.

A delegation of powers under this section shall not be construed to change or modify any parental or legal rights, obligations, or authority established by an existing court order or deprive the parent or legal custodian of any parental or legal rights, obligations, or authority regarding the custody, visitation, or support of the child.\n\n2. The parent or legal custodian of the child shall have the authority to revoke or withdraw the power of attorney authorized in subsection 1 of this section at any time. Except as provided in subsection 7 of this section, if the delegation of authority lasts longer than one year, the parent or legal custodian of the child shall execute a new power of attorney for each additional year that the delegation exists.

Except as otherwise provided by law, if a parent or legal custodian uses a community service program that offers support services for families in crisis to assist in the delegation of any powers regarding the care and custody of a child by a properly executed power of attorney, then the execution of a power of attorney by such parent or legal custodian as authorized in subsection 1 of this section shall not constitute abandonment as provided in sections 568.030 and 568.032, or abuse or neglect as provided in sections 210.110 and 568.060, unless the parent or legal guardian fails to take custody of the child or execute a new power of attorney after the one-year time limit has elapsed. It shall be a violation of section 453.110 for any parent or legal custodian to execute a power of attorney with the intention of permanently avoiding or divesting himself or herself of parental or legal responsibility for the care of the child.\n\n5. Under a delegation of powers as authorized by subsection 1 of this section, the child or children subject to the power of attorney shall not be considered placed in foster care as otherwise defined in law and the parties shall not be subject to any of the requirements or licensing regulations for foster care or other regulations relating to community care for children.\n\n6. If a parent or legal custodian uses a community service program that offers support services for families in crisis to assist in the delegation of any powers regarding the care and custody of a child by a properly executed power of attorney, then the community service program shall ensure that a background check is completed for the attorney-in-fact and any adult members of his or her household prior to the placement of the child. A community service program shall not place a child or children with an attorney-in-fact when he or she or any adult member of his or her household is found to be on the sex offender registry as established pursuant to sections 589.400 to 589.425, or the child abuse and neglect registry, as established pursuant to section 210.109, or has pled guilty or nolo contendere to or is found guilty of a felony offense under federal or state law.

A background check performed under this section shall include:\n\n(1) A national and state fingerprint-based criminal history check;\n\n(2) A sex offender registry, as established pursuant to sections 589.400 to 589.425, check; and\n\n(3) A child abuse and neglect registry, as established pursuant to section 210.109, check.\n\n7. A parent or legal custodian who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States including any reserve component thereof, the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Public Health Service of the United States Department of Health and Human Services detailed by proper authority for duty with the Armed Forces of the United States, or who is required to enter or serve in the active military service of the United States under a call or order of the President of the United States or to serve on state active duty may delegate the powers designated in subsection 1 of this section for a period longer than one year if on active duty service. The term of delegation shall not exceed the term of active duty service plus thirty days.\n\n8. Nothing in this section shall conflict or set aside the preexisting residency requirements under section 167.020.

If enrollment is at a public school, attendance shall be based upon residency or waiver of such residency requirements by the school.\n\n9. If enrolled at any school, as soon as reasonably possible upon execution of a power of attorney for the temporary care of a child as authorized under this section, the child's school shall be notified of the existence of the power of attorney and be provided a copy of the power of attorney as well as the contact information for the attorney-in-fact. While the power of attorney is in force, the school shall communicate with both the attorney-in-fact and any parent or legal custodian with parental or legal rights, obligations, or authority regarding the custody, visitation, or support of the child. The school shall also be notified of the expiration, termination, or revocation of the power of attorney as soon as reasonably possible following such expiration, termination, or revocation and shall no longer communicate with the attorney-in-fact regarding the child upon the receipt of such notice.\n\n10. No delegation of powers under this section shall operate to modify a child's eligibility for benefits the child is receiving at the time of the execution of the power of attorney including, but not limited to, eligibility for free or reduced lunch, health care costs, or other social services, except as may be inconsistent with federal or state law governing the relevant program or benefit.\n\n(L. 2018 S.B. 819)",
