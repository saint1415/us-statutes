Unless any person interested in the probate of a will appears within six months after the date of the probate or rejection thereof by the probate division of the circuit court, or within six months after the first publication of notice of granting of letters on the estate of the decedent, whichever is later, and, by petition filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county, contests the validity of a probated will, or prays to have a will probated which has been rejected by the probate division of the circuit court, then probate or rejection of the will is binding. An heir, devisee, trustee or trust beneficiary under another purported will of the same decedent, and a person who has acquired, before or after the death of the testator, all or part of the interest of such heir or devisee by purchase, gift, devise, intestate succession, mortgage or lien, is interested in the probate of a will for purposes of this section.\n\n2. Whenever it is shown or appears to and is found by the judge of the probate division that any person interested in the probate of a will is a minor or mentally incapacitated person, and that the filing of a contest may be to the interest of the minor or person, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or person, who shall file or join in the contest within the time fixed by subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. It is not necessary to join as parties in a will contest persons whose interests will not be affected adversely by the result thereof. Subject to the provisions of section 472.300, persons not joined as parties in a will contest are not bound by the result thereof and have no rights in or to any consideration given for dismissal pursuant to subsection 8 of this section.\n\n4. Upon filing of the petition the clerk of the circuit court shall immediately notify the probate division of the circuit court and transmit to it a copy of the petition within ten days after its filing.\n\n5. Any contest of the validity of a probated will or any prayer to have probated a will which has been rejected by the judge of the probate division shall be heard before a circuit judge other than the judge of the probate division, provided, however, that with the consent of the judge of the probate division, such actions may be filed in or transferred to the probate division for hearing. Service of summons, petition, and subsequent pleadings thereto together with all subsequent proceedings in such will contest proceedings shall be governed by the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure and the provisions of The Civil Code of Missouri which are in effect.\n\n6. In any such action the petitioner shall proceed diligently to secure and complete service of process as provided by law on all parties defendant. If service of process is not secured and completed upon all parties defendant within ninety days after the petition is filed, the petition, on motion of any defendant duly served upon the petitioner or his attorney of record, in the absence of a showing by the petitioner of good cause for failure to secure and complete service, shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioner.\n\n7. If a timely petition is filed, it and the answer or answers thereto shall frame the issues of intestacy or testacy or which writing or writings constitute the decedent's will. The issues shall be tried by a jury, or if no party requires a jury, by the court, and the judgment thereon shall determine the issues. The verdict of jury or the finding and judgment of the court is final, saving to the court the right of granting a new trial and to the parties the right of appeal as in other cases.\n\n8. Any such action may be voluntarily dismissed, after the period of contest has expired, by consent of all parties not in default, at the cost of the party or parties designated, at any time prior to final judgment. Dismissal under this subsection shall not be considered a compromise of the action requiring court approval pursuant to sections 473.084 and 473.085, even though the parties have contractually agreed to an exchange of consideration for such dismissal or consent, and even though others similarly situated do not participate in such consideration.\n\n9.

Notwithstanding the limitation periods provided in section 473.050, the probate division of the circuit court, in its discretion, may at any time refuse to grant letters in the following cases:\n\n(1) When the estate of the decedent is not greater in amount than is allowed by law as exempt property and the allowance to the surviving spouse or unmarried minor children under section 474.260;\n\n(2) When the personal estate of the decedent does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars and there is no widower, widow or unmarried minor children, any creditor of the decedent whose claim has not been barred by section 473.444 or any creditor of the estate may apply for refusal of letters by giving bond in the sum of not less than the value of the estate, the bond to be approved by the court, conditioned upon the creditor's obligating himself or herself to pay, so far as the assets of the estate will permit, the debts of the decedent in the order of their preference, and to distribute the balance, if any, to the persons entitled to such balance under the law. Liability of the sureties on the bond shall terminate unless proceedings against them are instituted within two years after the bond is filed. The court may dispense with the filing of a bond if the court finds the bond is not necessary.\n\n2. Proof may be allowed by or on behalf of the widower, widow, unmarried minor children or creditor before the court of the value and nature of the estate, and if the court is satisfied that no estate will be left after allowing to the surviving spouse or unmarried minor children their exempt property and statutory allowances or that the personal estate does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars when application is made by a creditor, the court may order that no letters of administration shall be issued on the estate, unless, upon the application of other creditors or parties interested, the existence of other or further property is shown.\n\n3. After the making of the order, and until such time as it may be revoked, the surviving spouse, unmarried minor children or creditor may collect and sue for all the personal property belonging to the estate, if a surviving spouse or creditor, in the same manner and with the same effect as if the person had been appointed and qualified as executor or administrator of the estate, and if minor children, in the same manner and with the same effect as now provided by law for proceedings in court by infants in bringing suit.\n\n4. When the estate of the decedent includes real estate and its value, less liens and encumbrances, together with the personal property, is not greater in value than the exempt property and allowances to the surviving spouse or unmarried minor children, the surviving spouse or unmarried minor children are entitled to such real property and may make record evidence of title to such real property without appointment of an executor or administrator by filing in the office of the recorder of deeds of each county where the real property is situated a certified copy of the order of refusal of letters, describing the real property, naming the persons entitled to such real property and showing their right to succeed to the property.\n\n5. The surviving spouse or unmarried minor children who receive property of the estate under this section may retain such property, but a creditor receiving property under this section shall apply the proceeds of such property to debts of the estate in the order in which claims against the estate of deceased persons are now classified and preferred by law, and shall distribute the balance, if any, to the persons entitled thereto under the law. Upon compliance with this procedure, the real estate involved shall not thereafter be taken in execution for any debts or claims against the decedent, but the compliance has the effect of establishing the right of the surviving spouse or unmarried minor children to succeed to the real property; however, nothing in this section shall affect the right of secured creditors with respect to the real property.\n\n6.

Small estate — distribution of assets without letters, when — affidavit — procedure — fee. —1. Distributees of an estate which consists of personal property or real property or both personal and real property have a defeasible right to the personal property, and are entitled to the real property of such estate, as provided in this section, without awaiting the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The value of the entire estate, less liens, debt, and encumbrances, does not exceed forty thousand dollars;\n\n(2) Thirty days have elapsed since the death of the decedent and no application for letters or for administration or for refusal of letters under section 473.090 is pending or has been granted, or if such refusal has been granted and subsequently revoked;\n\n(3) A bond, in an amount not less than the value of the personal property, approved by the judge or clerk of the probate division is filed by the person making the required affidavit conditioned upon the payment of the debts of the decedent, including any debts to the state of Missouri, the expenses of funeral and burial and compliance with future orders of the court in relation to the estate of the decedent; and further conditioned that any part of the property to which the distributee is not entitled will be delivered to the persons entitled to the property under the law. Liability of the sureties on the bonds provided for in this section terminates unless proceedings against them are instituted within two years after the bond is filed; except that, the court may dispense with the filing of a bond if it finds that the same is not necessary;\n\n(4) A fee, in the amount prescribed in subsection 1 of section 483.580, and when required, the publication cost of the notice to creditors are paid or the proof of payment for such publication is provided to the clerk of the probate division.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the limitation periods set out in section 473.050, the affidavit required by this section may be made by the person designated as personal representative under the will of the decedent, if a will has been presented for probate within the limitation periods specified in section 473.050, otherwise by any distributee entitled to receive property of the decedent any time after thirty days after decedent's death, and shall set forth all of the following:\n\n(1) That the decedent left no will or, if the decedent left a will, that the will was presented for probate within the limitation periods specified in section 473.050;\n\n(2) That all unpaid debts, claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate and all estate taxes due, if any, on the property transfers involved have been or will be paid, except that any liability by the affiant for the payment of unpaid claims or demands shall be limited to the value of the property received;\n\n(3) An itemized description and valuation of property of the decedent. As used in this subdivision, the phrase \"property of the decedent\" shall not include property which was held by the decedent as a tenant by the entirety or a joint tenant at the time of the decedent's death;\n\n(4) The names and addresses of persons having possession of the property;\n\n(5) The names, addresses and relationship to the decedent of the persons entitled to and who will receive, the specific items of property remaining after payment of claims and debts of the decedent, included in the affidavit;\n\n(6) The facts establishing the right to such specific items of property as prescribed by this section.\n\n­­The certificate of the clerk shall be annexed to or endorsed on the affidavit and shall show the names and addresses of the persons entitled to the described property under the facts stated in the affidavit and shall recite that the will of decedent has been probated or that no will has been presented to the court and that all estate taxes on the property, if any are due, have been paid.\n\n3. A copy of the affidavit and certificate shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the probate division and copies of the affidavit and certificate shall be furnished by the clerk.\n\n4. The distributees mentioned in this section may establish their right to succeed to the real estate of the decedent by filing a copy of the foregoing affidavit and certificate of the clerk in the office of the recorder of deeds of each county where the real property is situated.\n\n5. When the value of the property listed in the affidavit is more than fifteen thousand dollars, the clerk shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county which qualifies under chapter 493 a notice to creditors of the decedent to file their claims in the court or be forever barred. The notice shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks. Proof of publication of notice pursuant to this section shall be filed not later than ten days after completion of the publication. The notice shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n6. Upon compliance with the procedure required by this section, the personal property and real estate involved shall not thereafter be taken in execution for any debts or claims against the decedent, but such compliance has the same effect in establishing the right of distributees to succeed to the property as if complete administration was had; but nothing in this section affects the right of secured creditors with respect to such property.\n\n7. The affiant shall collect the property of decedent described in the affidavit. The property of decedent shall be liquidated by the affiant to the extent necessary to pay debts of decedent. If the decedent's property is not sufficient to pay such debts, abatement of the shares of the distributees shall occur in accordance with section 473.620. The affiant shall distribute the remaining property to such persons identified in the affidavit as required in subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of this section who are entitled to receive the specific items of personal property, as described in the affidavit, or to have any evidence of such property transferred to such persons. To the extent necessary to facilitate distribution, the affiant may liquidate all or part of decedent's property.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 385 § 54, A.L. 1957 p. 829, A.L. 1967 p. 640, A.L. 1971 S.B. 19, A.L. 1973 S.B. 112, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1980 S.B. 637, A.L. 1981 S.B. 117, A.L. 1985 S.B. 35, et al., A.L. 1986 S.B. 787, A.L. 1993 S.B. 88, A.L. 1994 S.B. 701, A.L. 1996 S.B. 494, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1537)",

None of the following persons shall be appointed as a personal representative:\n\n(1) No full-time judge of any court of this state or clerk, deputy clerk or division clerk of any court, but a judge, clerk, deputy clerk or division clerk may serve as a personal representative for a decedent who was a spouse or who was within the third degree of relationship by consanguinity or affinity as calculated according to the civil law;\n\n(2) A person under the age of eighteen years or of unsound mind;\n\n(3) A person who is under legal disability as a result of conviction of a crime;\n\n(4) A habitual drunkard;\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided by section 362.600, a corporation, partnership or association organized under the law of a state or country other than the state of Missouri, or any United States national banking association having its principal place of business outside the state of Missouri;\n\n(6) No personal representative of a personal representative, in consequence thereof, shall be a personal representative of the first decedent.\n\n2.

However, upon the application of any heir or devisee, made in the probate division of the circuit court of the county for the removal of such personal representative, said presumption may be rebutted by evidence satisfactory to the court hearing the application, unless the will or some codicil or certificate attached thereto contains a recital that at or before the execution of the will the testator had advice or counsel in relation thereto from someone not under salary from such corporation. In the absence of such recital, the court may on such application and upon satisfactory evidence that said will was prepared by a salaried employee of the corporation revoke the appointment of and remove such corporation as personal representative.\n\n3. Before a nonresident of this state or a corporation organized under the laws of another state or country is issued letters testamentary or of administration he, she or it shall file in the probate division of the circuit court a designation, including the signature and address, of a resident of this state, or a corporation of this state authorized to administer trusts, as agent for the service of process on and the receipt of notice by such nonresident or foreign corporation. This designation shall be recited in the letters testamentary or of administration. Such a designation may be revoked only by a new designation of an agent for service and notice in this state, which shall be endorsed on the letters testamentary or of administration.

Service may be made upon such a personal representative in the manner in which service could have been made under other laws of this state on either the personal representative or his decedent immediately prior to death.

If a testator by will makes provision for the compensation of his personal representative, that shall be allowed and taken as his full compensation unless he files in the court a written instrument renouncing all claim for the compensation provided by the will before qualifying as personal representative. When no compensation is provided in the will, or when there is no will, or when the personal representative renounces all claim to the compensation provided in the will, the compensation of the personal representative shall be determined pursuant to this section. When there is only one personal representative he shall be allowed as the minimum compensation for his services the following percentages of the value of the personal property administered and of the proceeds of all real property sold under order of the probate court:\n\n­­In any case where reasonable compensation to the personal representative is in excess of the minimum provided in the above schedule, the court shall allow such additional compensation as will make the compensation of the personal representative reasonable and adequate. Performance by the personal representative of extraordinary services is not necessary to entitle him to such additional compensation. Such percentages shall be computed on the value of the personal property at the time of disbursement or distribution thereof, except that where it is necessary to allow compensation before the property is disbursed or distributed, or to allow compensation to a personal representative who has been succeeded by another personal representative, the court may determine the fair market value of property at the time of making the allowance and base such percentage thereon.\n\n2. When there are two or more joint or successor personal representatives they shall be allowed in the aggregate reasonable compensation for their services, not exceeding twice the minimum provided for in the schedule set forth in subsection 1 of this section or five percent of the value of the personal property administered and of the proceeds of the real property sold under order of the probate division, whichever is less, except that this maximum limitation shall not apply if possession has been taken of real property pursuant to order of the probate division but such real property has not been sold under order of the probate division, or if extraordinary services have been performed. Where there are two or more joint or successor personal representatives the compensation allowed them shall be apportioned among them by the court according to the services actually rendered by each, or as they may agree.\n\n3. Attorneys performing services for the estate at the instance of the personal representative shall be allowed out of the estate as the minimum compensation for their services sums equal to the percentages set forth in the schedule contained in subsection 1 of this section. In any case where reasonable compensation to the attorneys is in excess of the minimum provided in the schedule the court shall allow such additional compensation as will make the compensation of the attorneys reasonable and adequate. Performance by the attorneys of extraordinary services is not necessary to entitle them to such additional compensation. If the personal representative is an attorney, no allowance shall be made for legal services performed by him or at his instance unless such services are authorized by the will or by order of the court or are consented to by all heirs and devisees whose rights may be adversely affected by the allowance. In addition, when one member of a law firm or professional corporation serves as personal representative of the estate and another member of the same law firm or professional corporation serves as the attorney for the estate, only one fee as set forth in subsection 1 of this section shall be allowed.\n\n4. A personal representative may employ independent accountants, certified public accountants, or tax specialists holding a valid permit to practice before the United States Treasury Department to assist him in filing estate tax returns, federal and state income tax returns, or establishing records of account and reporting on financial results in those estates requiring this service and such person shall be allowed reasonable compensation for such service as determined by the court. If the personal representative is a certified public accountant, tax specialist holding a valid permit to practice before the United States Treasury Department or an independent accountant, no allowance shall be made for accountant services performed by him or at his instance unless such services are authorized by will or by order of the court or are consented to by all heirs and devisees whose rights may be adversely affected by the allowance. In addition, when one member of an accounting firm or professional corporation serves as an accountant for the estate, only one fee as set forth in subsection 1 of this section will be allowed.\n\n5. If the court finds that any accountant's services or actions in connection therewith are wrong, improper or injurious to the estate, no accountant fee whatsoever shall be allowed.\n\n6. Compensation properly allowable hereunder may be allowed to personal representatives or attorneys upon final settlement, or partial compensation upon application therefor, at any time or times during administration. If the court finds that a personal representative has failed to discharge his duties as such in any respect it may deny him any compensation whatsoever or may reduce the compensation which would otherwise be allowed. If the court finds that any attorney's services or actions in connection therewith are wrong, improper or injurious to the estate, no attorney fee whatever shall be allowed.\n\n7. No personal representative, other than one who is an attorney, may appear in court except by attorney, and such attorney may not be a salaried employee of the personal representative, but when the personal representative is an attorney, nothing herein shall prevent his being represented in court by a partner, associate or employee who is an attorney. Any personal representative may prepare and file his own inventories and settlements.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 385 § 73, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1980 S.B. 637, A.L. 1989 H.B. 145)\n\n(1956) Attorneys for heirs in will contest, through whose efforts additional assets were brought into the estate, held not entitled to fee payable from the estate because prior statutes made no provision therefor.

Execution of bond deemed appearance by surety — procedure on breach of obligation of bond. —1. The execution of the bond of a personal representative is deemed an appearance by the surety in the proceeding for the administration of the estate including all hearings with respect to the bond.\n\n2. On breach of the obligation of the bond of the personal representative, the court, after notice to the obligors in the bond and to such other persons as the court directs, may summarily determine the damages as a part of the proceeding for the administration of the estate, and by appropriate process enforce the collection thereof from those liable on the bond. The determination and enforcement may be made by the court upon its own motion or upon application of a successor personal representative, or of any other personal representative, or of any other interested person. The court may hear the application at the time of settling the accounts of the defaulting personal representative or at such other time as the court may direct. Damages shall be assessed on behalf of all interested persons and may be paid over to the successor or other nondefaulting personal representative and distributed as other assets held by the personal representative in his official capacity.\n\n3. If the court has already determined the liability of the personal representative, a surety shall not be permitted thereafter to deny liability in any action or hearing to determine their liability; but the surety may intervene in any hearing to determine the liability of the personal representative.\n\n4.

Any personal representative, administrator, creditor, beneficiary or other person who claims an interest in property which is claimed to be an asset of an estate or which is claimed should be an asset of an estate may file a verified petition in the probate division of the circuit court in which said estate is pending seeking determination of the title, or right of possession thereto, or both. The petition shall describe the property, if known, shall allege the nature of the interest of the petitioner and that title or possession of the property, or both, are being adversely withheld or claimed. The court may order the joinder, as a party, of any person who may claim an interest in or who may have possession of any such property.\n\n2. Service of summons, petition and answer thereto together with all subsequent proceedings shall be governed by the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure. Any party may demand a jury trial.\n\n3. Upon a trial of the issues, the court shall determine the persons who have an interest in said property together with the nature and extent of any such interest. The court shall direct the delivery or transfer of the title or possession, or both, of said property to the person or persons entitled thereto and may attach the person of any party refusing to make delivery as directed. If the party found to have adversely withheld the title or possession, or both, of said property has transferred or otherwise disposed of the same, the court shall render a money judgment for the value thereof with interest thereon from the date the property, or any interest therein, was adversely withheld. In addition to a judgment for title and possession, or either, or for the value thereof, the court may enter a judgment for all losses, expenses and damages sustained, if any, but not including attorney fees, if it finds that the property was wrongfully detained, transferred or otherwise disposed of.\n\n4.

For the purposes of this section, the providing of assistance shall create an obligation which may be recovered by filing a claim in the probate division of the circuit court against the decedent estate of the spouse of the deceased recipient upon such spouse's death as provided by the probate code of Missouri, chapters 472, 473, 474 and 475. The amount of the state debt shall be the full amount of assistance without interest provided to the recipient during the marriage of such recipient and spouse; provided that the liability of the obligor estate shall not exceed the value of the combined resources of the recipient and the spouse of the recipient on the date of death of the recipient.\n\n3. The state agency providing the assistance may initiate a claim on the debt against the obligor estate.\n\n4. The obligor estate may assert as a defense to the state agency's claim that more than two years prior to the providing of assistance, the recipient voluntarily abandoned the spouse.\n\n5. An obligor estate shall have the right of setoff against the state debt for any amounts recovered by the state agency from the estate of the deceased recipient pursuant to section 473.398.\n\n6.

The petition shall include all of the following known by, or can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by, the petitioner:\n\n(1) The name, age, domicile, last residence address and the fact and date of death of the decedent;\n\n(2) The names, relationship to the decedent and residence addresses of the heirs of the decedent at the time of the decedent's death;\n\n(3) The names and residence addresses of any persons claiming through an heir of the decedent when such heir has died after the decedent;\n\n(4) A particular description of the property of the decedent in this state with respect to which the determination is sought and the value of such property.\n\n2.

The notice shall be given by publication by publishing the notice once each week for four consecutive weeks, the last insertion of publication to be at least seven days before the date set for the hearing. In addition, notice under subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of section 472.100, or notice by registered or certified mail, as the court shall direct, shall be given to every person named in the petition whose address is known to the petitioner.\n\n4. Upon the hearing of the petition, the court shall make a decree determining the person or persons entitled to the property with respect to which a determination is sought, and their respective interest in the property as heirs or successors in interest to such heirs. The decree is conclusive evidence of the facts determined in such decree as against all parties to the proceedings.\n\n5.
