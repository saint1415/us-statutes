The following rules in subdivisions (1) to (15) of this subsection shall apply to all beneficiary designations except as otherwise provided by any governing instrument, the rules of any transferring entity, applicable law or the beneficiary designation:\n\n(1) A beneficiary designation or a request for registration of property in beneficiary form shall be made in writing, signed by the owner and dated, except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection;\n\n(2) A security that is not presently registered in the name of the owner may be registered in beneficiary form on instructions given by a broker or a person delivering the security;\n\n(3) A beneficiary designation may designate one or more primary beneficiaries and one or more contingent beneficiaries;\n\n(4) On property registered in beneficiary form, primary beneficiaries are the persons shown immediately following the transfer on death direction. Words indicating that the persons shown are primary beneficiaries are not required. If contingent beneficiaries are designated, their names in the registration shall be preceded by the words \"contingent beneficiaries\", or an abbreviation thereof, or words of similar meaning;\n\n(5) Unless a different percentage or fractional share is stated for each beneficiary, surviving multiple primary beneficiaries or multiple contingent beneficiaries share equally. When a percentage or fractional share is designated for multiple beneficiaries, either primary or contingent, surviving beneficiaries share in the proportion that their designated shares bear to each other;\n\n(6) Provision for a transfer of unequal shares to multiple beneficiaries for property registered in beneficiary form may be expressed in the registration by a number preceding the name of each beneficiary that represents a percentage share of the property to be transferred to that beneficiary. The number representing a percentage share need not be followed by the word \"percent\" or a percent sign;\n\n(7) A nonprobate transfer of property also transfers any interest, rent, royalties, earnings, dividends or credits earned or declared on the property, but not paid or credited before the owner's death;\n\n(8) If a distribution by a transferring entity pursuant to a nonprobate transfer results in fractional shares in a security or other property that is not divisible, the transferring entity may distribute the fractional shares in the name of all beneficiaries as tenants in common or as the beneficiaries may direct, or the transferring entity may sell the property, that is not divisible and distribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries in the proportions to which they are entitled;\n\n(9) On death of the owner, the property, less a setoff for all amounts and charges owing by the owner to the transferring entity, shall belong to the surviving beneficiaries, and their lineal descendants when required as substitutes, as follows:\n\n(a) If a multiple primary beneficiary does not survive and has no surviving lineal descendant substitutes, the nonsurviving primary beneficiary's share shall belong to the surviving primary beneficiaries in the proportion that their shares bear to each other;\n\n(b) If no primary beneficiary or lineal descendant substitute survives, the property shall belong to the surviving contingent beneficiaries in equal shares or in the percentage or fractional share stated;\n\n(c) If a multiple contingent beneficiary does not survive and has no lineal descendant substitutes, the nonsurviving contingent beneficiary's share shall belong to the surviving contingent beneficiaries in the proportion that their shares bear to each other;\n\n(d) If no beneficiary survives the owner, the property shall belong to the owner's estate;\n\n(10) If a trustee designated as a beneficiary does not survive the owner, resigns or is unable or unwilling to execute the trust as trustee, and, if within one year of the owner's death no successor trustee has been appointed or has undertaken to act, or if a trustee is designated as beneficiary and no trust instrument or probated will creating an express trust has been presented to the transferring entity, the transferring entity may in its discretion make the distribution as it would be made if the trust did not survive the owner;\n\n(11) If, within six months of the owner's death, the transferring entity has not been presented evidence that a nonsurviving beneficiary for whom LDPS distribution applies had lineal descendants who survived the owner, the transferring entity may in its discretion make the transfer as if the beneficiary's descendants, if any, did not survive the owner;\n\n(12) If a beneficiary cannot be located at the time the transfer is made to located beneficiaries, the transferring entity shall hold the missing beneficiary's share. If the missing beneficiary's share is not claimed by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's personal representative or successors within one year of the owner's death, the transferring entity shall transfer the share as if the beneficiary did not survive the owner. The transferring entity shall have no obligation to attempt to locate a missing beneficiary, to pay interest on the share held for a missing beneficiary or to invest the missing beneficiary's share in any different property. Cash, interest, rent, royalties, earnings or dividends payable to the missing beneficiary may be held by the transferring entity at interest or reinvested by the transferring entity in the account or in a dividend reinvestment account associated with a security held for the missing beneficiary;\n\n(13) If a transferring entity is required to make a nonprobate transfer to a minor or a disabled adult the transfer may be made pursuant to the Missouri transfers to minors law, chapter 404, the Missouri personal custodian law, chapter 404, or a similar law of another state;\n\n(14) A written request for execution of a nonprobate transfer may be made by any beneficiary, a beneficiary's legal representative or attorney in fact, or the owner's personal representative. The request shall be under oath or affirmation, subscribed before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths, and shall include the following:\n\n(a) The full name, address and tax identification number of each beneficiary;\n\n(b) The percentage or fractional share to be distributed to each beneficiary;\n\n(c) The manner in which percentage or fractional shares in nondivisible property or the proceeds therefrom are to be distributed;\n\n(d) A statement that there are no known disputes as to the persons entitled to a distribution under the nonprobate transfer or the amounts to be distributed to each person, and no known claims that would affect the distribution requested;\n\n(e) Such other information as the transferring entity may require;\n\n(15) A written request pursuant to subdivision (14) of this subsection shall be accompanied by the following:\n\n(a) Any certificate or instrument evidencing ownership of the contract, account, security or property;\n\n(b) Proof of death of the owner and any nonsurviving beneficiary;\n\n(c) An inheritance tax waiver from states that require it;\n\n(d) Where the request is made by a legal representative, a certified copy of the court order appointing the legal representative; and\n\n(e) Such other proof of entitlement as the transferring entity may require.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 145 § 37, A.L. 1995 S.B. 116)",

(1) The transferring entity shall have no duty to withhold making a transfer based on knowledge of any fact or claim adverse to the transfer to be made unless, prior to the transfer, the transferring entity has received written notice at a place and time and in a manner which affords a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the transfer is made, that:\n\n(a) Asserts a claim of beneficial interest in the transfer adverse to the transfer to be made;\n\n(b) Gives the name of the claimant and an address for communications directed to the claimant;\n\n(c) Identifies the deceased owner and the property to which the claim applies; and\n\n(d) States the amount and nature of the claim as it affects the transfer.\n\n(2) If a notice as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection is received by the transferring entity, the transferring entity may discharge any duty to the claimant by delivering a notice or sending a notice by certified mail to the claimant at the address given in the notice of claim advising that a transfer adverse to the claimant's asserted claim may be made in thirty days from the date of delivery or mailing unless the transfer is restrained by a court order. If the transferring entity so delivers or mails such a notice it shall withhold making the transfer for thirty days after the date of delivery or mailing and may then make the transfer unless restrained by a court order.\n\n(3) No other notice or other information shown to have been available to the transferring entity, its transfer agent and their employees, shall affect the right to the protections provided in sections 461.003 to 461.081.\n\n7.

A transfer by the transferring entity in accordance with sections 461.003 to 461.081 and pursuant to the beneficiary designation in good faith and in reliance on information the transferring entity reasonably believes to be accurate, discharges the transferring entity from all claims for the amounts paid and the property transferred.\n\n10.

Any protection provided to a transferring entity or to a purchaser or lender for value under sections 461.003 to 461.081 shall have no bearing on the rights of beneficiaries or others in disputes among themselves concerning the ownership of the property.\n\n2. Unless the payment or transfer can no longer be questioned because of adjudication, estoppel or limitations, a transferee of money or property pursuant to a nonprobate transfer that was improperly distributed or paid, is liable to return to the transferring entity or deliver to the rightful transferees the money or property improperly received and the income earned thereon by the transferee. If the transferee does not have the property, then the transferee is liable to return the value of the property as of the date of disposition, and the income and gain received by the transferee from the property and its proceeds.

Recipients of recoverable transfer to pay pro rata share of all property received to cover statutory allowances and claims due estate, enforced by action for accounting, time limitation — action effect on transferring entity. —1. Each recipient of a recoverable transfer of a decedent's property shall be liable to account for a pro rata share of the value of all such property received, to the extent necessary to discharge the statutory allowances to the decedent's surviving spouse and dependent children, and claims remaining unpaid after application of the decedent's estate, including expenses of administration and costs as provided in subsection 3 of this section, and including estate or inheritance or other transfer taxes imposed by reason of the decedent's death only where payment of those taxes is a prerequisite to satisfying unpaid claims which have a lower level of priority. No proceeding may be brought under this section when the deficiency described in this subsection is solely attributable to costs and expenses of administration.\n\n2. The obligation of a recipient of a recoverable transfer may be enforced by an action for accounting commenced within eighteen months following the decedent's death by the decedent's personal representative or a qualified claimant, but no action for accounting under this section shall be commenced by any qualified claimant unless the personal representative has received a written demand therefor by a qualified claimant, within sixteen months following the decedent's death. If the personal representative fails to commence an action within thirty days of the receipt of a written demand to do so, any qualified claimant may commence such action. If the personal representative fails to commence the action, the personal representative shall disclose to the qualified claimant or qualified claimants who made such written demand all material knowledge within the possession of the personal representative reasonably relating to the identity of any recipient of a recoverable transfer made by the decedent. In the event the personal representative fails to provide such information with respect to any recoverable transfer of the decedent's property to the personal representative, the eighteen-month limitation is tolled for such recoverable transfer until such time as the personal representative provides such information. In the event the personal representative is alleged in a verified pleading to be a recipient of a recoverable transfer from the decedent, the court may appoint an administrator ad litem to represent the estate in any proceeding brought pursuant to this section. Sums recovered in an action for accounting under this section shall be administered by the personal representative as part of the decedent's estate.\n\n3. The judgment in a proceeding authorized by this section shall take into account the expenses of administration of the estate including the cost of administering the additional assets obtained in the proceeding, and the costs of the proceeding to the extent authorized by this subsection. The court may order the costs of the proceeding, including attorney fees, to be treated as expenses of administration of the estate.\n\n4. If an action for accounting has been commenced under this section within eighteen months following the decedent's death, then any party to the proceeding may join and bring into the action for accounting any other recipient of a recoverable transfer of the decedent's property even if the other recipient is not joined until more than eighteen months following the decedent's death. If an action for accounting has been commenced under this section more than eighteen months following the decedent's death pursuant to the tolling provisions of subsection 2 of this section, then the personal representative, or former personal representative, who received a recoverable transfer of the decedent's property shall be liable to account under the provisions of subsection 1 of this section for the value of all such property received by such personal representative, or former personal representative, and no other recipient of a recoverable transfer of the decedent's property may be joined or brought into the action, and in such case, full recovery, rather than pro rata recovery, may be had from the recoverable property received by such personal representative or former personal representative.\n\n5. This section shall not affect the right of any transferring entity, as defined in section 461.005, to execute a direction of the decedent to make a payment or to make a recoverable transfer on death of the decedent, or make the transferring entity liable to the decedent's estate, unless before the payment or transfer is made the transferring entity has been served with process in a proceeding brought under this section and the transferring entity has had a reasonable time to act on it.\n\n6. This section does not create a lien on any property that is the subject of a recoverable transfer, except as a lien may be perfected by the way of attachment, garnishment, or judgment in an accounting proceeding authorized by this section.\n\n7. An action for accounting under the provisions of this section may be filed in the probate division of the circuit court, and the probate division of the circuit court may hear and determine questions and issue appropriate orders in an action for accounting under this section. Any proceeding under this section and any statements by a personal representative in connection with any recoverable transfer shall be deemed to be proceedings or statements under the probate code that are subject to section 472.013.\n\n8. The recipient of any property held in trust that was subject to the satisfaction of the decedent's debts immediately prior to the decedent's death, and the recipient of any property held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship that was subject to the satisfaction of the decedent's debts immediately prior to the decedent's death, are subject to this section, but only to the extent of the decedent's contribution to the value of the property.\n\n9. The provisions of this section shall apply to all actions commenced after August 28, 1995, except that with respect to decedents dying prior to August 28, 1995, an action for accounting under this section may be commenced within two years following the decedent's death.\n\n10. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Creditor\", any person to whom the decedent is liable, which liability survives whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and any person to whom the decedent's estate is liable for funeral expenses and the reasonable cost of a tombstone;\n\n(2)\"Dependent child\", the decedent's minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and the children who were in fact being supported by the decedent;\n\n(3)\"Qualified claimant\", a creditor, surviving spouse, dependent child, or a person acting for a dependent child of the decedent;\n\n(4)\"Recoverable transfer\", a nonprobate transfer of a decedent's property under sections 461.003 to 461.081 and any other transfer of a decedent's property other than from the administration of the decedent's probate estate that was subject to satisfaction of the decedent's debts immediately prior to the decedent's death, but only to the extent of the decedent's contribution to the value of such property.\n\n(L. 1995 S.B. 116, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1511)\n\n(2009) Section allows State to bring an action for accounting in the context of Medicaid estate recovery of the value of a nonprobate asset. In re Estate of Jones, 280 S.W.3d 647 (Mo.banc).\n\n(2014) In action for accounting by creditor against debtor's estate to recover value of nonprobate transfers, proper remedy was money judgment in amount of value of recoverable transfers, and in calculating amount recoverable by creditor, time for valuing property is date of debtor's death.
