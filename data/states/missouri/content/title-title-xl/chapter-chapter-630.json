A department residential facility may require that all money which is on the person of a patient or resident, which comes to a patient or resident, or which the facility receives in place of the patient or resident under a benefit arrangement or otherwise be turned over to the facility for safekeeping. The money shall be accounted for in the name of the patient or resident and recorded periodically in the records of the patient or resident.

A department facility may deny a patient or resident the access to and ability to spend or otherwise use the money in his account if it determines that the denial is essential in order to prevent the patient or resident from significantly dissipating his assets or that reasonable restrictions are necessary to protect the patient, resident or others. The department shall establish policies and procedures governing such determinations, including the evidence necessary to support a denial of the patient's or resident's rights. If a denial is made, the patient or resident may continue to spend or otherwise use the money in ways which would not constitute significant dissipation of the assets and which would sufficiently protect himself or others.\n\n5. The department facility shall deposit money accounted for in the name of a patient or resident with a financial institution.

If a patient in a mental health facility, or his parent if he is a minor, or his legal guardian refuses to consent to the proposed placement, the head of the mental health facility may petition the director of the division of comprehensive psychiatric services to determine whether the proposed placement is appropriate under sections 630.610, 630.615 and 630.620.\n\n3. The director of the division of comprehensive psychiatric services shall refer the petition to the chairman of the state advisory council for his division who shall appoint and convene a review panel composed of three members. At least one member of the panel shall be a family member or guardian of a patient who resides in a mental health facility operated by the department.

No member of the panel shall be an officer or employee of the department.\n\n4. After prompt notice and hearing, the panel shall determine whether the proposed placement is appropriate under sections 630.610, 630.615 and 630.620.

The court shall review the record, proceedings and decision of the director not only under the provisions of chapter 536, but also as to whether or not the head of the facility or the department sustained its burden of proof that the proposed placement is appropriate under sections 630.110, 630.115 and 630.120. The court shall expedite this review in all respects.

Compact enacted — form. —The \"Interstate Compact on Mental Health\" is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nTHE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\nThe contracting states solemnly agree that:\n\nThe party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a)\"Sending state\"shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(b)\"Receiving state\"shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(c)\"Institution\"shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\n(d)\"Patient\"shall mean any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state, for institutionalization or other care, treatment, or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\n(e)\"Aftercare\"shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release.\n\n(f)\"Mental illness\"shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.\n\n(g)\"Mental deficiency\"shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein.\n\n(h)\"State\"shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, he shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of his residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.\n\n(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.\n\n(c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient; furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient; given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish; and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient.\n\n(d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient.\n\n(e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient.\n\n(a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.\n\n(b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.\n\n(c) In supervising, treating, or caring for a patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care, and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.\n\nWhenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and out the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.\n\nThe duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\n(a) No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving state shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving state.\n\n(b) The sending state shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.\n\n(c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n\n(d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact.\n\n(e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\n(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish, or in any way impair the rights, duties, and responsibilities of any patient's guardian on his own behalf or in respect of any patient for whom he may serve, except that where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving state may make such supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the previous guardian shall upon being duly advised of the new appointment, and upon the satisfactory completion of such accounting and other acts as such court may by law require, relieve the previous guardian of power and responsibility to whatever extent shall be appropriate in the circumstances; provided, however, that in the case of any patient having settlement in the sending state, the court of competent jurisdiction in the sending state shall have the sole discretion to relieve a guardian appointed by it or continue his power and responsibility, whichever it shall deem advisable. The court in the receiving state may, in its discretion, confirm or reappoint the person or persons previously serving as guardian in the sending state in lieu of making a supplemental or substitute appointment.\n\n(b) The term\"guardian\"as used in paragraph (a) of this article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator, or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or responsibility for the person or property of a patient.\n\n(a) No provision of this compact except Article V shall apply to any person institutionalized while under sentence in a penal or correctional institution or while subject to trial on a criminal charge, or whose institutionalization is due to the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness or mental deficiency, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional institution.\n\n(b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\n(a) Each party state shall appoint a \"compact administrator\" who, on behalf of his state, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his state and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence, and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his state either in the capacity of sending or receiving state. The compact administrator or his duly designated representative shall be the official with whom other party states shall deal in any matter relating to the compact or any patient processed thereunder.\n\n(b) The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\nThe duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities, or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nThis compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\n(a) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect one year after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not change the status of any patient who has been sent to said state or sent out of said state pursuant to the provisions of the compact.\n\n(b) Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by Article VII(b) as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement and paragraph (a) hereof.\n\nARTICLE XIV\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1724)",

Contracts authorized, limitations. —The department of mental health and the department of corrections may negotiate and enter into contracts on behalf of this state pursuant to Article III of the compact and may perform such contracts; provided, that no funds, personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies or materials shall be pledged for, committed or used on account of any such contract, unless legally available therefor.\n\nTHE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS\n\n(a) The party states, desiring by common action to improve their programs for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to:\n\n1. Strengthen their own programs and laws for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered offender.\n\n2. Encourage and provide for such care and treatment in the most appropriate locations, giving due recognition to the need to achieve adequacy of diagnosis, care, treatment, aftercare and auxiliary services and facilities and, to every extent practicable, to do so in geographic locations convenient for providing a therapeutic environment.\n\n3. Authorize cooperation among the party states in providing services and facilities, when it is found that cooperative programs can be more effective and efficient than programs separately pursued.\n\n4. Place each mentally disordered offender in a legal status which will facilitate his care, treatment and rehabilitation.\n\n5. Authorize research and training of personnel on a cooperative basis, in order to improve the quality or quantity of personnel available for the proper staffing programs, services and facilities for mentally disordered offenders.\n\n6.

Set the limits within which such contracts may operate, so as to assure protection of the civil rights of mentally disordered offenders and protection of the rights and obligations of the public and of the party states.\n\n3. Facilitate the proper disposition of criminal charges pending against mentally disordered offenders, so that programs for their care, treatment and rehabilitation may be carried on efficiently.\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a)\"Mentally disordered offender\"means a person who has been determined, by adjudication or other method legally sufficient for the purpose in the party state where the determination is made, to be mentally ill and:\n\n1. Is under sentence for the commission of crime; or\n\n2. Who is confined or committed on account of the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional facility.\n\n(b)\"Patient\"means a mentally disordered offender who is cared for, treated, or transferred pursuant to this compact.\n\n(c)\"Sending state\"means a state party to this compact in which the mentally disordered offender was convicted; or the state in which he would be subject to trial on or conviction of an offense, except for his mental condition; or, within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state whose authorities have filed a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint.\n\n(d)\"Receiving state\"means a state party to this compact to which a mentally disordered offender is sent for care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation, or within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state in which a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint has been filed.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders on behalf of a sending state in facilities situated in receiving states, or for the participation of such mentally disordered offenders in programs of aftercare on conditional release administered by the receiving state. Any such contract shall provide for:\n\n1. Its duration.\n\n2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for patient care, treatment, and extraordinary services, if any.\n\n3. Determination of responsibility for ordering or permitting the furnishing of extraordinary services, if any.\n\n4.

Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states.\n\n(b) Prior to the construction or completion of construction of any facility for mentally disordered offenders or addition to such facility by a party state, any other party state or states may contract therewith for the enlargement of the planned capacity of the facility or addition thereto, or for the inclusion therein of particular equipment or structures, and for the reservation of a specific percentum of the capacity of the facility to be kept available for use by patients of the sending state or states so contracting. Any sending state so contracting may, to the extent that moneys are legally available therefor, pay to the receiving state, a reasonable sum as consideration for such enlargement of capacity, or provision of equipment or structures, and reservation of capacity. Such payment may be in a lump sum or in installments as provided in the contract.\n\n(c) A party state may contract with any one or more other party states for the training of professional or other personnel whose services, by reason of such training, would become available for or be improved in respect of ability to participate in the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders. Such contracts may provide for such training to take place at any facility being operated or to be operated for the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders; at any institution or facility having resources suitable for the offering of such training; or may provide for the separate establishment of training facilities, provided that no such separate establishment shall be undertaken, unless it is determined that an appropriate existing facility or institution cannot be found at which to conduct the contemplated program. Any contract entered into pursuant to this paragraph shall provide for:\n\n1. The administration, financing, and precise nature of the program.\n\n2. The status and employment or other rights of the trainees.\n\n3. All other necessary matters.\n\n(d) No contract entered into pursuant to this compact shall be inconsistent with any provision thereof.\n\n(a) Whenever the duly constituted judicial or administrative authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that custody, care and treatment in, or transfer of a patient to, a facility within the territory of another party state, or conditional release for aftercare in another party state is necessary in order to provide adequate care and treatment or is desirable in order to provide an appropriate program of therapy or other treatment, or is desirable for clinical reasons, said officials may direct that the custody, care and treatment be within a facility or in a program of aftercare within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n\n(b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any facility in which it has a contractual right to secure care or treatment of patients for the purpose of inspection and visiting such of its patients as may be in the facility or served by it.\n\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in Article VI, patients in a facility pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed for transfer to a facility within the sending state, for transfer to another facility in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to secure care and treatment of patients, for release on aftercare or other conditional status, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.\n\n(d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the patients of that sending state in facilities pursuant to this compact including a psychiatric and behavioral record of each patient and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each patient may have the benefit of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said patient in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n\n(e) All patients who may be in a facility or receiving aftercare from a facility pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be cared for, treated and supervised in accordance with the standards pertaining to the program administered at the facility. The fact of presence in a receiving state shall not deprive any patient of any legal rights which said patient would have had if in custody or receiving care, treatment or supervision as appropriate in the sending state.\n\n(f) Any hearing or hearings to which a patient present in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state shall be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. Costs of records made pursuant to this paragraph shall be borne by the sending state.\n\n(g) Patient confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the patient, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n\n(h) Any patient pursuant to the terms of this compact shall be subject to civil process and shall have any and all rights to sue, be sued and participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligation modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if in any appropriate facility of the sending state or being supervised therefrom, as the case may be, located within such state.\n\n(i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any patient shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any patient pursuant to the terms of this compact.\n\n(a) Whenever the authorities responsible for the care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender, whether convicted or adjudicated in the state or subject to care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation pursuant to a contract, are of the opinion that charges based on untried indictments, informations or complaints in another party state present obstacles to the proper care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender or to the planning or execution of a suitable program for him, such authorities may petition the appropriate court in the state where the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending for prompt disposition thereof. If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this paragraph.\n\n(b) The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within thirty days of the filing thereof. Such hearing shall be only to determine whether the proper safeguarding and advancement of the public interest; the condition of the mentally disordered offender; and the prospects for more satisfactory care, treatment and rehabilitation of him warrant disposition of the untried indictment, information or complaint prior to termination of the defendant's status as a mentally disordered offender in the sending state. The prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction from which the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending, the petitioning authorities, and such other persons as the court may determine shall be entitled to be heard.\n\n(c) Upon any hearing pursuant to this Article, the court may order such adjournments or continuances as may be necessary for the examination or observation of the mentally disordered offender or for the securing of necessary evidence. In granting or denying any such adjournment or continuance, the court shall give primary consideration to the purposes of this compact, and more particularly to the need for expeditious determination of the legal and mental status of a mentally disordered offender so that his care, treatment and discharge to the community only under conditions which will be consonant with the public safety may be implemented.\n\n(d) The presence of a mentally disordered offender within a state wherein a petition is pending or being heard pursuant to this Article, or his presence within any other state through which he is being transported in connection with such petition or hearing, shall be only for the purposes of this compact, and no court, agency or person shall have or obtain jurisdiction over such mentally disordered offender for any other purpose by reason of his presence pursuant to this Article. The mentally disordered offender shall, at all times, remain in the custody of the sending state. Any acts of officers, employees, or agencies of the receiving state in providing or facilitating detention, housing or transportation for the mentally disordered offender shall be only as agents for the sending state.\n\n(e) Promptly upon conclusion of the hearing the court shall dismiss the untried indictment, information or complaint, if it finds that the purposes enumerated in paragraph (b) of this Article would be served thereby. Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state.\n\n(f) No fact or other matter established or adjudicated at any hearing pursuant to this Article, or in connection therewith, shall be deemed established or adjudicated, nor shall the same be admissible in evidence, in any subsequent prosecution of the untried indictment, information or complaint concerned in a petition filed pursuant to this Article unless:\n\n1. The defendant or his duly empowered legal representative requested or expressly acquiesced in the making of the petition, and was afforded an opportunity to participate in person in the hearing; or\n\n2. The defendant himself offers or consents to the introduction of the determination or adjudication at such subsequent proceedings.\n\n(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove a patient from the receiving state there is pending against the patient within such state any criminal charge or if the patient is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the patient shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport patients pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.\n\n(b) A patient who escapes while receiving care and treatment or who violates provisions of aftercare by leaving the jurisdiction, or while being detained or transported pursuant to this compact shall be deemed an escapee from the sending state and from the state in which the facility is situated or the aftercare was being provided. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any facility or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto and any patient in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision; provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary regimen of the facility or program the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nThis compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states from among the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states, or any other state upon similar action by such state.\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two years after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such patients as it may have in other party states pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the custody, care, treatment, rehabilitation or aftercare of patients nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative arrangements.\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1724, A.L. 1990 H.B. 974)",
