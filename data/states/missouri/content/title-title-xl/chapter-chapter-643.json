Construction without permit prohibited — denial, appeal, procedure — fee, exemption — natural resources protection fund, air pollution permit fee subaccount — city or county permit granted, effect. —1. It shall be unlawful for any person to commence construction of any air contaminant source in this state, without a permit, if such source is of a class fixed by regulation of the commission which requires a permit.\n\n2. Every source required to obtain a construction permit shall make application to the department that includes such plans and specifications as prescribed by rule. The director shall promptly investigate each application, and if he or she determines that the source meets and will meet the requirements of sections 643.010 to 643.190 and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, he or she shall issue a construction permit with such conditions as he deems necessary to ensure that the source will meet the requirements of sections 643.010 to 643.190 and the rules. An application submitted for the construction or modification and operation of any regulated air contaminant source shall receive a unified construction and operating permit review process under section 643.078, unless the applicant requests in writing that the construction and operating permits be reviewed separately. If the director determines that the source does not meet or will not meet the requirements of sections 643.010 to 643.190 and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, he or she shall deny the construction permit.\n\n3. Before issuing a construction permit to build or modify an air contaminant source the director shall determine if the ambient air quality standards in the vicinity of the source are being exceeded and shall determine the impact on the ambient air quality standards from the source. The director, in order to effectuate the purposes of sections 643.010 to 643.190, may deny a construction permit if the source will appreciably affect the air quality or the air quality standards are being substantially exceeded.\n\n4. The director may require the applicant as a condition to the issuance of the construction permit to provide and maintain such facilities or to conduct such tests as are necessary to determine the nature, extent, quantity or degree of air contaminants discharged into the ambient air from the proposed source.\n\n5. The director shall act within thirty days after a request for approval of an application for a construction permit. The director shall render a decision to approve or deny a construction permit within ninety days of receipt of a complete application for a class B source and within one hundred eighty-four days of receipt of a complete application for a class A source. The director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his action and if the construction permit is denied state the reasons for such denial.\n\n6. As provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013, any aggrieved person may appeal any permit decision made under this section, including failure to render a decision within the time period established in this section. A notice of appeal shall be filed with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the director's action or within thirty days from the date by which the decision should have been rendered if the director has failed to act. Once the administrative hearing commission has reviewed the appeal, the administrative hearing commission shall issue a recommended decision to the commission on permit issuance, renewal, denial, suspension, or revocation, or any condition of the permit. The commission shall issue its own decision, based on the appeal, for permit issuance, renewal, denial, suspension, or revocation, or any condition of the permit. If the commission changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commission shall mail copies of its final decision to the parties to the appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the air contaminant source is located or is to be located shall have original jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available until and unless all administrative remedies are exhausted.\n\n7. (1) There shall be a one hundred dollar filing fee payable to the state of Missouri with each application before a construction permit shall be issued. No manufacturing or processing plant or operating location or other air contaminant source shall be required to pay more than one filing fee with a construction permit application. The provisions of this section shall not apply nor require the issuance of a permit wherein the proposed construction is that of a private residence.\n\n(2) Upon completion of the department's evaluation of the application, but before receiving a construction permit, the applicant shall reimburse the department for all reasonable costs incurred by the department whether or not a construction permit is issued by the department or withdrawn by the applicant. If the department fails to approve or deny a construction permit within the time period specified in this section, the applicant shall not be required to reimburse the department for the review of the construction permit application. The commission shall, by rule, set the hourly charge, not to exceed the actual cost thereof and not to exceed fifty dollars per hour, for review of each construction permit application. The commission may exempt any person from payment of the hourly fees under this subdivision, or may reduce such fees, upon an appeal filed with the commission by such person stating that the fee will create an unreasonable economic hardship upon such person. The commission may conduct a closed meeting and have closed records, as defined in section 610.010, for the purpose of gathering information from the person filing an appeal for the exemption. Information obtained in this meeting may be held confidential by the commission upon the request of the person filing the appeal for exemption. If the fees or any portion of the fees imposed by this section are not paid within ninety days from the date of billing there shall be imposed interest upon the unpaid amount at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date of billing until payment is actually made. A construction permit application for a portable facility may include any site at which the portable facility is expected to be used; however, a separate site permit application shall be required when the portable facility is used or expected to be used at any site which is not included in a previously approved construction permit application. Upon receipt of the application, the applicant shall be notified by the department of hourly fees and requirements put forth in this subdivision.\n\n(3) Applicants who withdraw their application before the department completes its evaluation shall reimburse the department for costs incurred in the evaluation.\n\n(4) All moneys received pursuant to this section and section 643.073 and any other moneys so designated shall be placed in the state treasury and credited to the natural resources protection fund air pollution permit fee subaccount, created in section 640.220, and shall be expended for the administration of this section and sections 643.073 and 643.078 and for no other purpose, and shall be used to supplement state general revenue and federal funds appropriated to the department. After appropriation, the moneys received pursuant to this section and in such fund subaccount shall be expended for the administration of this section and for no other purpose. Any unexpended balance in such fund subaccount at the end of any appropriation period shall not be transferred to the general revenue fund of the state treasury and shall be exempt from the provisions of section 33.080. Any interest received on such deposits shall be credited to the fund subaccount.\n\n8. Any person who obtains a valid permit from a city or county pursuant to the authority granted in section 643.140 shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this section and shall not be liable to the department for construction permit fees imposed pursuant to subsection 7 of this section.\n\n(L. 1972 H.B. 1184, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1187, A.L. 1992 S.B. 544, A.L. 2015 H.B. 92)",

It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any regulated air contaminant source after August 28, 1992, without an operating permit except as otherwise provided in sections 643.010 to 643.190.\n\n2. At the option of the permit applicant, a single operating permit shall be issued for a facility having multiple air contaminant sources located on one or more contiguous tracts of land, excluding public roads, highways and railroads, under the control of or owned by the permit holder and operated as a single enterprise.\n\n3. Any person who wishes to construct or modify and operate any regulated air contaminant source shall submit an application to the department for the unified review of a construction permit application under section 643.075 and an operating permit application under this section, unless the applicant requests in writing that the construction and operating permit applications be reviewed separately. The director shall complete any unified review within one hundred*eighty days of receipt of the request for a class B source. For a class A source, the unified review shall be completed within the time period established in Section 502 of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661.\n\n4. As soon as the review process is completed for the construction and operating permits and, if the applicant complies with all applicable requirements of sections 643.010 to 643.190 and all rules adopted thereunder, the construction permit shall be issued to the applicant. The operating permit shall be retained by the department until validated.\n\n5. Within one hundred*eighty days of commencing operations, the holder of a construction permit shall submit to the director such information as is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of sections 643.010 to 643.190 and the terms and conditions of the construction permit. The operating permit retained by the department shall be validated and forwarded to the applicant if the applicant is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the construction permit and the terms and conditions of the operating permit. The holder of a construction permit may request a waiver of the one hundred*eighty day time period and the director may grant such request by mutual agreement.\n\n6. If the director determines that an air contaminant source does not meet the terms and conditions of the construction permit and that the operation of the source will result in emissions which exceed the limits established in the construction permit, he shall not validate the operating permit. If the source corrects the deficiency, the director shall then validate the operating permit. If the source is unable to correct the deficiency, then the director and the applicant may, by mutual agreement, add such terms and conditions to the operating permit which are deemed appropriate, so long as the emissions from the air contaminant source do not exceed the limits established in the construction permit, and the director shall validate the operating permit. The director may add terms and conditions to the operating permit which allow the source to exceed the emission limits established in the construction permit. In such a case, the director shall notify the affected public and the commission shall, upon request by any affected person, hold a public hearing upon the revised operating permit application.\n\n7. Except as provided in subsection 8 of this section, an operating permit shall be valid for five years from the date of issuance or validation, whichever is later, unless otherwise revoked or terminated pursuant to sections 643.010 to 643.190.\n\n8. An applicant for a construction permit for an air contaminant source with valid operating permit may request that the air contaminant source be issued a new five-year operating permit. The operating permit would be issued in the manner and under the conditions provided in sections 643.010 to 643.190 and would supersede any existing operating permit for the source.\n\n9. The director shall take action within thirty days after a request for validation of the operating permit and shall render a decision within one hundred twenty days of receipt of a request for issuance of an operating permit for a class B source. The director shall render a decision within the time period established in Section 502 of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661, for a class A source. Any affected person may appeal any permit decision, including failure to render a decision within the time period established in this section, to the administrative hearing commission as provided by subsection 16 of this section, section 621.250, and section 640.013.\n\n10. The director may suspend, revoke or modify an operating permit for cause.\n\n11. The director shall not approve an operating permit if he receives an objection to approval of the permit from the United States Environmental Protection Agency within the time period specified under Title V of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661, et seq.\n\n12. The director shall enforce all applicable federal rules, standards and requirements issued under the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661, et seq., and shall incorporate such applicable standards and any limitations established pursuant to Title III into operating permits as required under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661, et seq.\n\n13. Applicable standards promulgated by the commission by rule shall be incorporated by the director into the operating permit of any air contaminant source which has, on the effective date of the rule, at least three years remaining before renewal of its operating permit. If less than three years remain before renewal of the source's operating permit, such applicable standards shall be incorporated into the permit unless the permit contains a shield from such new requirements consistent with Title V of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661, et seq.\n\n14. The holder of a valid operating permit shall have operational flexibility to make changes to any air contaminant source, if the changes will not result in air contaminant emissions in excess of those established in the operating permit or result in the emissions of any air contaminant not previously emitted without obtaining a modification of the operating permit provided such changes are consistent with Section 502(b)(10) of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661.\n\n15. An air contaminant source with a valid operating permit which submits a complete application for a permit renewal at least six months prior to the expiration of the permit shall be deemed to have a valid operating permit until the director acts upon its permit application. The director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his action on the application and if the operating permit is not issued state the reasons therefor.\n\n16. The applicant may appeal to the administrative hearing commission if a construction, modification, or operating permit is not issued, or renewed by the department, or may appeal any condition, suspension, modification or revocation of any permit by filing a petition with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the notice of the director's response to the request for issuance of the construction, modification, or operating permit as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013. Once the administrative hearing commission has reviewed the appeal, the administrative hearing commission shall issue a recommended decision to the commission on the issuance, renewal, denial, suspension, modification, revocation, or any condition of the permit. The commission shall issue its own decision, based on the appeal, for the issuance, renewal, denial, suspension, modification, revocation, or any condition of the permit.

The commission shall mail copies of its final decision to the parties to the appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the air contaminant source is located or is to be located shall have original jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available until and unless all administrative remedies are exhausted.\n\n17.

If, in the opinion of the director, the investigation yields reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of sections 643.010 to 643.355 is occurring or has occurred, he shall refer such information to either or both the attorney general or the county prosecutor of the county where the violations are alleged to have occurred.\n\n3. If, in the opinion of the director, the investigation discloses that a violation does exist which would not be a criminal violation, he may by conference, conciliation and persuasion endeavor to eliminate the violation.\n\n4. In case of the failure by conference, conciliation and persuasion to correct or remedy any violation, the director may order abatement, suspend or revoke a permit, whichever action or actions the director deems appropriate.

Fees, amount — deposit of moneys, where, subaccount to be maintained — civil action for failure to remit fees, effect upon permit — agencies, determination of fees — fee structure revision. —1. Any air contaminant source required to obtain a permit issued under sections 643.010 to 643.355 shall pay annually beginning April 1, 1993, a fee as provided herein. For the first year the fee shall be twenty-five dollars per ton of each regulated air contaminant emitted. Thereafter, the fee shall be set every three years by the commission by rule and shall be at least twenty-five dollars per ton of regulated air contaminant emitted but not more than forty dollars per ton of regulated air contaminant emitted in the previous calendar year. If necessary, the commission may make annual adjustments to the fee by rule. The fee shall be set at an amount consistent with the need to fund the reasonable cost of administering sections 643.010 to 643.355, taking into account other moneys received pursuant to sections 643.010 to 643.355. For the purpose of determining the amount of air contaminant emissions on which the fees authorized under this section are assessed, a facility shall be considered one source as described in subsection 2 of section 643.078, except that a facility with multiple operating permits shall pay the emission fees authorized under this section separately for air contaminants emitted under each individual permit.\n\n2. A source which produces charcoal from wood shall pay an annual emission fee under this subsection in lieu of the fee established in subsection 1 of this section. The fee shall be based upon a maximum fee of twenty-five dollars per ton and applied upon each ton of regulated air contaminant emitted for the first four thousand tons of each contaminant emitted in the amount established by the commission pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, reduced according to the following schedule:\n\n(1) For fees payable under this subsection in the years 1993 and 1994, the fee shall be reduced by one hundred percent;\n\n(2) For fees payable under this subsection in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997, the fee shall be reduced by eighty percent;\n\n(3) For fees payable under this subsection in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, the fee shall be reduced by sixty percent.\n\n3. The fees imposed in subsection 2 of this section shall not be imposed or collected after the year 2000 unless the general assembly reimposes the fee.\n\n4. Each air contaminant source with a permit issued under sections 643.010 to 643.355 shall pay the fee for the first four thousand tons of each regulated air contaminant emitted each year but no air contaminant source shall pay fees on total emissions of regulated air contaminants in excess of twelve thousand tons in any calendar year. A permitted air contaminant source which emitted less than one ton of all regulated pollutants shall pay a fee equal to the amount per ton set by the commission. An air contaminant source which pays emission fees to a holder of a certificate of authority issued pursuant to section 643.140 may deduct such fees from any amount due under this section. The fees imposed in this section shall not be applied to carbon oxide emissions. The fees imposed in subsection 1 of this section and this subsection shall not be applied to sulfur dioxide emissions from any Phase I affected unit subject to the requirements of Title IV, Section 404, of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7651 et seq., any sooner than January 1, 2000. The fees imposed on emissions from Phase I affected units shall be consistent with and shall not exceed the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Any such fee on emissions from any Phase I affected unit shall be reduced by the amount of the service fee paid by that Phase I affected unit pursuant to subsection 8 of this section in that year. Any fees that may be imposed on Phase I sources shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection 1 of this section and this subsection and shall not be applied retroactively.\n\n5. Moneys collected under this section shall be transmitted to the director of revenue for deposit in appropriate subaccounts of the natural resources protection fund created in section 640.220. A subaccount shall be maintained for fees paid by air contaminant sources which are required to be permitted under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7661 et seq., and used, upon appropriation, to fund activities by the department to implement the operating permits program authorized by Title V of the federal Clean Air Act, as amended. Another subaccount shall be maintained for fees paid by air contaminant sources which are not required to be permitted under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act as amended, and used, upon appropriation, to fund other air pollution control program activities. Another subaccount shall be maintained for service fees paid under subsection 8 of this section by Phase I affected units which are subject to the requirements of Title IV, Section 404, of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section 7651c), as amended, and used, upon appropriation, to fund air pollution control program activities. The provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, moneys in the fund shall not revert to general revenue at the end of each biennium. Interest earned by moneys in the subaccounts shall be retained in the subaccounts. The per-ton fees established under subsection 1 of this section may be adjusted annually, consistent with the need to fund the reasonable costs of the program, but shall not be less than twenty-five dollars per ton of regulated air contaminant nor more than forty dollars per ton of regulated air contaminant. The first adjustment shall apply to moneys payable on April 1, 1994, and shall be based upon the general price level for the twelve-month period ending on August thirty-first of the previous calendar year.\n\n6. The department may initiate a civil action in circuit court against any air contaminant source which has not remitted the appropriate fees within thirty days. In any judgment against the source, the department shall be awarded interest at a rate determined pursuant to section 408.030 and reasonable attorney's fees. In any judgment against the department, the source shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n7. The department shall not suspend or revoke a permit for an air contaminant source solely because the source has not submitted the fees pursuant to this section.\n\n8. Any Phase I affected unit which is subject to the requirements of Title IV, Section 404, of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section 7651c), as amended, shall pay annually beginning April 1, 1993, and terminating December 31, 1999, a service fee for the previous calendar year as provided herein. For the first year, the service fee shall be twenty-five thousand dollars for each Phase I affected generating unit to help fund the administration of sections 643.010 to 643.355. Thereafter, the service fee shall be annually set by the commission by rule, following public hearing, based on an annual allocation prepared by the department showing the details of all costs and expenses upon which such fees are based consistent with the department's reasonable needs to administer and implement sections 643.010 to 643.355 and to fulfill its responsibilities with respect to Phase I affected units, but such service fee shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars per generating unit. Any such Phase I affected unit which is located on one or more contiguous tracts of land with any Phase II generating unit that pays fees under subsection 1 or subsection 2 of this section shall be exempt from paying service fees under this subsection. A\"contiguous tract of land\"shall be defined to mean adjacent land, excluding public roads, highways and railroads, which is under the control of or owned by the permit holder and operated as a single enterprise.\n\n9. The department of natural resources shall determine the fees due pursuant to this section by the state of Missouri and its departments, agencies and institutions, including two- and four-year institutions of higher education. The director of the department of natural resources shall forward the various totals due to the joint committee on capital improvements and the directors of the individual departments, agencies and institutions. The departments, as part of the budget process, shall annually request by specific line item appropriation funds to pay said fees and capital funding for projects determined to significantly improve air quality. If the general assembly fails to appropriate funds for emissions fees as specifically requested, the departments, agencies and institutions shall pay said fees from other sources of revenue or funds available. The state of Missouri and its departments, agencies and institutions may receive assistance from the small business technical assistance program established pursuant to section 643.173.\n\n10. Each retail agricultural facility that uses, stores, or sells anhydrous ammonia that is an air contaminant source subject to the risk management plan under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(r), as amended, shall pay an annual registration fee of two hundred dollars. In addition, each retail agricultural facility that uses, stores, or sells anhydrous ammonia shall pay an annual tonnage fee calculated on the number of tons of anhydrous ammonia sold. The initial retail tonnage fee shall be set at one dollar and twenty-five cents per ton of anhydrous ammonia used or sold. Each distributor or terminal agricultural facility that uses, stores, or sells anhydrous ammonia that is an air contaminant source subject to the risk management plan program 3 under 40 CFR Part 68 shall pay an annual registration fee of five thousand dollars and shall not pay a tonnage fee. The annual registration fees and tonnage fee may be periodically revised under subsection 11 of this section. However, the fees collected shall be used exclusively for the purposes of administering the provisions of 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(r), as amended, for such agricultural facilities. Fees paid by agricultural air contaminant sources that use, store, or sell anhydrous ammonia for the purposes of implementing the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(r), as amended, shall be deposited into the anhydrous ammonia risk management plan subaccount within the natural resources protection fund created in section 643.245. If the funding exceeds the reasonable costs to administer the programs as set forth in this section, the department of natural resources shall reduce fees for all registrants if the fees derived exceed the reasonable cost of administering the risk management plan under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(r), as amended.\n\n*11. Notwithstanding any statutory fee amounts or maximums to the contrary, the department of natural resources may conduct a comprehensive review and propose changes to the fee structure authorized by sections 643.073, 643.075, 643.079, 643.225, 643.228, 643.232, 643.237, and 643.242 after holding stakeholder meetings in order to solicit stakeholder input from each of the following groups: the asbestos industry, electric utilities, mineral and metallic mining and processing facilities, cement kiln representatives, and any other interested industrial or business entities or interested parties. The department shall submit a proposed fee structure with stakeholder agreement to the air conservation commission. The commission shall review such recommendations at the forthcoming regular or special meeting, but shall not vote on the fee structure until a subsequent meeting. If the commission approves, by vote of two-thirds majority or five of seven commissioners, the fee structure recommendations, the commission shall authorize the department to file a notice of proposed rulemaking containing the recommended fee structure, and after considering public comments, may authorize the department to file the order of rulemaking for such rule with the joint committee on administrative rules pursuant to sections 536.021 and 536.024 no later than December first of the same year. If such rules are not disapproved by the general assembly in the manner set out below, they shall take effect on January first of the following calendar year and the previous fee structure shall expire upon the effective date of the commission-adopted fee structure. Any regulation promulgated under this subsection shall be deemed to be beyond the scope and authority provided in this subsection, or detrimental to permit applicants, if the general assembly, within the first sixty calendar days of the regular session immediately following the filing of such regulation, by concurrent resolution disapproves the regulation by concurrent resolution. If the general assembly so disapproves any regulation filed under this subsection, the commission shall continue to use the previous fee structure. The authority of the commission to further revise the fee structure as provided by this subsection shall expire on August 28, 2030. If the commission's authority to revise the fee structure as provided by this subsection expires, the fee structure in place at the time of expiration shall remain in place.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 544, A.L. 2005 H.B. 824, A.L. 2007 S.B. 54, A.L. 2011 H.B. 89, A.L. 2013 H.B. 28 merged with H.B. 650, A.L. 2014 S.B. 642, A.L. 2022 1st Ex.

Administrative penalties, assessment, restriction — conference, conciliation and persuasion — rules — payment — appeal — collection, disposition. —1. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, upon a determination by the director that a provision of sections 643.010 to 643.250, or a standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, or a term or condition of any permit has been violated, the director may issue an order assessing an administrative penalty upon the violator under this section. An administrative penalty shall not be imposed until the director has sought to resolve the violations through conference, conciliation and persuasion and shall not be imposed for minor violations of sections 643.010 to 643.250 or minor violations of any standard, limitation, order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to sections 643.010 to 643.250 or minor violations of any term or condition of a permit issued pursuant to sections 643.010 to 643.250. If the violation is resolved through conference, conciliation and persuasion, no administrative penalty shall be assessed unless the violation has caused, or has the potential to cause, a risk to human health or to the environment, or has caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. Any order assessing an administrative penalty shall state that an administrative penalty is being assessed under this section and that the person subject to the penalty may appeal as provided by this section. Any such order that fails to state the statute under which the penalty is being sought, the manner of collection or rights of appeal shall result in the state's waiving any right to collection of the penalty.\n\n2. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations for the assessment of administrative penalties. The amount of the administrative penalty assessed per day of violation for each violation under this section shall not exceed the amount of the civil penalty specified in section 643.151. Such rules shall reflect the criteria used for the administrative penalty matrix as provided for in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6928(a), Section 3008(a), and the harm or potential harm which the violation causes, or may cause, the violator's previous compliance record, and any other factors which the department may reasonably deem relevant. An administrative penalty shall be paid within sixty days from the date of issuance of the order assessing the penalty. Any person subject to an administrative penalty may appeal to the commission. Any appeal will stay the due date of such administrative penalty until the appeal is resolved. Any person who fails to pay an administrative penalty by the final due date shall be liable to the state for a surcharge of fifteen percent of the penalty plus ten percent per annum on any amounts owed. Any administrative or civil penalty paid pursuant to sections 643.010 to 643.250 shall be handled in accordance with Section 7 of Article IX of the State Constitution. An action may be brought in the appropriate circuit court to collect any unpaid administrative penalty, and for attorney's fees and costs incurred directly in the collection thereof.\n\n3. An administrative penalty shall not be increased in those instances where department action, or failure to act, has caused a continuation of the violation that was a basis for the penalty. Any administrative penalty must be assessed within two years following the department's initial discovery of such alleged violation, or from the date the department in the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered such alleged violation.\n\n4. Any final order imposing an administrative penalty is subject to judicial review upon the filing of a petition pursuant to section 536.100 by any person subject to the administrative penalty.\n\n5. The state may elect to assess an administrative penalty, or, in lieu thereof, to request that the attorney general or prosecutor file an appropriate legal action seeking a civil penalty in the appropriate circuit court.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 45, A.L. 1992 S.B. 544, A.L. 1993 S.B. 80, et al.)",

If the commission or the director finds that a generalized condition of the ambient air due to meteorological conditions and a buildup of air contaminants in any portion of this state constitutes or may constitute an emergency risk to the public health, safety or welfare of those in the area, the commission or the director shall declare that an emergency exists and may, with the written approval of the governor, by order prohibit, restrict or condition all sources of air contaminants contributing to the emergency condition during such periods of time necessary to alleviate or lessen the effects of the emergency condition. The commission shall adopt rules and regulations to implement this subsection. Orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall be enforced by the commission and the state and local police and local air conservation enforcement personnel.

If such person, notwithstanding such order, continues the activity or discharge of such contaminants into the atmosphere, the commission or the director shall cause to be filed by the attorney general or other counsel in the name of this state, suit for a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent injunction.

Any constitutional or special charter county or city and any first or second class county or city may apply to the commission for a certificate of authority to operate its own permit and variance program within the boundaries of such county or city. The commission may grant such certificate, after public hearing, if it determines that such action advances the policy of sections 643.010 to 643.190.

For each discipline, the refresher course shall review and discuss current federal and state statute and rule developments, state-of-the-art procedures and key aspects of the initial training course, as determined by the state of Missouri. For all categories except inspectors, individuals shall complete a one-day annual refresher training course for recertification. Refresher courses for inspectors shall be at least a half-day in length. Management planners shall attend the inspector refresher course, plus an additional half-day on management planning. All refresher courses shall require an individual to successfully pass an examination upon completion of the course. In the case of significant changes in Missouri state asbestos statutes or rules, an individual shall also be required to take and successfully pass an updated Missouri state asbestos examination.

If an individual has not successfully completed the annual refresher course within twelve months of the expiration of his or her certification, the individual shall be required to retake the course in his or her specialty area as described in this section. Failure to comply with the requirements for renewal of certification in this section will result in decertification. In no event shall certification or recertification constitute permission to violate sections 643.225 to 643.250 or any standard or rule promulgated under sections 643.225 to 643.250.\n\n6.

Beginning September 1, 2007, emissions inspections required by sections 643.300 to 643.355 shall be conducted through a decentralized emissions program that meets the requirements of this section. Prior to September 1, 2007, the air conservation commission shall develop a decentralized emissions inspection program that allows official inspection stations to conduct on-board diagnostic emission inspections of 1996 model year and newer motor vehicles equipped with on-board diagnostic systems meeting the federal Environmental Protection Agency On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) standards. The decentralized emissions inspection program shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:\n\n(1) The periodic inspection of certain motor vehicles as required under section 643.315;\n\n(2) The certification and operation of official emissions inspection stations and the licensing of emission inspectors;\n\n(3) The testing of motor vehicles through on-board diagnostic testing technologies;\n\n(4) The training, certification, and supervision of emission inspectors and other personnel; and\n\n(5) Procedures for certifying test results and for reporting and maintaining relevant data records.\n\n2. In addition to any other criteria established by the commission under section 643.320 or by rule, the decentralized emissions inspection program shall allow any official inspection station located in an area described in subsection 1 of section 643.305 otherwise qualified by the Missouri state highway patrol to conduct motor vehicle safety inspections under section 307.360 to conduct on-board diagnostic emission inspections. Any motor vehicle safety inspection station that desires to conduct emissions inspections shall submit an application for a certificate of authorization to the commission as provided for under section 643.320. Other individuals, corporations, or entities that do not conduct motor vehicle safety inspections may conduct emission inspections provided they meet the qualifications set forth in sections 643.300 to 643.355 and the rules promulgated by the commission. Applications shall be made upon a form designated by the commission and shall contain such information as may be required by the commission. A certificate of authorization issued under section 643.320 to conduct emission inspections shall be issued only after the commission has made a determination that the applicant's proposed inspection station will be properly equipped, has the necessary licensed emission inspectors to conduct inspections, and meets all other requirements of sections 643.300 to 643.355 or rules promulgated to carry out the provisions of those sections.\n\n3. The decentralized emissions inspection program shall allow any official inspection station that is certified to conduct an on-board diagnostic emission inspection under sections 643.300 to 643.355 to repair motor vehicles in order to bring such vehicles into compliance with sections 643.300 to 643.355, if such station and personnel meet the qualifications to conduct emission repairs as set forth in sections 643.300 to 643.355. An official emission inspection station may elect to be an emissions test-only station or may elect to conduct both emission inspections and repairs.\n\n4. The commission is authorized to begin certification of official inspection stations prior to September 1, 2007, in order to implement the decentralized emissions inspection program. Prior to January 1, 2007, the department of natural resources shall issue a report to the general assembly and the governor regarding the progress of implementing the decentralized emissions inspection program. The report shall include, but not be limited to, a summary describing how many inspection stations or individuals the department expects to participate in the program and how many inspection stations or individuals will be qualified by September 1, 2007, to conduct such emissions inspections.\n\n5. The commission may, as a part of implementing the decentralized emissions inspection program, use remote sensing devices to collect information regarding the vehicle fleet emissions characteristics and registration compliance within the area described in subsection 1 of section 643.305. The decentralized emissions inspection program established by the commission may also include a clean screen program that utilizes remote sensing devices. Owners of eligible vehicles who comply with clean screen/remote sensing procedures shall be deemed to have complied with the mandatory inspection requirements for the next inspection cycle. As used in this subsection, the term\"clean screen program\"shall mean a procedure or system that utilizes remote sensing technologies to determine whether a motor vehicle has acceptable emission levels and then allows the motor vehicle owner to bypass the emissions inspection test required under section 643.315.\n\n6. The decentralized emissions inspection program may include a gas cap pressure test and a visual inspection component, and such tests may be included as part of the motor vehicle safety inspection test under section 307.350.\n\n7. As used in sections 643.300 to 643.355,\"decentralized emissions inspection program\"means an emissions inspection program under which a certified emissions inspector conducts emissions inspection testing at an official inspection station.\n\n8. The decentralized emission inspection program shall satisfy the requirements established by regulation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n9. The decentralized emissions inspection program established by the commission and sections 643.300 to 643.355 shall not be construed to be a new program as described in section 23.253, and the decentralized emissions inspection program shall not be subject to the sunset mandate prescribed by sections 23.250 to 23.298.\n\n10. No later than July 1, 2007, the department of natural resources and the Missouri highway patrol shall enter into an interagency agreement covering all aspects of the administration and enforcement of sections 643.300 to 643.355.\n\n11. No later than July 1, 2007, the air conservation commission shall promulgate rules for the implementation of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2006, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12. Prior to September 1, 2007, the department of natural resources shall actively promote participation in the decentralized emissions inspection program among qualified motor vehicle dealers, service stations, and other individuals. After the implementation of the decentralized emission inspection program, the department shall monitor participation in such program. In determining whether there are a sufficient number of individuals conducting motor vehicle emission inspections under the decentralized program, the department shall attempt to ensure, through promotional efforts, that no more than twenty percent of all persons residing in the affected nonattainment area reside farther than five miles from the nearest inspection station.\n\n(L. 2006 S.B. 583)",

The suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority shall be in writing to the operator, inspector, or the person in charge of the emissions inspection station. Before suspending or revoking the certificate of authority to conduct emissions inspections, the commission or its designee shall serve notice in writing by certified mail or by personal service to the inspection station at the operator's address of record giving the permittee the opportunity to appear in the office of the commission on a stated date, not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the mailing or service of the notice, for a hearing to show cause why the inspection station's certificate of authority should not be suspended or revoked. An inspection station owner or an inspector may appear in person or by counsel in the office of the commission or its designee to show cause why the proposed suspension or revocation is in error, or to present any other facts or testimony that would bear on the final decision of the commission or its designee. If the operator, owner, or inspector does not appear on the stated day after receipt of notice, it shall be presumed that such party admits the allegations of fact contained in the hearing notification letter. The decision of the commission or its designee may in such case be based upon the written reports submitted by the commission's officers.

The department may require emissions inspection stations to furnish reports, upon forms furnished by the department for that purpose, that the department considers necessary for the administration of sections 643.300 to 643.355.\n\n5. The commission may impose alternative administrative enforcement mechanisms in lieu of suspending or revoking a certificate of authority. Such alternative administrative enforcement mechanisms may include, but not be limited to, requiring inspectors to successfully complete a commission-approved retraining program. The commission also may require any individual who has his or her certificate of authority suspended to undergo remedial retraining as a condition of removing such suspension.\n\n6. The commission shall design and furnish each official emissions inspection station, at no cost, one official sign made of metal or other durable material to be displayed in a conspicuous location to designate the station as an official emissions inspection station. Additional signs may be obtained by an official inspection station for a fee equal to the cost to the state. Each official emissions inspection station shall also be supplied with one or more posters which must be displayed in a conspicuous location at the place of inspection and which informs the public that required repairs or corrections need not be made at the inspection station.\n\n(L. 1994 S.B. 590, A.L. 2006 S.B. 583, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1402)",

Compact entered into. —The Kansas-Missouri Air Quality Compact is hereby entered into and enacted into law with the state of Kansas, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nKANSAS-MISSOURI AIR QUALITY COMPACT\n\nARTICLE I. SHORT TITLE\n\n1.1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the Kansas-Missouri Air Quality Compact.\n\nARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS\n\n2.1.\"Signatory state\"shall mean a state party to this compact.\n\n2.2.\"Air pollution\"shall mean the presence in the ambient air of one or more air contaminants in quantities, of characteristics and of a duration which directly and proximately cause or contribute to injury to human, animal or plant life or health or to property or which unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or use of property.\n\n2.3.\"Air contaminant\"shall mean any particulate matter or any gas or vapor or any combination thereof.\n\n2.4.\"Air contaminant source\"shall mean any and all sources of emission of air contaminants whether privately or publicly owned or operated.\n\n2.5.\"Person\"shall mean any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, public or private corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, political subdivision, or any governmental agency, board, department or bureau, or any other legal entity whatever which is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties.\n\nARTICLE III. PURPOSES\n\n3.1. Ambient air is not confined by the common boundary between Kansas and Missouri and is affected with a local, state and regional interest. The planning, conservation, and control of the quality of ambient air are public purposes of the respective signatory states.\n\nThe air resources of the area subject to the jurisdiction of the commission are common to Kansas and Missouri, and the uses of these resources are interdependent. A single agency is therefore essential for effective and economical direction, supervision and coordination of efforts and programs of federal, state and local governments and of private enterprise.\n\nThe signatory states recognize that the discharge into the ambient air of air contaminants so as to cause or contribute to air pollution is contrary to public policy; that air contaminants originating in one state may contribute to the degradation of air quality in the other; and that such degradation may present a hazard to the health, welfare and enjoyment of life and property of the people of both states. It is the purpose of the signatory states, by achieving uniform application of air pollution control regulations, to maintain purity of the common air resources, to protect the health, general welfare and physical property of the people, and to foster maximum employment and full industrial development of the state. Each state, and the commission hereinafter created, shall seek the accomplishment of these objectives through the prevention, abatement and control of air pollution by all practical and economically feasible methods.\n\nARTICLE IV. COMMISSION\n\n4.1.Commission created.There is hereby created the Kansas-Missouri Air Quality Commission, herein called \"the commission\", with the powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the signatory states. The commission shall be a body corporate, with succession for the duration of this compact, as an agency and instrumentality of the governments of the respective signatory states. The commission shall have jurisdiction hereunder with respect to air contaminant sources located in the district comprising the following counties of Missouri and Kansas: Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte of Missouri; and Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte of Kansas. The commission shall have the power to cooperate with federal, state and local agencies with respect to air pollution control matters which affect the air quality standards within the jurisdiction of the commission.\n\n4.2.Membership.The commission shall consist of eleven members, one commissioner representing the appropriate federal agency having jurisdiction of air pollution matters, five commissioners from Kansas and five from Missouri, each of whom shall be a resident of such state, and at least three commissioners from each state shall be residents of the region subject to the jurisdiction of the commission hereunder. The commissioners from each state shall be qualified, chosen and appointed by each state in the manner and for the terms as provided by the laws of the respective states. Vacancies on the commission shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as appointments to full terms.\n\n4.3.Voting.Each commissioner representing a signatory state shall be entitled to a vote, but the commissioner representing the federal government shall vote only as hereinafter provided. All final actions of the commission shall be taken at meetings at which a majority of the members of the commission are present in person. All final actions of the commission shall require a favorable majority vote of the commissioners present. If an unresolved tie vote shall result on any matter properly before the commission, then the commissioner representing the federal government may cast the deciding vote on such matter if present at the meeting, and such vote, if cast, shall decide the matter.\n\n4.4.Compensation.Members of the commission representing the signatory states may receive a per diem allowance as determined and paid by the legislatures of the respective signatory states. Members of the commission shall be reimbursed by the commission for necessary and actual expenses incurred in and incident to the performance of their duties.\n\n4.5.Capacity.The commission shall have all corporate powers essential to the declared objects and purposes of the commission, and it may sue and be sued, enter into contracts and shall have a seal. The commission shall designate a resident agent in each signatory state to accept any service of process made upon the commission, and the names of such agents shall be filed with the secretary of state of each signatory state. The commission may retain counsel to represent it in any action at law brought by or against the commission.\n\n4.6.Officers.The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman and vice chairman. The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, who shall act as secretary, and who, together with such other commission personnel as the commission may determine, shall be bonded in such amount or amounts as the commission may require.\n\n4.7.Personnel.Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit systems laws of any of the signatory states, the commission shall fix the compensation of such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the commission's functions. The executive director shall appoint, remove, and discharge the other officers and employees under such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.\n\n4.8.Retirement.The commission may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the signatory states, a suitable retirement system for its employees. Employees of the commission shall be eligible for Social Security coverage in respect to old age and survivors insurance, provided that the commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The commission may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.\n\n4.9.Assistance.The commission may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel and other services or materials from any state, the United States or any subdivision or agency of either, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.\n\n4.10.Donations.The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services conditional or otherwise, from the United States, or any agency thereof, from any state or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. The identity of any donor, the amount and character of any assistance, and the conditions, if any, attached thereto shall be set forth in the annual report of the commission.\n\n4.11.Facilities.The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, insure, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.\n\n4.12.Bylaws.The commission shall adopt, amend, and rescind bylaws and procedural rules for the conduct of its business.\n\n4.13.Reports.The commission annually shall make to the chief executive, officials and legislative bodies of the signatory states, and to the public, a report on its programs, operations and finances. The commission may issue such additional public reports as it may deem desirable.\n\n4.14.Information.The commission shall have the authority to collect and disseminate information.\n\n4.15.Public records.All actions of the commission shall be taken at public meetings, at which the vote of each commissioner is recorded, and minutes of the commission shall be a public report open to inspection at its offices during regular hours except those portions of any hearing or minutes which concern confidential information as provided for under Article VIII of this compact.\n\nARTICLE V. POWERS AND DUTIES OF COMMISSION\n\n5.1.General powers.Except as otherwise specifically provided in this compact, the commission shall have power to\n\n(a) Adopt, amend and repeal rules and regulations implementing and consistent with this compact.\n\n(b) Hold hearings relating to any aspect of or matter in the administration of this compact, and in connection therewith, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence.\n\n(c) Issue such orders as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this compact and enforce the same by all appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings.\n\n(d) Require access to records relating to emissions which cause or contribute to air pollution.\n\n(e) Secure necessary scientific, technical, administrative and operational services, including laboratory facilities, by contract or otherwise.\n\n(f) Prepare and develop a comprehensive plan or plans for the prevention, abatement and control of air pollution.\n\n(g) Encourage voluntary cooperation by persons and affected groups to achieve the purposes of this compact.\n\n(h) Encourage state and local units of government to handle air pollution problems on a cooperative basis, and provide technical and consultative assistance therefor.\n\n(i) Encourage and conduct studies, investigations and research relating to air contamination and air pollution and their causes, effects, prevention, abatement and control.\n\n(j) Determine by means of field studies and sampling the degree of air contamination and air pollution in any place.\n\n(k) Make a continuing study of the effects of the emission of air contaminants from motor vehicles on the quality of the outdoor atmosphere and make recommendations to appropriate public and private bodies with respect thereto.\n\n(l) After hearing, establish ambient air quality standards for the entire area subject to the commission's jurisdiction or for any part thereof.\n\n(m) Collect and disseminate information and conduct educational and training programs relating to air contamination and air pollution.\n\n(n) Advise, consult, contract and cooperate with other agencies of the state, local governments, industries, other states, interstate or interlocal agencies, and the federal government, and with interested persons or groups.\n\n(o) Consult, upon request, with any person proposing to construct, install, or otherwise acquire an air contaminant source or device or system for the control thereof, concerning the efficacy of such device or system, or the air pollution problem which may be related to the source, device or system. Nothing in any such consultation shall be construed to relieve any person from compliance with this compact, rules or regulations in force pursuant thereto, or any other provision of law.\n\n5.2.Classification and reporting.The commission may, by rule or regulation, classify air contaminant sources which may cause or contribute to air pollution, according to levels and types of emissions and other characteristics which relate to air pollution, and require reporting for any such class or classes. Classifications made pursuant to this subsection may be for application to the entire area subject to the commission's jurisdiction, or to any designated portion thereof, and may be made with special reference to effects on health, economic and land use factors, and physical effects of property; provided, that all such classification shall be made in accordance with the purposes of this compact, as set forth in Article III hereof. Any person operating or responsible for the operation of an air contaminant source of any class for which the rules and regulations of the commission require reporting shall make reports containing information as may be required concerning location, size and height of contaminant outlets, processes employed, fuels used and the nature and time periods or duration of emissions, and such other information as is relevant to air pollution and available or reasonably capable of being assembled.\n\n5.3.New installations.\n\n(a) The commission may require that notice be given to it prior to the undertaking of the construction, installation or establishment of particular types or classes of new air contaminant sources specified in its rules and regulations.\n\n(b) The commission may require the submission of plans, specifications and such other information as it deems necessary in order to determine the cumulative effect of such air contaminant source on the air quality standards within the area of its jurisdiction.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this compact, addition to or enlargement or replacement of an air contaminant source, or any major alteration therein, shall be construed as construction, installation or establishment of a new air contaminant source.\n\n(d) The absence or failure to issue a rule, regulation or order pursuant to this section shall not relieve any person from compliance with any emission standards or with any other provision of law.\n\n5.4.Inspections.Any duly authorized officer, employee, or representative of the commission may enter and inspect any property, premise or place on or at which an air contaminant source is located at any reasonable time for the purpose of ascertaining the state of compliance with this compact and rules and regulations in force pursuant thereto. A suitably restricted search warrant, upon a showing of probable cause in writing and upon oath, may be issued by a court specified in section 6.6(a) of this compact to any such officer, employee, or representative for the purpose of enabling him to make such inspections. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative of the commission who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such inspection. If requested, the owner or operator of the premises shall receive a report setting forth all facts found which relate to compliance status.\n\n5.5.Emission standards.\n\n(a) After hearing in accordance with section 6.3 of this compact, the commission may, by rule or regulation, establish emission standards for any area within the commission's jurisdiction, consistent with the purposes of this compact as provided in Article III hereof. Such emission standards may be for the entire area subject to the commission's jurisdiction, or may vary from area to area dependent upon land use and other varying local conditions, as may be appropriate to facilitate accomplishment of the purposes of this compact.\n\n(b) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to authorize the commission to require by rule, regulation or otherwise the kind or composition of materials or fuels, the type, manufacturer or nature of control devices or other equipment or processes to be used or employed by the owner or operator of any new or existing air contaminant source. Nothing in this compact shall be construed as limiting the power of the commission to establish general variances from required emission standards, as provided in subsection (f) of section 5.7 of this compact.\n\n5.6.Enforcement.\n\n(a) Whenever the executive director has reason to believe that a violation of any provision of this compact, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, has occurred, he may cause written notice to be served upon the alleged violator or violators and upon the state air pollution control agency of the state in which the alleged source is located. The notice shall specify the provision of this compact or rule or regulation alleged to be violated, and the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof, and may include an order that necessary corrective action be taken within a reasonable time. Any such order shall become final unless, no later than ten days after the date the notice and order are served, the person or persons named therein request in writing a hearing before the commission. Upon such request, the commission shall hold a hearing in accordance with the provisions of section 6.4 of this compact. In lieu of an order, the executive director may require that the alleged violator or violators appear before the commission for a hearing, at a time and place specified in the notice, and answer the charges complained of.\n\n(b) If, after a hearing held pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the commission finds that a violation or violations have occurred, it may affirm or modify the order of the executive director previously issued, or issue an appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement or control of the emissions involved or for the taking of such other corrective action as may be appropriate or it may retain jurisdiction, but defer final action to permit the state air pollution control agency to effect a satisfactory remedy. If, after hearing on an order contained in a notice, the commission finds that no violation has occurred or is occurring, it shall rescind the order. Any order issued as part of a notice or after hearing may prescribe the date or dates by which the violation or violations shall cease and may prescribe timetables for necessary action in preventing, abating or controlling the emissions.\n\n(c) Nothing in this compact shall prevent the commission from making efforts to obtain voluntary compliance through warning, conference or any other appropriate means.\n\n5.7.Variances.\n\n(a) Any person who owns or is in control of any air contaminant source may apply to the commission for a variance from rules or regulations by filing an application with the executive director. The executive director shall promptly investigate the application and make a recommendation to the commission as to the disposition thereof. If the recommendation is against the granting of a variance, a public hearing shall be held, if requested by the applicant, in accordance with the provisions of section 6.4 of this compact. If the recommendation is for the granting of the variance, the commission may do so without a public hearing, except that, at the written request of any person aggrieved by the emissions resulting from the granting of the variance, a public hearing shall be held. In any hearing under this section, however, the burden of proof shall be on the person petitioning for a variance. After a hearing, the commission may grant a variance if it finds that:\n\n1. The emissions occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger human health or safety; or\n\n2. Compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public; or\n\n3. Such variance should be granted to effectuate the purposes of this compact as set out in Article III hereof.\n\n(b) No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section until the commission has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property likely to be affected by the emissions, and the general public.\n\n(c) Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of subsection (a) and for time periods and under conditions that shall be specified by the commission in its order granting such variance.\n\n(d) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed, on application, on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint is made to the commission on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted, unless following public hearing on the complaint on due notice the commission finds that renewal is justified. Any application for renewal shall be made at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the variance.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of this compact.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the commission may, after a hearing in accordance with the provisions of section 6.3 of this compact, establish by rule or regulation variances from required emission standards which are uniformly applicable to specific types of air contaminant sources or to particular geographic areas within the commission's jurisdiction.\n\n5.8.Emergency.\n\n(a) Any other provisions of this compact notwithstanding, the commission may adopt rules or regulations authorizing the executive director to order persons causing or contributing to air pollution to reduce or discontinue immediately the emission of air contaminants when he finds that a generalized or specific condition of air pollution exists in any area subject to the jurisdiction of this commission and that in his opinion such condition creates an emergency requiring immediate action to protect human health or safety in such area.\n\n(b) Upon issuance of any such order the commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing to be held before the commission not later than forty-eight hours after the issuance of the order to investigate and determine the factors causing or contributing to the emergency conditions. All persons whose interests are prejudiced or affected in any manner by any such order shall have the right to appear in person or by counsel at the hearing and to present evidence relevant to the subject of the hearings. Within twenty-four hours after completion of the hearing, the commission shall affirm, modify or set aside the order or make such other orders as the commission deems appropriate under the circumstances in accordance and consistent with the evidence adduced and shall notify all persons appearing in person or by counsel of its determination in writing by certified or registered mail.\n\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any power of the President of the United States or the governor of either signatory state, or any other officer of either state, or the United States, to act in the event of an emergency.\n\nARTICLE VI. HEARING AND REVIEW\n\n6.1.Public hearings.All hearings held by the commission shall be open to the public. All testimony taken before the commission shall be under oath and recorded in a written transcript. The transcript so recorded shall be made available to any member of the public or to any participant in such hearing upon payment of reasonable charges therefor as fixed by the commission.\n\n6.2.Powers of hearing officer.All hearings shall be had before one or more members of the commission, or before an officer or employee of the commission expressly designated thereby to act as a hearing officer. Any person conducting the hearing, and the executive director, may issue in the name of the commission notices of hearings and subpoenas requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses and production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such, and administer oaths and affirmations and examine witnesses.\n\n6.3.Rules and regulations.The commission shall not adopt any rules or regulations, other than those relating to its internal organization, unless and until it has held a public hearing thereon, at which any person shall be entitled to appear and offer testimony with or without counsel. Notice of said hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each county within the jurisdiction of the commission at least thirty days prior to such hearing, and shall be mailed to the air pollution control agencies of the signatory states. All rules and regulations so adopted by the commission shall be filed in the manner provided for by law for filing administrative rules in each of the signatory states and such rules and regulations shall not become effective until ten days after such filing.\n\n6.4.Adversary hearings.\n\n(a) At any hearing on an order directed to a specific person or persons, or a specific source of air contaminants, or on application for variance or renewal or revocation thereof, those persons, or the owner or operator of such source, or the applicant, shall be entitled to be a party to the proceedings, and the air pollution control agencies of the signatory states shall also be entitled to be parties. Any party shall be entitled to at least twenty days notice of such hearing by registered mail, and such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the alleged air contaminant source is located, and sent by ordinary mail to any person who has in writing requested notice. Any party shall be entitled to appear in person or by representative, with or without counsel, and make oral or written argument, offer testimony, cross-examine witnesses, or take any combination of such actions with respect to any matter in issue including the validity under this compact of any commission order, rule, regulation or standard as it may affect such party. Any person aggrieved by the emissions from the alleged air contaminant source shall be entitled to appear and to testify with respect to the matter in controversy, subject to such restrictions and procedures as the commission may establish, but shall not be a party to such proceeding.\n\n(b) In any adversary proceeding each party shall be entitled to present oral arguments or written briefs at or after the hearing, which shall be heard or read by each commissioner who renders or joins in rendering the order of the commission.\n\n(c) In each adversary proceeding each commissioner who renders or joins in rendering the order of the commission shall, prior to taking final action thereon, either hear all the evidence, read the full record including all the evidence, or personally consider the portions of the record cited or referred to in the arguments or briefs. The parties to such adversary proceeding may by written stipulation or by oral stipulation in the record at the hearing waive compliance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(d) Every order by the commission in an adversary proceeding shall be in writing and shall include or be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings of fact shall be stated separately from the conclusions of law and shall include a concise statement of the findings on which the commission bases its order.\n\n6.5.Refusal to obey subpoena.In case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued in the name of the commission, any United States district court, district court of Kansas or circuit court of Missouri having jurisdiction may issue, upon the application of the person conducting the hearing, an order requiring attendance or production of evidence as the case may require. Any failure to obey an order may be punished by the court as contempt thereof. Subpoenas shall be served as provided by the law of the state in which they are served.\n\n6.6.Judicial enforcement and review.\n\n(a) It shall be the duty of any person to comply with any final order issued against him by the commission in accordance with section 5.6 of this compact. In a signatory state, any court of general jurisdiction in any county in which the alleged air contaminant source is located, or any United States district court for the district in which the alleged air contaminant source is located, shall entertain and determine any action or proceeding brought by the commission to enforce an abatement order against the owner or operator of such air contaminant source. In any action to enforce or review such an order, the court may affirm, modify or reverse the order and may issue its decree enforcing the order as affirmed or modified.\n\n(b) Any party to a hearing held under this compact who is aggrieved by any order made by the commission shall be entitled to a judicial review thereof. Such review may be had by filing a verified petition in any of the appropriate courts designated in subsection (a) of this section setting out such order and alleging specifically wherein said order is:\n\n1. Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n\n2. Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity.\n\n3. In excess of authority or jurisdiction conferred by this compact or statutes in implementation hereof.\n\n4. Without observance of procedure required by law.\n\n5. Unsupported by substantial evidence.­­The petition for review shall be filed within thirty days after receipt of written notice that such order has been issued. Written notice of the filing of such petition for review and a copy of said petition shall be personally served upon the commission. Within fifteen days after filing the petition, the petitioner shall secure from the commission a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing or hearings held in connection with the issuance of the order, the review of which is sought, and file the same with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding for review is pending. An extension of time in which to file such transcript may be granted by the court for good cause shown. Inability to obtain the transcript within the specified time shall be good cause. Failure to file the transcript within fifteen days, or to secure an extension of time therefor, shall be cause for the dismissal of the petition. Where more than one party may be aggrieved by the order only one proceeding for review may be had, and the court in which a petition for review is first properly filed shall have jurisdiction.\n\n­­The petition for review shall be filed within thirty days after receipt of written notice that such order has been issued. Written notice of the filing of such petition for review and a copy of said petition shall be personally served upon the commission.

Emission standards to be developed for certain carbon dioxide sources — unit-by-unit analysis required, procedure — severability clause. —1. The commission shall develop emission standards under 42 U.S.C. Section 7411(d) and 40 CFR 60.24 through a unit-by-unit analysis of each existing affected source of carbon dioxide within the state. As used in this section,\"unit-by-unit analysis\"means an analysis of each generation plant individually, regardless of the number of turbines at each plant site.\n\n2. The commission shall consider in developing and implementing emission standards for each existing affected source of carbon dioxide, among other factors, the remaining useful life of the existing affected source to which such standard applies, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Section 7411(d).\n\n3. The commission shall consider, consistent with its statutory duties to achieve the prevention, abatement, and control of air pollution by all commercially available and economically feasible methods, the overall economic impact from any and all emission standards and compliance schedules developed and implemented under 42 U.S.C. Section 7411(d).\n\n4. The commission may develop, on a unit-by-unit basis for individual existing affected sources and emissions of carbon dioxide at these existing affected sources, consistent with 40 CFR 60.24(f), emission standards that are less stringent, but not more stringent, than applicable federal emission guidelines or longer compliance schedules than those required by federal regulations. This determination shall be based on:\n\n(1) Unreasonable cost of control resulting from plant age, location, or basic process design;\n\n(2) Physical impossibility of installing necessary control equipment; or\n\n(3) Other factors specific to the existing affected source or class of existing affected sources that make application of a less-stringent standard or final compliance time significantly more reasonable, including, but not limited to, the absolute cost of applying the emission standard and compliance schedule to the existing affected source; the outstanding debt associated with the existing affected source; the economic impacts of closing the existing affected source, including expected job losses if the existing affected source is unable to comply with the performance standard; and the customer impacts of applying the emission standard and compliance schedule to the existing affected source, including any disproportionate electric rate impacts on low-income populations.\n\n5. As required by 40 CFR 60.26, the commission has legal authority to carry out any state implementation plan with emission standards and compliance schedules that are developed and implemented consistent with this chapter.\n\n6. If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.\n\n(L. 2014 H.B. 1631 merged with S.B. 664)",

Any owner of a coal-fired electric generating source in a National Ambient Air Quality Standards nonattainment area currently designated as of April 1, 2015, shall develop an ambient air quality monitoring or modeling network to characterize the sulfur dioxide air quality surrounding the electric generating source. The network shall adequately monitor the ambient air quality for sulfur dioxide surrounding the entire electric generating source and shall operate for not less than twelve consecutive quarters. The owner of such electric generating source shall notify the department of the manner in which it intends to characterize by either modeling or monitoring the air quality around such source. The location of any monitoring network installed by the owner of such electric generating source within a one-hour sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards nonattainment area shall be approved by the department.\n\n2. Affected sources located in undesignated areas that elect to use monitoring to evaluate ambient air quality shall be consulted by the department on the use of existing monitors as well as the location of any new monitors intended to comprise the sulfur dioxide monitoring network. The department shall not submit its recommendation to the Environmental Protection Agency on the manner in which data will be gathered for the designation process that is inconsistent with the elections made by affected sources under this section. Where affected sources have elected to monitor under this section, the department shall submit recommendations for the designation process by the date set by a final, effective, and applicable Environmental Protection Agency requirement relating to state attainment designations and not prior.\n\n3. The department shall consider all ambient air quality monitoring network data collected under subsection 1 of this section and under any agreement authorized under this subsection prior to proposing to the commission any sulfur dioxide limitation, emission reduction requirement, or other requirement for purposes of the one-hour sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard for any electric generating source that has elected to install a monitoring network under this section, except:\n\n(1) The department may propose to the commission any sulfur dioxide limitations or emission reduction requirements specifically agreed to in any voluntary agreement entered into between the department and any owner of an electric generating source that has elected to install a monitoring network under this section; and\n\n(2) The department may propose to the commission any adjustments to the sulfur dioxide limitations or emission reduction requirements applicable to any electric generating source located in a sulfur dioxide nonattainment area and subject to an agreement under subdivision (1) of this subsection, as justified by an ambient air quality analysis relying on no fewer than two quarters of monitored data collected through the monitoring network allowable under subsection 1 of this section and consistent with such agreement.\n\n4. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from entering into an agreement with an owner of an electric generating source to limit or reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at such affected source that is below the source's permitted sulfur dioxide emission rate.\n\n(L. 2015 H.B. 92 merged with S.B. 445)",
