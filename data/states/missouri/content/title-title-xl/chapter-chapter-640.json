Unified permit schedule authorized for activities requiring multiple permits — director's duties — procedure — rulemaking authority. —1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for activities that may require multiple environmental state permits or certifications, an applicant may directly petition the director for purposes of approving or denying such permits or certifications, and for purposes of coordinating a unified permit schedule with the department which covers the timing and order to obtain such permits in a coordinated and streamlined process. In determining the schedule, the department and applicant shall consider which permits are most critical for the regulated activity, the need for unified public participation for all of the regulated aspects of the permitted activity, the applicant's anticipated staging of construction and financing for the permitted activity, and the applicant's use of innovative environmental approaches or strategies to minimize its environmental impacts.\n\n2. In order to facilitate a unified and streamlined permitting process, the director shall develop and implement a process to coordinate the processing of multiple environmental permits, certifications, or permit modifications from a single applicant.\n\n3. The department may initiate the unified permits process for a class of similar activities by notifying any known applicants interested in those regulated activities of the intent to use the unified process. To the extent practicable and consistent with the purposes of this section, the department shall coordinate with interested applicants on the unified permit schedule.\n\n4. The process developed and implemented by the director shall include working with such applicants in an effort to help determine, at the earliest stage, all of the permits required for a specific proposed activity based on information provided by the applicant; additional information regarding the proposed activity may result in different permits being required. The department shall inform applicants that a unified permitting schedule is available. Any multiple-permit applicant may decline at any time to have its permits processed in accordance with the schedule and instead proceed on a permit-by-permit approach. The department shall publicize the order and tentative schedule on the department's internet website.\n\n5. Following the establishment of a unified permit schedule, the director shall notify the applicant in writing of the order in which the applicant shall obtain permits. The department shall proceed to consider applications accordingly and may only modify the schedule with the consent of the applicant through the date of the public hearing. Each application shall be reviewed by the department based solely on its own merits and compliance with the applicable law.\n\n6. The department shall coordinate with the applicant, to the extent possible, to align the unified permit process so that all public meetings or hearings related to the permits are consolidated into one hearing in a location near the facility.\n\n7. In furtherance of this section, the director may waive otherwise applicable procedural requirements related to timing as set forth in state environmental laws or rules found in this chapter and chapters 236, 259, 260, 444, 643, and 644, so long as:\n\n(1) The public comment periods related to each permit are not shortened; and\n\n(2) The unified permitting schedule does not impair the ability of the applicant or the department to comply with substantive legal requirements related to the permit application.\n\n8. The director shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2008, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2008 S.B. 1181, et al., A.L. 2013 H.B. 28 merged with H.B. 650)\n\nEffective 8-28-13 (H.B. 28); 10-11-13 (H.B. 650)\n\n*H.B. 650 effective 10-11-13, see § 21.250.

Each customer of a public water system shall pay an annual fee for each customer service connection.\n\n(2) The annual fee per customer service connection for unmetered customers and customers with meters not greater than one inch in size shall be based upon the number of service connections in the water system serving that customer, and shall not exceed:\n\n(3) The annual user fee for customers having meters greater than one inch but less than or equal to two inches in size shall not exceed seven dollars and forty-four cents; for customers with meters greater than two inches but less than or equal to four inches in size shall not exceed forty-one dollars and sixteen cents; and for customers with meters greater than four inches in size shall not exceed eighty-two dollars and forty-four cents.\n\n(4) Customers served by multiple connections shall pay an annual user fee based on the above rates for each connection, except that no single facility served by multiple connections shall pay a total of more than five hundred dollars per year.\n\n6.

Upon completion of the comprehensive review, the department shall submit a proposed fee structure with stakeholder agreement to the safe drinking water commission. The commission shall review such recommendations at a forthcoming regular or special meeting, but shall not vote on the fee structure until a subsequent meeting. If the commission approves, by vote of two-thirds majority or six of nine commissioners, the fee structure recommendations, the commission shall authorize the department to file a notice of proposed rulemaking containing the recommended fee structure, and after considering public comments may authorize the department to file the final order of rulemaking for such rule with the joint committee on administrative rules pursuant to sections 536.021 and 536.024 no later than December first of the same year. If such rules are not disapproved by the general assembly in the manner set out below, they shall take effect on January first of the following calendar year, at which point the existing fee structure shall expire. Any regulation promulgated under this subsection shall be deemed to be beyond the scope and authority provided in this subsection, or detrimental to permit applicants, if the general assembly within the first sixty calendar days of the regular session immediately following the filing of such regulation disapproves the regulation by concurrent resolution.

In determining the amount of the administrative penalty, the department shall take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the harm which the violation causes or may cause, the violator's previous compliance record, the nature and persistence of the violation, any corrective actions taken, the number of connections served by the system and any other factors which the department may reasonably deem relevant.\n\n3. Any order assessing an administrative penalty shall state that an administrative penalty is being assessed under this section and that the person subject to the penalty may appeal as provided by this section. Any such order which fails to state the law or regulation under which the penalty is being sought, the manner of collection or rights of appeal shall result in the state's waiving any right to collection of the penalty. An administrative penalty shall be paid within sixty days from the date of issuance of the order assessing the penalty. Any person subject to an administrative penalty may appeal to the commission. Any appeal shall stay the due date of such administrative penalty until the appeal is resolved. Any person who fails to pay an administrative penalty by the final due date shall be liable to the state for a surcharge of fifteen percent of the penalty plus ten percent per annum on any amounts owed. Any administrative penalty paid pursuant to this section shall be handled in accordance with Section 7 of Article IX of the Missouri Constitution. An action may be brought in the appropriate circuit court to collect any unpaid administrative penalty, and for attorney's fees and costs incurred directly in the collection thereof.\n\n4. An administrative penalty shall not be increased in those instances where department action, or failure to act, has caused a continuation of the violation that was a basis for the penalty. Any administrative penalty shall be assessed within two years following the department's initial discovery of such alleged violation, or from the date the department in the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered such alleged violation.\n\n5. Any final order imposing an administrative penalty is subject to judicial review upon the filing of a petition pursuant to section 536.100 by any person subject to the administrative penalty. No judicial review shall be available, however, until all administrative remedies are exhausted.\n\n6. The state may elect to assess an administrative penalty, or, in lieu thereof, to request that the attorney general or prosecutor file an appropriate legal action seeking a civil penalty in the appropriate circuit court.\n\n(L. 1998 H.B. 1161)\n\nEffective 6-09-98",

In order to protect the access, use, and enjoyment of Missouri's water resources, it shall be unlawful for any person to export water resources outside the state of Missouri unless such person holds a water exportation permit issued by the department, subject to the following exemptions:\n\n(1) If the withdrawal and end use of water resources are within thirty miles of the border of the state, any person exempt under the provision of this section shall report to the director annually the person's water use volumes and withdrawal rates in a format and timeline determined by the director. Such report shall be made available to the public by the department on the department's website. Such report shall also be provided to the commission; and\n\n(2) Exportation of bottled water, or water packaged in containers intended for single use.\n\n3. It shall be unlawful for any person to withdraw water from any water resource for exportation outside the state of Missouri by use of a pipeline facility, unless the withdrawal and ultimate end use of the water by the pipeline facility is within thirty miles of the state border. Any person who withdraws water for exportation under this subsection shall annually report the water use volumes, withdrawal rates, and end use to the department in a manner and on timelines determined by the department.\n\n4. The director shall review each water exportation permit application and all supporting materials to ensure all the following conditions have been met prior to accepting a water exportation permit application for public comment and review by the commission:\n\n(1) There are water resources available in the volumes and withdrawal rates requested by the applicant for export;\n\n(2) The applicant has demonstrated both a present need and beneficial use for the water resources. In making the determination of need and beneficial use, the director shall consider the availability of all water sources, whether in state or out of state, along with other relevant factors as the director and the commission deem appropriate;\n\n(3) The volume and withdrawal rates requested by the applicant shall not interfere with existing and projected in-state beneficial uses;\n\n(4) The applicant has demonstrated that water in the amounts and rates requested can feasibly be exported to meet its intended beneficial uses;\n\n(5) The applicant has provided relevant information and the director and the commission confirmed that issuance of a water exportation permit is necessary for the beneficial use of the applicant or the applicant's customers, and the beneficial use at the end-use location is not reasonably attainable through a method other than granting a water exportation permit under this section;\n\n(6) In the event of a conflict between the beneficial use outside the state and the beneficial use needs in the state, the director and the commission shall prioritize the beneficial use needs of the state and its citizens over the applicant or other state; and\n\n(7) Whenever a person applies for a water exportation permit or water exportation permit renewal, the department shall send a written notice within thirty business days after receiving the permit application to the county commission of the county where the water for exportation is located.\n\n5. (1) Within one hundred twenty days after the receipt of a complete application, the director shall determine whether the applicant complied with provisions of subsection 4*of this section. The director shall, after making such determination, hold a thirty-day public comment period regarding the director's determination. Within sixty days after the comment period, the director shall recommend approval or denial of the permit. Such recommendation, along with all public comments, shall be submitted to the commission. The commission shall have a public hearing within thirty days after receipt of the director's recommendation. This public hearing may be scheduled during one of the commission's regular scheduled meetings. The commission shall make a final decision to approve or deny the water exportation permit within thirty days after the public hearing. A three-fourths majority of the commission members present shall be required to approve the issuance or renewal of a water exportation permit.\n\n(2) To renew a valid water exportation permit, an applicant shall file a renewal application for a water exportation permit with the department no later than two hundred seventy-one days prior to the expiration of the existing water exportation permit. The applicant, director, and the commission shall follow the same procedures and timelines as required for the issuance of a new water exportation permit under this section. The director may impose additional conditions to address any substantial or material change in factors under subsection 4*of this section or may deny a renewal application as necessary to comply with this section based on any such substantial or material changes in factors under subsection 4*of this section. If the director or the commission are in the process of reviewing the renewal application before the final decision is made and the existing applicant's water exportation permit expires, such applicant shall be able to operate under the terms of the expired water exportation permit until a final decision is made by the commission on the renewal of such permit.\n\n(3) In the absence of an appeal as provided under chapter 536, the decision of the commission shall be final.\n\n6. A water exportation permit shall be in effect for three years from the date of issuance. The permit holder shall annually report the water use volumes, withdrawal rates, and end use to the department in a manner and on timelines determined by the department. Such report shall be made available to the public on the department's website.\n\n7. The water exportation permit application shall include all water exportation requested by the applicant. The water exportation permit may be approved in whole or in part by the director or the commission. This section shall be interpreted to allow one applicant to include multiple water withdrawals for exportation from various locations within one water exportation permit application.\n\n8. A water exportation permit application shall include a designee or agent in the state of Missouri for service of process and to receive other notices.\n\n9. A major water user, as defined in section 256.400, may request the department to reevaluate any existing water exportation permit using the criteria under subsection 4*of this section. The department shall create a mechanism for a major water user to submit a request for reevaluation and shall provide the major water user with the director's findings within one hundred**twenty days of the request for reevaluation. After reevaluating the permit, the director shall impose additional conditions necessary for the continued exportation of water outside the state if the director determines that the existing permit is negatively impacting the requesting major water user's beneficial use of his or her water resources. The director's decision to modify or to decline to modify the conditions in an existing permit pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to approval by the commission.\n\n10. Nothing in this section shall preclude a person from bringing any constitutional, statutory, or common law claim to vindicate or otherwise defend the person's water rights. A permit issued under this section shall not serve as a defense to any claim brought against a water permit holder for the infringement of water rights. In addition, any person harmed by the issuance of a water exportation permit may bring an injunctive action or other appropriate action to enforce the provisions of this section. Suits may be brought in the county where the defendant's principal place of business is located or where the withdrawal of water occurred in violation of this section.\n\n11. If the attorney general receives a complaint that provisions of this section have been violated, or, at the request of the department, the attorney general shall bring an injunctive action or other appropriate action in the name of the people of the state to enforce provisions of this section. Suit may be brought in Cole County, or in any county where the defendant's principal place of business is located or where the withdrawal of water occurred in violation of this section. Any member of the commission deemed to have violated any provision of this section shall forfeit their office upon such finding of a violation.\n\n12. Whenever a state of emergency is declared by the governor under section 44.100 for all or any part of the state, based on drought conditions, the department shall reevaluate any existing water exportation permit. Any reevaluation completed under this section shall use the criteria under subsection 3 of this section. After reevaluation of the permit is complete, the department shall have the authority to impose additional conditions or revoke the permit if necessary for the continued exportation of water outside the state if the director determines that the existing permit negatively impacts beneficial use of water resources. The director's decision to modify, revoke, or make no changes to the permit shall be subject to the approval or denial of the commission.\n\n13. If any provision of subsection 3 of this section or the application thereof to anyone or to any circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of those sections and the application of such provisions to others or other circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n(L. 2025 S.B. 82 §§ 640.406, B)\n\n*Subsection \"3\" appears in original rolls.\n\n**Word \"and\" appears here in original rolls.",
