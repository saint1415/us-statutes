If service cannot be accomplished as described in this section, notice by publication as described in subsection 3 of section 506.160 shall be allowed; any commissioner is authorized to act as a court or judge would in that section, and any employee of the commission is authorized to act as a clerk would in that section. In any case initiated upon complaint of the attorney general, the agency which issued the license shall be given notice of such complaint and the date upon which the hearing will be held by delivery of a copy of such complaint and notice to the office of such agency or by certified mail. Such agency may intervene and may retain the services of legal counsel to represent it in such case.\n\n2.

The default decision shall grant such relief as requested by the division of professional registration, board, committee, commission, or office in the writing initiating the contested case as allowed by law. Upon motion stating facts constituting a meritorious defense and for good cause shown, a default decision may be set aside. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days after entry of the default decision.\"Good cause\"includes a mistake or conduct that is not intentionally or recklessly designed to impede the administrative process.\n\n3.
