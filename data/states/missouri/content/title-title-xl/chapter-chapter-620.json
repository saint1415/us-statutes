If business or employment conditions cause the amount of the new or retained jobs credit from withholding to be less than the amount projected in the agreement for any time period, then other withholding tax paid by the qualified company under sections 143.191 to 143.265 shall be credited to the applicable fund by the amount of such difference. The qualified company shall remit the amount of the new or retained jobs credit, or both, if applicable, to the department of revenue in the manner prescribed in sections 143.191 to 143.265. When all training project costs have been paid, the new or retained jobs credits, or both, if applicable, shall cease;\n\n(3) The community college district participating in a project shall establish a special fund for and in the name of the training project. All funds appropriated by the general assembly from the funds established under this section and disbursed by the department for the training project and other amounts received by the district for training project costs as required by the agreement shall be deposited in the special fund. Amounts held in the special fund shall be used and disbursed by the district only to pay training project costs for such training project. The special fund may be divided into such accounts and subaccounts as shall be provided in the agreement, and amounts held therein may be invested in the same manner as the district's other funds;\n\n(4) Any disbursement for training project costs received from the department under sections 620.800 to 620.809 and deposited into the training project's special fund may be irrevocably pledged by a community college district for the payment of the principal, premium, and interest on the certificate issued by a community college district to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, such training project;\n\n(5) The qualified company shall certify to the department of revenue that the new or retained jobs credit, or both, if applicable, is in accordance with an agreement and shall provide other information the department of revenue may require;\n\n(6) An employee participating in a training project shall receive full credit under section 143.211 for the amount designated as a new or retained jobs credit;\n\n(7) If an agreement provides that all or part of training project costs are to be met by receipt of new or retained jobs credit, or both, if applicable, the provisions of this subsection shall also apply to any successor to the original qualified company until the principal and interest on the certificates have been paid.\n\n9. To provide funds for the present payment of the training project costs through the Missouri one start program as provided in this section, a community college district may borrow money and issue and sell certificates payable from a sufficient portion of the future receipts of payments authorized by the agreement including disbursements from the funds established under this section, to the special fund established by the community college district for each training project. The total amount of outstanding certificates sold by all community college districts shall not exceed the total amount authorized under law as of January 1, 2013. The certificates shall be marketed through financial institutions authorized to do business in Missouri. The receipts shall be pledged to the payment of principal of and interest on the certificates. Certificates may be sold at public sale or at private sale at par, premium, or discount of not less than ninety-five percent of the par value thereof, at the discretion of the board of trustees, and may bear interest at such rate or rates as the board of trustees shall determine, notwithstanding the provisions of section 108.170 to the contrary. However, the provisions of chapter 176 shall not apply to the issuance of such certificates. Certificates may be issued with respect to a single training project or multiple training projects and may contain terms or conditions as the board of trustees may provide by resolution authorizing the issuance of the certificates.\n\n10. Certificates issued to refund other certificates may be sold at public sale or at private sale as provided in this section, with the proceeds from the sale to be used for the payment of the certificates being refunded. The refunding certificates may be exchanged in payment and discharge of the certificates being refunded, in installments at different times or an entire issue or series at one time. Refunding certificates may be sold or exchanged at any time on, before, or after the maturity of the outstanding certificates to be refunded. They may be issued for the purpose of refunding a like, greater, or lesser principal amount of certificates and may bear a rate of interest that is higher, lower, or equivalent to that of the certificates being renewed or refunded.\n\n11. Before certificates are issued, the board of trustees shall publish once a notice of its intention to issue the certificates, stating the amount, the purpose, and the project or projects for which the certificates are to be issued. A person with standing may, within fifteen days after the publication of the notice, by action in the circuit court of a county in the district, appeal the decision of the board of trustees to issue the certificates. The action of the board of trustees in determining to issue the certificates shall be final and conclusive unless the circuit court finds that the board of trustees has exceeded its legal authority. An action shall not be brought which questions the legality of the certificates, the power of the board of trustees to issue the certificates, the effectiveness of any proceedings relating to the authorization of the project, or the authorization and issuance of the certificates from and after fifteen days from the publication of the notice of intention to issue.\n\n12. The board of trustees shall make a finding based on information supplied by the qualified company that revenues provided in the agreement are sufficient to secure the faithful performance of obligations in the agreement.\n\n13. Certificates issued under this section shall not be deemed to be an indebtedness of the state, the community college district, or any other political subdivision of the state, and the principal and interest on any certificates shall be payable only from the sources provided in subdivision (1) of subsection 5 of this section which are pledged in the agreement.\n\n14. Pursuant to section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset act:\n\n(1) The program authorized under sections 620.800 to 620.809 shall be reauthorized as of August 28, 2018, and shall expire on August 28, 2030; and\n\n(2) If such program is reauthorized, the program authorized under sections 620.800 to 620.809 shall automatically sunset twelve years after the effective date of the reauthorization of sections 620.800 to 620.809; and\n\n(3) Sections 620.800 to 620.809 shall terminate on September first of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which a program authorized under sections 620.800 to 620.809 is sunset.\n\n15.

The fund shall consist of all moneys which may be appropriated to it by the general assembly, gifts, contributions, grants or bequests received from federal, private or other sources. A percentage of the moneys in such fund shall be used by the department for grants or loans for qualified community development projects in order to create or retain jobs in any city not within a county, any city with a population of three hundred fifty thousand or more inhabitants which is located in more than one county, any fourth class city with a population of at least three thousand five hundred inhabitants but not more than five thousand five hundred inhabitants which is located in a county of the first classification with a charter form of government with a population of at least nine hundred thousand inhabitants, and any third class city with a population of at least three thousand inhabitants but not more than five thousand five hundred inhabitants which is located in a county of the first classification with a charter form of government with a population of at least nine hundred thousand inhabitants, and shall be targeted toward economically blighted urban districts for new businesses, expansion of existing businesses and for employee training and housing.

      "text": "Title XL ADDITIONAL EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS\n\nChapter 620\n\n620.1881. Project notice of intent, department to respond with a proposal or a rejection — benefits available — effect on withholding tax — projects eligible for benefits — annual report — cap on tax credits — allocation of tax credits. —1. The department of economic development shall respond within thirty days to a company who provides a notice of intent with either an approval or a rejection of the notice of intent. The department shall give preference to qualified companies and projects targeted at an area of the state which has recently been classified as a disaster area by the federal government. Failure to respond on behalf of the department of economic development shall result in the notice of intent being deemed an approval for the purposes of this section. A qualified company who is provided an approval for a project shall be allowed a benefit as provided in this program in the amount and duration provided in this section. A qualified company may receive additional periods for subsequent new jobs at the same facility after the full initial period if the minimum thresholds are met as set forth in sections 620.1875 to 620.1890. There is no limit on the number of periods a qualified company may participate in the program, as long as the minimum thresholds are achieved and the qualified company provides the department with the required reporting and is in proper compliance for this program or other state programs. A qualified company may elect to file a notice of intent to start a new project period concurrent with an existing project period if the minimum thresholds are achieved and the qualified company provides the department with the required reporting and is in proper compliance for this program and other state programs; however, the qualified company may not receive any further benefit under the original approval for jobs created after the date of the new notice of intent, and any jobs created before the new notice of intent may not be included as new jobs for the purpose of benefit calculation in relation to the new approval. When a qualified company has filed and received approval of a notice of intent and subsequently files another notice of intent, the department shall apply the definition of project facility under subdivision (19) of section 620.1878 to the new notice of intent as well as all previously approved notices of intent and shall determine the application of the definitions of new job, new payroll, project facility base employment, and project facility base payroll accordingly.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any qualified company that is awarded benefits under this program may not simultaneously receive tax credits or exemptions under sections 135.100 to 135.150, sections 135.200 to 135.286, section 135.535, or sections 135.900 to 135.906*at the same project facility. The benefits available to the company under any other state programs for which the company is eligible and which utilize withholding tax from the new jobs of the company must first be credited to the other state program before the withholding retention level applicable under the Missouri quality jobs act will begin to accrue. These other state programs include, but are not limited to, the Missouri works**jobs training program under sections 620.800 to 620.809, the real property tax increment allocation redevelopment act, sections 99.800 to 99.865, or the Missouri downtown and rural economic stimulus act under sections 99.915 to 99.980. If any qualified company also participates in the Missouri works**jobs training program in sections 620.800 to 620.809, the company shall retain no withholding tax, but the department shall issue a refundable tax credit for the full amount of benefit allowed under this subdivision. The calendar year annual maximum amount of tax credits which may be issued to a qualifying company that also participates in the new job training program shall be increased by an amount equivalent to the withholding tax retained by that company under the new jobs training program. However, if the combined benefits of the quality jobs program and the new jobs training program exceed the projected state benefit of the project, as determined by the department of economic development through a cost-benefit analysis, the increase in the maximum tax credits shall be limited to the amount that would not cause the combined benefits to exceed the projected state benefit. Any taxpayer who is awarded benefits under this program who knowingly hires individuals who are not allowed to work legally in the United States shall immediately forfeit such benefits and shall repay the state an amount equal to any state tax credits already redeemed and any withholding taxes already retained.\n\n3. The types of projects and the amount of benefits to be provided are:\n\n(1) Small and expanding business projects: in exchange for the consideration provided by the new tax revenues and other economic stimuli that will be generated by the new jobs created by the program, a qualified company may retain an amount equal to the withholding tax as calculated under subdivision (33) of section 620.1878 from the new jobs that would otherwise be withheld and remitted by the qualified company under the provisions of sections 143.191 to 143.265 for a period of three years from the date the required number of new jobs were created if the average wage of the new payroll equals or exceeds the county average wage or for a period of five years from the date the required number of new jobs were created if the average wage of the new payroll equals or exceeds one hundred twenty percent of the county average wage;\n\n(2) Technology business projects: in exchange for the consideration provided by the new tax revenues and other economic stimuli that will be generated by the new jobs created by the program, a qualified company may retain an amount equal to a maximum of five percent of new payroll for a period of five years from the date the required number of jobs were created from the withholding tax of the new jobs that would otherwise be withheld and remitted by the qualified company under the provisions of sections 143.191 to 143.265 if the average wage of the new payroll equals or exceeds the county average wage. An additional one-half percent of new payroll may be added to the five percent maximum if the average wage of the new payroll in any year exceeds one hundred twenty percent of the county average wage in the county in which the project facility is located, plus an additional one-half percent of new payroll may be added if the average wage of the new payroll in any year exceeds one hundred forty percent of the average wage in the county in which the project facility is located. The department shall issue a refundable tax credit for any difference between the amount of benefit allowed under this subdivision and the amount of withholding tax retained by the company, in the event the withholding tax is not sufficient to provide the entire amount of benefit due to the qualified company under this subdivision;\n\n(3) High impact projects: in exchange for the consideration provided by the new tax revenues and other economic stimuli that will be generated by the new jobs created by the program, a qualified company may retain an amount from the withholding tax of the new jobs that would otherwise be withheld and remitted by the qualified company under the provisions of sections 143.191 to 143.265, equal to three percent of new payroll for a period of five years from the date the required number of jobs were created if the average wage of the new payroll equals or exceeds the county average wage of the county in which the project facility is located. For high-impact projects in a facility located within two adjacent counties, the new payroll shall equal or exceed the higher county average wage of the adjacent counties. The percentage of payroll allowed under this subdivision shall be three and one-half percent of new payroll if the average wage of the new payroll in any year exceeds one hundred twenty percent of the county average wage in the county in which the project facility is located. The percentage of payroll allowed under this subdivision shall be four percent of new payroll if the average wage of the new payroll in any year exceeds one hundred forty percent of the county average wage in the county in which the project facility is located. An additional one percent of new payroll may be added to these percentages if local incentives equal between ten percent and twenty-four percent of the new direct local revenue; an additional two percent of new payroll is added to these percentages if the local incentives equal between twenty-five percent and forty-nine percent of the new direct local revenue; or an additional three percent of payroll is added to these percentages if the local incentives equal fifty percent or more of the new direct local revenue. The department shall issue a refundable tax credit for any difference between the amount of benefit allowed under this subdivision and the amount of withholding tax retained by the company, in the event the withholding tax is not sufficient to provide the entire amount of benefit due to the qualified company under this subdivision;\n\n(4) Job retention projects: a qualified company may receive a tax credit for the retention of jobs in this state, provided the qualified company and the project meets all of the following conditions:\n\n(a) For each of the twenty-four months preceding the year in which application for the program is made the qualified company must have maintained at least one thousand full-time employees at the employer's site in the state at which the jobs are based, and the average wage of such employees must meet or exceed the county average wage;\n\n(b) The qualified company retained at the project facility the level of full-time employees that existed in the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which application for the program is made;\n\n(c) The qualified company is considered to have a significant statewide effect on the economy, and has been determined to represent a substantial risk of relocation from the state by the quality jobs advisory task force established in section 620.1887; provided, however, until such time as the initial at-large members of the quality jobs advisory task force are appointed, this determination shall be made by the director of the department of economic development;\n\n(d) The qualified company in the project facility will cause to be invested a minimum of seventy million dollars in new investment prior to the end of two years or will cause to be invested a minimum of thirty million dollars in new investment prior to the end of two years and maintain an annual payroll of at least seventy million dollars during each of the years for which a credit is claimed; and\n\n(e) The local taxing entities shall provide local incentives of at least fifty percent of the new direct local revenues created by the project over a ten-year period.­­The quality jobs advisory task force may recommend to the department of economic development that appropriate penalties be applied to the company for violating the agreement. The amount of the job retention credit granted may be equal to up to fifty percent of the amount of withholding tax generated by the full-time jobs at the project facility for a period of five years. The calendar year annual maximum amount of tax credit that may be issued to any qualified company for a job retention project or combination of job retention projects shall be seven hundred fifty thousand dollars per year, but the maximum amount may be increased up to one million dollars if such action is proposed by the department and approved by the quality jobs advisory task force established in section 620.1887; provided, however, until such time as the initial at-large members of the quality jobs advisory task force are appointed, this determination shall be made by the director of the department of economic development. In considering such a request, the task force shall rely on economic modeling and other information supplied by the department when requesting the increased limit on behalf of the job retention project. In no event shall the total amount of all tax credits issued for the entire job retention program under this subdivision exceed three million dollars annually. Notwithstanding the above, no tax credits shall be issued for job retention projects approved by the department after August 30, 2013;\n\n­­The quality jobs advisory task force may recommend to the department of economic development that appropriate penalties be applied to the company for violating the agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, no tax credits shall be issued for job retention projects approved by the department after August 30, 2013;\n\n(5) Small business job retention and flood survivor relief: a qualified company may receive a tax credit under sections 620.1875 to 620.1890 for the retention of jobs and flood survivor relief in this state for each job retained over a three-year period, provided that:\n\n(a) The qualified company did not receive any state or federal benefits, incentives, or tax relief or abatement in locating its facility in a flood plain;\n\n(b) The qualified company and related companies have fewer than one hundred employees at the time application for the program is made;\n\n(c) The average wage of the qualified company's and related companies' employees must meet or exceed the county average wage;\n\n(d) All of the qualified company's and related companies' facilities are located in this state;\n\n(e) The facilities at the primary business site in this state have been directly damaged by floodwater rising above the level of a five hundred year flood at least two years, but fewer than eight years, prior to the time application is made;\n\n(f) The qualified company made significant efforts to protect the facilities prior to any impending danger from rising floodwaters;\n\n(g) For each year it receives tax credits under sections 620.1875 to 620.1890, the qualified company and related companies retained, at the company's facilities in this state, at least the level of full-time, year-round employees that existed in the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which application for the program is made; and\n\n(h) In the years it receives tax credits under sections 620.1875 to 620.1890, the company cumulatively invests at least two million dollars in capital improvements in facilities and equipment located at such facilities that are not located within a five hundred year flood plain as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and amended from time to time. The amount of the small business job retention and flood survivor relief credit granted may be equal to up to one hundred percent of the amount of withholding tax generated by the full-time jobs at the project facility for a period of three years. The calendar year annual maximum amount of tax credit that may be issued to any qualified company for a small business job retention and survivor relief project shall be two hundred fifty thousand dollars per year, but the maximum amount may be increased up to five hundred thousand dollars if such action is proposed by the department and approved by the quality jobs advisory task force established in section 620.1887. In considering such a request, the task force shall rely on economic modeling and other information supplied by the department when requesting an increase in the limit on behalf of the small business job retention and flood survivor relief project. In no event shall the total amount of all tax credits issued for the entire small business job retention and flood survivor relief program under this subdivision exceed five hundred thousand dollars annually. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision to the contrary, no tax credits shall be issued for small business job retention and flood survivor relief projects approved by the department after August 30, 2010.\n\n4. The qualified company shall provide an annual report of the number of jobs and such other information as may be required by the department to document the basis for the benefits of this program. The department may withhold the approval of any benefits until it is satisfied that proper documentation has been provided, and shall reduce the benefits to reflect any reduction in full-time employees or new payroll. Upon approval by the department, the qualified company may begin the retention of the withholding taxes when it reaches the minimum number of new jobs and the average wage exceeds the county average wage. Tax credits, if any, may be issued upon satisfaction by the department that the qualified company has exceeded the county average wage and the minimum number of new jobs. In such annual report, if the average wage is below the county average wage, the qualified company has not maintained the employee insurance as required, or if the number of new jobs is below the minimum, the qualified company shall not receive tax credits or retain the withholding tax for the balance of the benefit period. In the case of a qualified company that initially filed a notice of intent and received an approval from the department for high-impact benefits and the minimum number of new jobs in an annual report is below the minimum for high-impact projects, the company shall not receive tax credits for the balance of the benefit period but may continue to retain the withholding taxes if it otherwise meets the requirements of a small and expanding business under this program.\n\n5. The maximum calendar year annual tax credits issued for the entire program shall not exceed eighty million dollars. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the maximum annual tax credits authorized under section 135.535 are hereby reduced from ten million dollars to eight million dollars, with the balance of two million dollars transferred to this program. There shall be no limit on the amount of withholding taxes that may be retained by approved companies under this program.\n\n6. The department shall allocate the annual tax credits based on the date of the approval, reserving such tax credits based on the department's best estimate of new jobs and new payroll of the project, and the other factors in the determination of benefits of this program. However, the annual issuance of tax credits is subject to the annual verification of the actual new payroll. The allocation of tax credits for the period assigned to a project shall expire if, within two years from the date of commencement of operations, or approval if applicable, the minimum thresholds have not been achieved. The qualified company may retain authorized amounts from the withholding tax under this section once the minimum new jobs thresholds are met for the duration of the project period. No benefits shall be provided under this program until the qualified company meets the minimum new jobs thresholds. In the event the qualified company does not meet the minimum new job threshold, the qualified company may submit a new notice of intent or the department may provide a new approval for a new project of the qualified company at the project facility or other facilities.\n\n7. For a qualified company with flow-through tax treatment to its members, partners, or shareholders, the tax credit shall be allowed to members, partners, or shareholders in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the qualified company's tax period.\n\n8. Tax credits may be claimed against taxes otherwise imposed by chapters 143 and 148, and may not be carried forward but shall be claimed within one year of the close of the taxable year for which they were issued, except as provided under subdivision (4) of subsection 3 of this section.\n\n9. Tax credits authorized by this section may be transferred, sold, or assigned by filing a notarized endorsement thereof with the department that names the transferee, the amount of tax credit transferred, and the value received for the credit, as well as any other information reasonably requested by the department.\n\n10. Prior to the issuance of tax credits, the department shall verify through the department of revenue, or any other state department, that the tax credit applicant does not owe any delinquent income, sales, or use tax or interest or penalties on such taxes, or any delinquent fees or assessments levied by any state department and through the department of commerce and insurance that the applicant does not owe any delinquent insurance taxes. Such delinquency shall not affect the authorization of the application for such tax credits, except that at issuance credits shall be first applied to the delinquency and any amount issued shall be reduced by the applicant's tax delinquency. If the department of revenue or the department of commerce and insurance, or any other state department, concludes that a taxpayer is delinquent after June fifteenth but before July first of any year and the application of tax credits to such delinquency causes a tax deficiency on behalf of the taxpayer to arise, then the taxpayer shall be granted thirty days to satisfy the deficiency in which interest, penalties, and additions to tax shall be tolled. After applying all available credits toward a tax delinquency, the administering agency shall notify the appropriate department and that department shall update the amount of outstanding delinquent tax owed by the applicant. If any credits remain after satisfying all insurance, income, sales, and use tax delinquencies, the remaining credits shall be issued to the applicant, subject to the restrictions of other provisions of law.\n\n11. Except as provided under subdivision (4) of subsection 3 of this section, the director of revenue shall issue a refund to the qualified company to the extent that the amount of credits allowed in this section exceeds the amount of the qualified company's income tax.\n\n12. An employee of a qualified company will receive full credit for the amount of tax withheld as provided in section 143.211.\n\n13. If any provision of sections 620.1875 to 620.1890 or application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of these sections which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application, and to this end, the provisions of sections 620.1875 to 620.1890 are hereby declared severable.\n\n(L. 2005 S.B. 343, A.L. 2007 1st Ex.

Participation procedures, department duties, qualified company or qualified military project duties — maximum tax credits allowed, allocation — prohibited acts — report, contents — rulemaking authority — sunset date. —1. The department shall respond to a written request, by or on behalf of a qualified company or qualified military project, for a proposed benefit award under the provisions of this program within five business days of receipt of such request. The department shall respond to a written request, by or on behalf of a qualified manufacturing company, for a proposed benefit award under the provisions of this program within fifteen business days of receipt of such request. Such response shall contain either a proposal of benefits for the qualified company or qualified military project, or a written response refusing to provide such a proposal and stating the reasons for such refusal. A qualified company or qualified military project that intends to seek benefits under the program shall submit to the department a notice of intent. The department shall respond within thirty days to a notice of intent with an approval or a rejection, provided that the department may withhold approval or provide a contingent approval until it is satisfied that proper documentation of eligibility has been provided. The department shall certify or reject the qualifying company's plan outlined in their notice of intent as satisfying good faith efforts made to employ, at a minimum, commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census, the following: racial minorities, contractors who are racial minorities, and contractors that, in turn, employ at a minimum racial minorities commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census. Failure to respond on behalf of the department shall result in the notice of intent being deemed approved. A qualified company receiving approval for program benefits may receive additional benefits for subsequent new jobs at the same facility after the full initial project period if the applicable minimum job requirements are met. There shall be no limit on the number of project periods a qualified company may participate in the program, and a qualified company may elect to file a notice of intent to begin a new project period concurrent with an existing project period if the applicable minimum job requirements are achieved, the qualified company provides the department with the required annual reporting, and the qualified company is in compliance with this program and any other state programs in which the qualified company is currently or has previously participated. However, the qualified company shall not receive any further program benefits under the original approval for any new jobs created after the date of the new notice of intent, and any jobs created before the new notice of intent shall not be included as new jobs for purposes of the benefit calculation for the new approval. When a qualified company has filed and received approval of a notice of intent and subsequently files another notice of intent, the department shall apply the definition of project facility under subdivision (24) of section 620.2005 to the new notice of intent as well as all previously approved notices of intent and shall determine the application of the definitions of new job, new payroll, project facility base employment, and project facility base payroll accordingly.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the benefits available to the qualified company under any other state programs for which the company is eligible and which utilize withholding tax from the new or retained jobs of the company shall first be credited to the other state program before the withholding retention level applicable under this program will begin to accrue. If any qualified company also participates in a job training program utilizing withholding tax, the company shall retain no withholding tax under this program, but the department shall issue a refundable tax credit for the full amount of benefit allowed under this program. The calendar year annual maximum amount of tax credits which may be issued to a qualifying company that also participates in a job training program shall be increased by an amount equivalent to the withholding tax retained by that company under a jobs training program.\n\n3. A qualified company or qualified military project receiving benefits under this program shall provide an annual report of the number of jobs, along with minority jobs created or retained, and such other information as may be required by the department to document the basis for program benefits available no later than ninety days prior to the end of the qualified company's or industrial development authority's tax year immediately following the tax year for which the benefits provided under the program are attributed. In such annual report, if the average wage is below the applicable percentage of the county average wage, the qualified company or qualified military project has not maintained the employee insurance as required, if the department after a review determines the qualifying company fails to satisfy other aspects of their notice of intent, including failure to make good faith efforts to employ, at a minimum, commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census, the following: racial minorities, contractors who are racial minorities, and contractors that, in turn, employ at a minimum racial minorities commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census, or if the number of jobs is below the number required, the qualified company or qualified military project shall not receive tax credits or retain the withholding tax for the balance of the project period. If a statewide state of emergency exists for more than sixteen months, a qualified company or industrial development authority shall be entitled to a one-time suspension of program deadlines equal to the number of months such statewide state of emergency existed with any partial month rounded to the next whole. During such suspension, the qualified company or industrial development authority shall not be entitled to retain any withholding tax as calculated under subdivision (38) of section 620.2005 nor shall it earn any awarded tax credit or receive any tax credit under the program for the suspension period. The suspension period shall run consecutively and be available to a qualified company or industrial development authority that, during the statewide state of emergency, submitted notice of intent that was approved or that was in year one or a subsequent year of benefits under a program agreement with the department. The suspension period that runs consecutively and may be available to a qualified company or industrial development authority as provided in this subsection may apply retroactively. Any qualified company or industrial development authority requesting a suspension pursuant to this subsection shall submit notice to the department on its provided form identifying the requested start and end dates of the suspension, not to exceed the maximum number of months available under this subsection. Such notice shall be submitted to the department not later than the end of the twelfth month following the termination of the state of emergency. No suspension period shall start later than the date on which the state of emergency was terminated. The department and the qualified company or the industrial development authority shall enter into a program agreement or shall amend an existing program agreement, as applicable, stating the deadlines following the suspension period and updating the applicable wage requirements. Failure to timely file the annual report required under this section may result in the forfeiture of tax credits attributable to the year for which the reporting was required and a recapture of withholding taxes retained by the qualified company or qualified military project during such year.\n\n4. The department may withhold the approval of any benefits under this program until it is satisfied that proper documentation has been provided, and shall reduce the benefits to reflect any reduction in full-time employees or payroll. Upon approval by the department, the qualified company may begin the retention of the withholding taxes when it reaches the required number of jobs and the average wage meets or exceeds the applicable percentage of county average wage. Tax credits, if any, may be issued upon satisfaction by the department that the qualified company has exceeded the applicable percentage of county average wage and the required number of jobs; provided that, tax credits awarded under subsection 7 of section 620.2010 may be issued following the qualified company's acceptance of the department's proposal and pursuant to the requirements set forth in the written agreement between the department and the qualified company under subsection 4 of section 620.2010.\n\n5. Any qualified company or qualified military project approved for benefits under this program shall provide to the department, upon request, any and all information and records reasonably required to monitor compliance with program requirements. This program shall be considered a business recruitment tax credit under subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 135.800, and any qualified company or qualified military project approved for benefits under this program shall be subject to the provisions of sections 135.800 to 135.830.\n\n6. Any taxpayer who is awarded benefits under this program who knowingly hires individuals who are not allowed to work legally in the United States shall immediately forfeit such benefits and shall repay the state an amount equal to any state tax credits already redeemed and any withholding taxes already retained.\n\n7. (1) The maximum amount of tax credits that may be authorized under this program for any fiscal year shall be limited as follows, less the amount of any tax credits previously obligated for that fiscal year under any of the tax credit programs referenced in subsection 14 of this section:\n\n(a) For the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2013, but ending on or before June 30, 2014, no more than one hundred six million dollars in tax credits may be authorized;\n\n(b) For the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2014, but ending on or before June 30, 2015, no more than one hundred eleven million dollars in tax credits may be authorized;\n\n(c) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, but ending on or before June 30, 2020, no more than one hundred sixteen million dollars in tax credits may be authorized for each fiscal year; and\n\n(d) For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2020, no more than one hundred six million dollars in tax credits may be authorized for each fiscal year. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to tax credits issued to qualified companies under a notice of intent filed prior to July 1, 2020.\n\n(2) For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2020, in addition to the amount of tax credits that may be authorized under paragraph (d) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, an additional ten million dollars in tax credits may be authorized for each fiscal year for the purpose of the completion of infrastructure projects directly connected with the creation or retention of jobs under the provisions of sections 620.2000 to 620.2020 and an additional ten million dollars in tax credits may be authorized for each fiscal year for a qualified manufacturing company based on a manufacturing capital investment as set forth in section 620.2010.\n\n8. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2020, the maximum total amount of withholding tax that may be authorized for retention for the creation of new jobs under the provisions of sections 620.2000 to 620.2020 by qualified companies with a project facility base employment of at least fifty shall not exceed seventy-five million dollars for each fiscal year. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to withholding tax authorized for retention for the creation of new jobs by qualified companies with a project facility base employment of less than fifty.\n\n9. For tax credits for the creation of new jobs under section 620.2010, the department shall allocate the annual tax credits based on the date of the approval, reserving such tax credits based on the department's best estimate of new jobs and new payroll of the project, and any other applicable factors in determining the amount of benefits available to the qualified company or qualified military project under this program; provided that, the department may reserve up to twenty-one and one-half percent of the maximum annual amount of tax credits that may be authorized under subsection 7 of this section for award under subsection 7 of section 620.2010. However, the annual issuance of tax credits shall be subject to annual verification of actual payroll by the department or, for qualified military projects, annual verification of average salary for the jobs directly created by the qualified military project. Any authorization of tax credits shall expire if, within two years from the date of commencement of operations, or approval if applicable, the qualified company has failed to meet the applicable minimum job requirements. The qualified company may retain authorized amounts from the withholding tax under the project once the applicable minimum job requirements have been met for the duration of the project period. No benefits shall be provided under this program until the qualified company or qualified military project meets the applicable minimum new job requirements or, for benefits awarded under subsection 7 of section 620.2010, until the qualified company has satisfied the requirements set forth in the written agreement between the department and the qualified company under subsection 4 of section 620.2010. In the event the qualified company or qualified military project does not meet the applicable minimum new job requirements, the qualified company or qualified military project may submit a new notice of intent or the department may provide a new approval for a new project of the qualified company or qualified military project at the project facility or other facilities.\n\n10. Tax credits provided under this program may be claimed against taxes otherwise imposed by chapters 143 and 148, and may not be carried forward, but shall be claimed within one year of the close of the taxable year for which they were issued. Tax credits provided under this program may be transferred, sold, or assigned by filing a notarized endorsement thereof with the department that names the transferee, the amount of tax credit transferred, and the value received for the credit, as well as any other information reasonably requested by the department. For a qualified company with flow-through tax treatment to its members, partners, or shareholders, the tax credit shall be allowed to members, partners, or shareholders in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the qualified company's tax period.\n\n11. Prior to the issuance of tax credits or the qualified company beginning to retain withholding taxes, the department shall verify through the department of revenue and any other applicable state department that the tax credit applicant does not owe any delinquent income, sales, or use tax or interest or penalties on such taxes, or any delinquent fees or assessments levied by any state department and through the department of commerce and insurance that the applicant does not owe any delinquent insurance taxes or other fees. Such delinquency shall not affect the approval, except that any tax credits issued shall be first applied to the delinquency and any amount issued shall be reduced by the applicant's tax delinquency. If the department of revenue, the department of commerce and insurance, or any other state department concludes that a taxpayer is delinquent after June fifteenth but before July first of any year and the application of tax credits to such delinquency causes a tax deficiency on behalf of the taxpayer to arise, then the taxpayer shall be granted thirty days to satisfy the deficiency in which interest, penalties, and additions to tax shall be tolled. After applying all available credits toward a tax delinquency, the administering agency shall notify the appropriate department and that department shall update the amount of outstanding delinquent tax owed by the applicant. If any credits remain after satisfying all insurance, income, sales, and use tax delinquencies, the remaining credits shall be issued to the applicant, subject to the restrictions of other provisions of law.\n\n12. The director of revenue shall issue a refund to the qualified company to the extent that the amount of tax credits allowed under this program exceeds the amount of the qualified company's tax liability under chapter 143 or 148.\n\n13. An employee of a qualified company shall receive full credit for the amount of tax withheld as provided in section 143.211.\n\n14. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, beginning August 28, 2013, no new benefits shall be authorized for any project that had not received from the department a proposal or approval for such benefits prior to August 28, 2013, under the development tax credit program created under sections 32.100 to 32.125, the rebuilding communities tax credit program created under section 135.535, the enhanced enterprise zone tax credit program created under sections 135.950 to 135.973, and the Missouri quality jobs program created under sections 620.1875 to 620.1890. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit or impair the ability of any administering agency to authorize or issue benefits for any project that had received an approval or a proposal from the department under any of the programs referenced in this subsection prior to August 28, 2013, or the ability of any taxpayer to redeem any such tax credits or to retain any withholding tax under an approval issued prior to that date. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit or in any way impair the ability of any governing authority to provide any local abatement or designate a new zone under the enhanced enterprise zone program created by sections 135.950 to 135.963. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no qualified company that is awarded benefits under this program shall:\n\n(1) Simultaneously receive benefits under the programs referenced in this subsection at the same capital investment; or\n\n(2) Receive benefits under the provisions of section 620.1910 for the same jobs.\n\n15. If any provision of sections 620.2000 to 620.2020 or application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of these sections which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application, and to this end, the provisions of sections 620.2000 to 620.2020 are hereby declared severable.\n\n16. By no later than January 1, 2014, and the first day of each calendar quarter thereafter, the department shall present a quarterly report to the general assembly detailing the benefits authorized under this program during the immediately preceding calendar quarter to the extent such information may be disclosed under state and federal law. The report shall include, at a minimum:\n\n(1) A list of all approved and disapproved applicants for each tax credit;\n\n(2) A list of the aggregate amount of new or retained jobs that are directly attributable to the tax credits authorized;\n\n(3) A statement of the aggregate amount of new capital investment directly attributable to the tax credits authorized;\n\n(4) Documentation of the estimated net state fiscal benefit for each authorized project and, to the extent available, the actual benefit realized upon completion of such project or activity; and\n\n(5) The department's response time for each request for a proposed benefit award under this program.\n\n17. The department may adopt such rules, statements of policy, procedures, forms, and guidelines as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 620.2000 to 620.2020.

As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"County average wage\", the average wage in each county as determined by the department for the most recently completed full calendar year.

The governing bodies of at least two contiguous or overlapping political subdivisions in this state may establish one or more TIME zones, which shall be political subdivisions of the state, for the purposes of completing infrastructure projects to promote the economic development of the region. Such zones may only include the area within the governing bodies' jurisdiction, ownership, or control, and may include any such area. The governing bodies shall determine the boundaries for each TIME zone, and more than one TIME zone may exist within the governing bodies' jurisdiction or under the governing bodies' ownership or control, and may be expanded or contracted by resolution of the zone board.\n\n4. (1) To establish a TIME zone, the governing bodies of at least two political subdivisions shall each propose an ordinance or resolution creating such zone. Such ordinance or resolution shall set forth the names of the political subdivisions which will form the TIME zone, the general nature of the proposed improvements, the estimated cost of such improvements, the boundaries of the proposed TIME zone, and the estimated number of new jobs to be created in the TIME zone.

The governing bodies shall hear and pass upon all objections to the TIME zone and the proposed improvements, if any, and may amend the proposed improvements, and the plans and specifications therefor.\n\n(2) After the passage or adoption of the ordinance or resolution creating the TIME Zone, governance of the TIME zone shall be by the zone board, which shall consist of seven members selected from the political subdivisions creating the TIME zone. Members of a zone board shall receive no salary or other compensation for their services as members, but shall receive their necessary traveling and other expenses incurred while actually engaged in the discharge of their official duties.

Upon the completion of an agreement pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, twenty-five percent of the state tax withholdings imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265 on new jobs within a TIME zone after development or redevelopment has commenced shall not be remitted to the general revenue fund of the state of Missouri. Such moneys shall be deposited into the TIME zone fund established pursuant to subsection 10 of this section for the purpose of continuing to expand, develop, and redevelop TIME zones identified by the zone board, and may be used for managerial, engineering, legal, research, promotion, planning, and any other expenses.\n\n10. There is hereby created in the state treasury the \"TIME Zone Fund\", which shall consist of money collected under this section. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund and may approve disbursements from the fund in accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180 to the zone boards of the TIME zones from which the funds were collected, less the pro-rata portion appropriated by the general assembly to be used solely for the administration of this section, which shall not exceed ten percent of the total amount collected within the TIME zones of a zone board. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the general revenue fund. The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n11.

The department may promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.\n\n16. The provisions of section 23.253 notwithstanding, no TIME zone may be established after August 28, 2025. Any TIME zone created prior to such date shall continue to exist and be coterminous with the retirement of any debts incurred for improvements made within the TIME zone. No debts may be incurred or reauthorized using TIME zone revenue after August 28, 2025.\n\n(L. 2022 S.B. 672)",

If the report is not delivered within five days of such final notice, the sandbox program director shall assume that the applicable agency does not object to the temporary waiver or suspension of the relevant regulations for an applicant seeking to participate in the sandbox program.\n\n6. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, an applicable agency may, by written notice to the regulatory relief office:\n\n(a) Reject an application, provided such rejection occurs within forty-five days after the day on which the applicable agency receives a complete application for review, or within fifty days if an extension has been requested by the applicable agency, if the applicable agency determines, in the applicable agency's sole discretion, that the applicant's offering fails to comply with standards or specifications:\n\na.

Provides in the written report submitted pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection 5 of this section a description of the applicable agency's reasons approval of the application would create a substantial risk of harm to the health or safety of the public or Missouri's environment, or create unreasonable expenses for taxpayers in the state.\n\n(2) If any applicable agency rejects an application on a nonpreliminary basis pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, the regulatory relief office shall not approve the application.\n\n7. (1) The sandbox program director shall provide all applications and associated written reports to the advisory committee upon receiving a written report from an applicable agency.\n\n(2) The sandbox program director may call the advisory committee to meet as needed, but not less than once per quarter if applications are available for review.\n\n(3) After receiving and reviewing the application and each associated written report, the advisory committee shall provide to the sandbox program director the advisory committee's recommendation as to whether the applicant should be admitted as a sandbox participant.\n\n(4) As part of the advisory committee's review of each report, the advisory committee shall use criteria used by applicable agencies to evaluate applications.\n\n8. The regulatory relief office shall consult with each applicable agency and the advisory committee before admitting an applicant into the sandbox program. Such consultation may include seeking information and giving consideration to whether:\n\n(1) The applicable agency has previously issued a license or other authorization to the applicant; and\n\n(2) The applicable agency has previously investigated, sanctioned, or pursued legal action against the applicant and the reasons for such actions.\n\n9. In reviewing an application under this section, the regulatory relief office and applicable agencies shall consider whether:\n\n(1) A competitor to the applicant is or has been a sandbox participant and, if so, weigh that as a factor in favor of allowing the applicant to also become a sandbox participant;\n\n(2) The applicant's plan will adequately protect consumers from potential harm identified by an applicable agency in the applicable agency's written report;\n\n(3) The risk of harm to consumers is outweighed by the potential benefits to consumers from the applicant's participation in the sandbox program; and\n\n(4) Certain state regulations that regulate an innovative offering should not be waived or suspended even if the applicant is approved as a sandbox participant, including applicable antifraud or disclosure provisions.\n\n10. An applicant shall become a sandbox participant if the regulatory relief office approves the application for the sandbox program and enters into a written agreement with the applicant describing the specific regulations that are waived or suspended as part of participation in the sandbox program. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the regulatory relief office shall not enter into a written agreement with an applicant that exempts the applicant from any income, property, or sales tax liability unless such applicant otherwise qualifies for an exemption from such tax.\n\n11. (1) The sandbox program director may deny at his or her sole discretion any application submitted under this section for any reason, including if the sandbox program director determines that the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that suspending or waiving enforcement of a regulation would cause significant risk of harm to consumers or residents of the state.\n\n(2) If the sandbox program director denies an application submitted under this section, the regulatory relief office shall provide to the applicant a written description of the reasons for not allowing the applicant to become a sandbox participant.\n\n(3) The denial of an application submitted under this section shall not be subject to judicial or administrative review.\n\n(4) The acceptance or denial of an application submitted under this section may be overridden by an affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the advisory committee at the discretion of the advisory committee, provided such vote shall take place within fifteen business days of the sandbox program director's decision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the advisory committee shall not override a rejection made by an applicable agency.\n\n(5) The sandbox program director shall deny an application for participation in the sandbox program if the applicant or any person who seeks to participate with the applicant in demonstrating an innovative offering has been convicted, entered into a plea of nolo contendere, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere held in abeyance, for any crime involving significant theft, fraud, or dishonesty if the crime bears a significant relationship to the applicant's or other participant's ability to safely and competently participate in the sandbox program.\n\n12. When an applicant is approved for participation in the sandbox program, the sandbox program director shall provide notice of the approval on the department's website.\n\n13. Applications to participate in the sandbox program shall be considered public records for the purposes of chapter 610, provided, however, that any information contained in such applications that constitutes proprietary or confidential trade secrets shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 610.\n\n(L. 2024 S.B. 894 & 825)",
