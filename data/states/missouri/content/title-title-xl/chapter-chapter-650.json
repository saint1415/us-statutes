Upon receipt of the court order, the laboratory will determine that the requesting individual has no other qualifying offense as a result of any separate plea or conviction and no other qualifying arrest prior to expungement.\n\n(2) A person whose DNA record or DNA profile has been included in the state DNA database in accordance with this section and sections 650.050, 650.052, and 650.100 may request expungement on the grounds that the conviction has been reversed, the guilty plea on which the authority for including that person's DNA record or DNA profile was based has been set aside, or an expungement of all official records has been granted by the court under section 568.040.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of a written request for expungement, a certified copy of the final court order reversing the conviction, setting aside the plea, or granting an expungement of all official records under section 568.040, and any other information necessary to ascertain the validity of the request, the Missouri state highway patrol crime laboratory shall expunge all DNA records and identifiable information in the state DNA database pertaining to the person and destroy the DNA sample of the person, unless the Missouri state highway patrol determines that the person is otherwise obligated to submit a DNA sample. Within thirty days after the receipt of the court order, the Missouri state highway patrol shall notify the individual that it has expunged his or her DNA sample and DNA profile, or the basis for its determination that the person is otherwise obligated to submit a DNA sample.\n\n(4) The Missouri state highway patrol is not required to destroy any item of physical evidence obtained from a DNA sample if evidence relating to another person would thereby be destroyed.\n\n(5) Any identification, warrant, arrest, or evidentiary use of a DNA match derived from the database shall not be excluded or suppressed from evidence, nor shall any conviction be invalidated or reversed or plea set aside due to the failure to expunge or a delay in expunging DNA records.\n\n10. When a DNA sample is taken from an individual pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section and the prosecutor declines prosecution and notifies the arresting agency of that decision, the arresting agency shall notify the Missouri state highway patrol crime laboratory within ninety days of receiving such notification. Within thirty days of being notified by the arresting agency that the prosecutor has declined prosecution, the Missouri state highway patrol crime laboratory shall determine whether the individual has any other qualifying offenses or arrests that would require a DNA sample to be taken and retained. If the individual has no other qualifying offenses or arrests, the crime laboratory shall expunge all DNA records in the database taken at the arrest for which the prosecution was declined pertaining to the person and destroy the DNA sample of such person.\n\n11. When a DNA sample is taken of an arrestee for any offense listed under subsection 1 of this section and charges are filed:\n\n(1) If the charges are later withdrawn, the prosecutor shall notify the state highway patrol crime laboratory that such charges have been withdrawn;\n\n(2) If the case is dismissed, the court shall notify the state highway patrol crime laboratory of such dismissal;\n\n(3) If the court finds at the preliminary hearing that there is no probable cause that the defendant committed the offense, the court shall notify the state highway patrol crime laboratory of such finding;\n\n(4) If the defendant is found not guilty, the court shall notify the state highway patrol crime laboratory of such verdict.\n\n­­If the state highway patrol crime laboratory receives notice under this subsection, such crime laboratory shall determine, within thirty days, whether the individual has any other qualifying offenses or arrests that would require a DNA sample to be taken. If the individual has no other qualifying arrests or offenses, the crime laboratory shall expunge all DNA records in the database pertaining to such person and destroy the person's DNA sample.\n\n(L. 1991 S.B. 152 § 3, A.L. 1996 S.B. 578, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1000, A.L. 2005 H.B. 353 merged with S.B. 423, A.L. 2006 S.B. 1023, A.L. 2009 H.B. 62 merged with H.B. 152 merged with H.B. 481, A.L. 2012 S.B. 789, A.L. 2017 S.B. 34, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60)",

Individuals who are actually innocent may receive restitution, amount, petition, definition, limitations and requirements — guilt confirmed by DNA testing, procedures — petitions for restitution — order of expungement. —1. Notwithstanding the sovereign immunity of the state, any individual who was found guilty of a felony in a Missouri court and was later determined to be actually innocent of such crime may be paid restitution. The individual may receive an amount of one hundred seventy-nine dollars per day for each day of postconviction incarceration for the crime for which the individual is determined to be actually innocent. The petition for the payment of said restitution shall be filed with the sentencing court. For the purposes of this section, the term\"actually innocent\"shall mean:\n\n(1) The individual was convicted of a felony for which a final order of release was entered by the court;\n\n(2) All appeals of the order of release have been exhausted;\n\n(3) The individual was not serving any term of a sentence for any other crime concurrently with the sentence for which he or she is determined to be actually innocent, unless such individual was serving another concurrent sentence because his or her parole was revoked by a court or the parole board in connection with the crime for which the person has been exonerated. Regardless of whether any other basis may exist for the revocation of the person's probation or parole at the time of conviction for the crime for which the person is later determined to be actually innocent, when the court's or the parole board's sole stated reason for the revocation in its order is the conviction for the crime for which the person is later determined to be actually innocent, such order shall, for purposes of this section only, be conclusive evidence that the persons's probation or parole was revoked in connection with the crime for which the person has been exonerated; and\n\n(4) Testing ordered under section 547.035, or testing by the order of any state or federal court, if such person was exonerated on or before August 28, 2004, or testing ordered under section 650.055, if such person was or is exonerated after August 28, 2004, or after an evidentiary hearing and finding in a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding held pursuant to section 547.031 which demonstrates a person's innocence of the crime for which the person is in custody.\n\n­­Any individual who receives restitution under this section shall be prohibited from seeking any civil redress from the state, its departments and agencies, or any employee thereof, or any political subdivision or its employees. This section shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity for any purposes other than the restitution provided for herein. The department of corrections shall determine the aggregate amount of restitution owed during a fiscal year. If insufficient moneys are appropriated each fiscal year to pay restitution to such persons, the department shall pay each individual who has received an order awarding restitution a pro rata share of the amount appropriated. Provided sufficient moneys are appropriated to the department, the amounts owed to such individual shall be paid on June thirtieth of each subsequent fiscal year, until such time as the restitution to the individual has been paid in full. However, no individual awarded restitution under this subsection shall receive more than sixty-five thousand dollars during each fiscal year. No interest on unpaid restitution shall be awarded to the individual. However, an individual may also be awarded other nonmonetary relief, including counseling, housing assistance, and personal financial literary assistance.\n\n2. If the results of the DNA testing confirm the person's guilt, then the person filing for DNA testing under section 547.035, shall:\n\n(1) Be liable for any reasonable costs incurred when conducting the DNA test, including but not limited to the cost of the test. Such costs shall be determined by the court and shall be included in the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court; and\n\n(2) Be sanctioned under the provisions of section 217.262.\n\n3. A petition for payment of restitution under this section may be filed only by the individual determined to be actually innocent or the individual's legal guardian. No claim or petition for restitution under this section may be filed by the individual's heirs or assigns. An individual's right to receive restitution under this section is not assignable or otherwise transferrable. The state's obligation to pay restitution under this section shall cease upon the individual's death. Any beneficiary designation that purports to bequeath, assign, or otherwise convey the right to receive such restitution shall be void and unenforceable.\n\n4. An individual who is determined to be actually innocent of a crime under this chapter shall automatically be granted an order of expungement from the court in which he or she pled guilty or was sentenced to expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, plea, trial or conviction. Upon the court's granting of the order of expungement, the records and files maintained in any administrative or court proceeding in an associate or circuit division of the court shall be confidential and available only to the parties or by order of the court for good cause shown. The effect of such order shall be to restore such person to the status he or she occupied prior to such arrest, plea or conviction and as if such event had never taken place. No person as to whom such order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial, conviction or expungement in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose whatsoever and no such inquiry shall be made for information relating to an expungement under this section.\n\n(L. 2006 S.B. 1023, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1765, A.L. 2019 H.B. 547, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60, A.L. 2025 H.B. 495)\n\nSeverability clause, see § 1.1001",
