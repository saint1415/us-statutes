Division's estimation of expenses to be incurred during fiscal year — allocation of estimated expenses — written statement of assessment sent — state treasurer credit of payments — statement of revenues filed with division — application only to railroads. —1. The division shall, prior to the beginning of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year commencing on July 1, 1997, make an estimate of the expenses to be incurred by it during such fiscal year reasonably attributable to the regulation of railroads, railroad corporations, street railroads and street railroad corporations, as provided in chapters 386, 387, 388, 389, and 391 and this chapter, and shall also separately estimate the amount of these expenses which are:\n\n(1) Directly attributable to the regulation of railroads and railroad corporations;\n\n(2) Directly attributable to the regulation of street railroads and street railroad corporations; and\n\n(3) Not directly attributable to either of these groups.\n\n2. The division shall allocate to each of these groups of entities the estimated expenses directly attributable to the regulation of that group and an amount equal to such proportion of the estimated expenses not directly attributable to either group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of all entities within that group during the preceding calendar year bears to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of all railroads, railroad corporations, street railroads and street railroad corporations during that year.

The director of revenue shall remit such payments to the state treasurer.\n\n4. The state treasurer shall credit such payments to the railroad expense fund established pursuant to section 622.015, which fund shall be devoted solely to the payment of expenditures actually incurred by the division and attributable to its regulation of railroads, railroad corporations, street railroads and street railroad corporations. Any amount remaining in such special fund at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the general revenue fund, but shall be applicable by appropriation of the general assembly to the payment of these expenditures of the division in the succeeding fiscal year and shall be applied by the division to the reduction of the amount to be assessed to such entities in such succeeding fiscal year. A reduction shall be allocated to each of these groups of entities in proportion to the respective gross intrastate operating revenues of the respective groups during the preceding calendar year.\n\n5. In order to enable the division to make the allocations and assessments provided for in this section, each railroad, railroad corporation, street railroad and street railroad corporation which owns or operates any track within this state shall file with the division, within ten days after August 28, 1996, and thereafter on or before March thirty-first of each year, a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year, and if any of these entities shall fail to file such statement within the time prescribed in this section, the division shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding on such entity for the purposes of this section.\n\n6.

A skill performance evaluation certificate granted pursuant to this section shall apply to intrastate transportation only. The skill performance evaluation certificate shall be in the possession of the commercial driver any time he or she is operating a commercial motor vehicle.\n\n2. A person who wishes to obtain a skill performance evaluation certificate under this section shall submit to the division the following information:\n\n(1) The applicant's name, address, and telephone number;\n\n(2) The name, address, and telephone number of an employer co-applicant, if any;\n\n(3) A description of the applicant's experience in driving the type of vehicle to be operated under the skill performance evaluation certificate;\n\n(4) A description of the type of driving to be done under the skill performance evaluation certificate;\n\n(5) A description of any modifications to the vehicle the applicant intends to drive under the skill performance evaluation certificate that are designed to accommodate the applicant's medical condition or disability;\n\n(6) Whether the applicant has previously been granted another skill performance evaluation certificate pursuant to this section;\n\n(7) A copy of the applicant's current commercial driver's license;\n\n(8) A copy of a medical examiner's certificate showing that the applicant is medically unqualified to drive;\n\n(9) A statement from the applicant's treating physician that includes:\n\n(a) The extent to which the physician is familiar with the applicant's medical history;\n\n(b) A description of the applicant's medical condition for which a skill performance evaluation certificate is necessary;\n\n(c) Assurance that the applicant has the ability and willingness to follow any course of treatment prescribed by the physician, including the ability to self-monitor or manage the medical condition; and\n\n(d) The physician's professional opinion that the applicant's condition will not adversely affect the applicant's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely; and\n\n(10) Any other information considered necessary by the division including requiring a physical examination or medical report from a physician who specializes in a particular field of medical practice.\n\n3.

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2002, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2002 H.B. 1270 and H.B. 2032)",
