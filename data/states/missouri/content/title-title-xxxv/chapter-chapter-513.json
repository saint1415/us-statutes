A CAFA forfeiture proceeding shall be governed by the Missouri rules of court, rules of civil procedure, except to the extent that special rules of procedure are stated herein.\n\n3. Any property seized by a law enforcement officer or agent shall not be disposed of pursuant to section 542.301 or by the uniform disposition of unclaimed property act, sections 447.500 through 447.595, unless the CAFA proceeding involving the seized property does not result in a judgment of forfeiture.\n\n4. In cases where the property is abandoned or unclaimed, an in rem CAFA forfeiture proceeding may be instituted by petition by the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the property is located or seized by the attorney general's office. The proceeding may be commenced before or after seizure of the property.\n\n5. In lieu of, or in addition to, an in rem proceeding under subsection 4 of this section, the prosecuting attorney or attorney general may bring an in personam action for the forfeiture of property, which may be commenced by petition before or after the seizure of property.\n\n6. (1) If the petition is filed before seizure, it shall state what property is sought to be forfeited, that the property is within the jurisdiction of the court, the grounds for forfeiture, and the names of all persons known to have or claim an interest in the property. The court shall determine ex parte whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and that notice to those persons having or claiming an interest in the property prior to seizure would cause the loss or destruction of the property. If the court finds that reasonable cause does not exist to believe the property is subject to forfeiture, it shall dismiss the proceeding. If the court finds that reasonable cause does exist to believe the property is subject to forfeiture but there is not reasonable cause to believe that prior notice would result in loss or destruction, it shall order service on all persons known to have or claim an interest in the property prior to a further hearing on whether a writ of seizure should issue. If the court finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and to believe that prior notice would cause loss or destruction, it shall without any further hearing or notice issue a writ of seizure directing the sheriff of the county or other authorized law enforcement agency where the property is found to seize it.\n\n(2) Seizure may be effected by a law enforcement officer authorized to enforce the criminal laws of this state prior to the filing of the petition and without a writ of seizure if the seizure is incident to a lawful arrest, search, or inspection and the officer has probable cause to believe the property is subject to forfeiture and will be lost or destroyed if not seized. Within four days of the date of seizure, such seizure shall be reported by said officer to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the seizure is effected or the attorney general; and if in the opinion of the prosecuting attorney or attorney general forfeiture is warranted, the prosecuting attorney or attorney general shall, within ten days after receiving notice of seizure, file a petition for forfeiture. The petition shall state, in addition to the information required in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the date and place of seizure. The burden of proof will be on the investigative agency to prove all allegations contained in the petition.\n\n7. After the petition is filed or the seizure effected, whichever is later, every person known to have or claim an interest in the property shall be served, if not previously served, with a copy of the petition and a notice of seizure in the manner provided by the Missouri rules of court and rules of civil procedure. Service by publication may be ordered upon any party whose whereabouts cannot be determined or if there be unknown parties.\n\n8. The prosecuting attorney or attorney general to whom the seizure is reported shall report annually by January thirty-first for the previous calendar year all seizures. Such report shall include the date, time, and place of seizure, the property seized, the estimated value of the property seized, the person or persons from whom the property was seized, the criminal charges filed, and the disposition of the seizure, forfeiture and criminal actions. The report shall be made to the director of the Missouri department of public safety and shall be considered an open record. The prosecuting attorney or attorney general shall submit a copy of the report to the state auditor at the time the report is made to the director of the department of public safety.\n\n9. The state auditor shall make an annual report compiling the data received from law enforcement, prosecuting attorneys and the attorney general, and shall submit the report regarding seizures for the previous calendar year to the general assembly annually by February twenty-eighth.\n\n10. Intentional or knowing failure to comply with any reporting requirement contained in this section shall be a class A misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars.\n\n(L. 1986 S.B. 450 § 6, A.L. 1993 S.B. 180, A.L. 2001 S.B. 5 & 21)\n\n(1990) Forfeiture provisions of the drug statutes are manifestly penal laws in the sense of art.

In such cases, no property shall be forfeited unless the person charged is found guilty of or pleads guilty to a felony offense substantially related to the forfeiture.

The investigative agency may also name in the CAFA lien notice any other aliases, names, or fictitious names under which the person may be known.

Any trustee who conveys title to real property for which a CAFA lien notice has been filed at the time of the conveyance in the county where the real property is situated naming a person who, to the actual knowledge of the trustee, holds a beneficial interest in the trust shall be liable to the state for the greater of:\n\n(1) The amount of proceeds received directly by the person named in the CAFA lien notice as a result of the conveyance;\n\n(2) The amount of proceeds received by the trustee as a result of the conveyance and distributed to the person named in the CAFA lien notice; or\n\n(3) The fair market value of the interest of the person named in the CAFA lien notice in the real property so conveyed; however, if the trustee conveys the real property and holds the proceeds that would otherwise be paid or distributed to the beneficiary or at the direction of the beneficiary or his designee, the trustee's liability shall not exceed the amount of the proceeds so held for so long as the proceeds are held by the trustee.\n\n10. The filing of a CAFA lien notice shall not constitute a lien on the record title to real property as owned by the trustee except to the extent the trustee is named in the CAFA lien notice.

If no civil proceeding is then pending against the person named in a CAFA lien notice, any person named in a CAFA lien notice may institute an action against the investigative agency filing the notice in the county where the notice has been filed seeking a release or extinguishment of the notice; and, in such case:\n\n(1) The court shall, upon the motion of such person, immediately enter an order setting a date for hearing, which shall be not less than five nor more than ten days after the suit has been filed. The order, along with a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the investigative agency within three days after the institution of the suit. At the hearing, the court shall take evidence on the issue of whether any real property or beneficial interest owned by such person is covered by the CAFA lien notice or otherwise subject to forfeiture under the Missouri CAFA act. If such person shows by the preponderance of the evidence that the CAFA lien notice is not applicable to him or that any real property or beneficial interest owned by him is not subject to forfeiture under this act*, the court shall enter a judgment extinguishing the CAFA lien notice or releasing the real property or beneficial interest from the CAFA lien notice;\n\n(2) The court shall immediately enter its order releasing from the CAFA lien notice any specific real property or beneficial interest if a sale of the real property or beneficial interest is pending and the filing of the notice prevents the sale of the property or interest; provided, however, that the proceeds resulting from the sale of the real property or beneficial interest shall be deposited into the registry of the court, subject to the further order of the court; and\n\n(3) At the hearing set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court may release from the CAFA lien notice any real property or beneficial interest upon the posting by such person of such security as is equal to the value of the real property or beneficial interest owned by such person.\n\n5. In the event a civil proceeding is pending against a person named in a CAFA lien notice, the court, upon motion by said person, may grant the relief set forth herein.\n\n6. Upon acquittal or dismissal of a criminal action against a person also named in a CAFA action, the civil action shall be dismissed.\n\n(L. 1986 S.B. 450 § 17)\n\nEffective 3-17-86\n\n*\"This act\" (S.B. 450, 1986) contained numerous sections.

Transfer of property seized by state to federal agency, procedure — transfer not to be made unless violation is a felony — property owner may challenge, procedure. —1. No state or local law enforcement agency may transfer any property seized by the state or local agency to any federal agency for forfeiture under federal law until the prosecuting attorney and the circuit judge of the county in which the property was seized first review the seizure and approve the transfer to a federal agency, regardless of the identity of the seizing agency. The prosecuting attorney and the circuit judge shall not approve any transfer unless it reasonably appears the activity giving rise to the investigation or seizure involves more than one state or unless it is reasonably likely to result in federal criminal charges being filed, based upon a written statement of intent to prosecute from the United States attorney with jurisdiction. No transfer shall be made to a federal agency unless the violation would be a felony under Missouri law or federal law.\n\n2. Prior to transfer, in an ex parte proceeding, the prosecuting attorney shall file with the court a statement setting forth the facts and circumstances of the event or occurrence which led to the seizure of the property and the parties involved, if known. The court shall certify the filing, and notify by mailing to the last known address of the property owner that his property is subject to being transferred to the federal government and further notify the property owner of his right to file a petition stating legitimate grounds for challenging the transfer. If within ninety-six hours after the filing of the statement by the prosecuting attorney, the property owner by petition shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the property should not be transferred to the federal government for forfeiture, the court shall delay such transfer until a hearing may be held. If the court orders a delay in transfer, no later than ten days after the filing of a petition under this section and sections 513.649 and 513.651, a hearing shall be held unless the court deems, for good cause shown, that a continuance should be granted. At the hearing, if the prosecutor has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the investigation or seizure involved more than one state or that the nature of the investigation or seizure would be better pursued under the federal forfeiture statutes, the court shall order that the transfer shall be made.\n\n(L. 1993 H.B. 562 § 6 subsecs. 1, 2, A.L. 2001 S.B. 5 & 21)\n\n(1997) Section does not require a conviction for transfer to federal agency of seized property. The application for transfer must cite the specific felony statute with the elements of the offense as well as sufficient evidence to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is sufficiently connected to the felony. State v. Sledd, 949 S.W.2d 643 (W.D.Mo.).\n\n(2000) Seizure occurred when city police stopped and arrested claimant for traffic violations and took possession of money found in car; divestment of claimant's possessory interests occurred at that point and not when money was transferred to federal agents. Also, transfer was improper without first obtaining approval from circuit judge and prosecutor. Karpierz v. Easley, 31 S.W.3d 505 (Mo.App.W.D.).",
