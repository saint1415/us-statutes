A person whose action or proceeding is stayed by motion to the court may seek relief from the stay for good cause shown.

If perfection of an interest would otherwise require seizure of the property involved or the commencement of an action, the perfection shall instead be accomplished by filing, and by serving upon the receiver, or receiver's counsel, if any, notice of the interest within the time fixed by law for seizure or commencement;\n\n(4) The commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power;\n\n(5) The enforcement of a judgment, other than a money judgment, obtained in an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power, or with respect to any licensure of the debtor;\n\n(6) The exercise of a right of setoff, including but not limited to, any right of a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, or securities clearing agency to set off a claim for a margin payment or settlement payment arising out of a commodity contract, forward contract, or securities contract against cash, securities, or other property held or due from the commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, or securities clearing agency to margin, guarantee, secure, or settle the commodity contract, forward contract, or securities contract, and any right of a swap participant to set off a claim for a payment due to the swap participant under or in connection with a swap agreement against any payment due from the swap participant under or in connection with the swap agreement or against cash, securities, or other property of the debtor held by or due from the swap participant to guarantee, secure, or settle the swap agreement;\n\n(7) The establishment by a governmental unit of any tax liability and any appeal thereof; or\n\n(8) Any action pending in a court other than that in which the receiver is appointed until transcription of the order appointing the receiver or extending the stay is made to the other court in which an action against the debtor is pending.\n\n4.

Contracts and leases, receiver may assume or reject — action to compel rejection — consent to assume required, when. —1. A receiver may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor upon order of the court following notice and a hearing, which shall include notice to persons party to the executory contract or unexpired lease to be assumed or rejected. The court may condition assumption or rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease on the terms and conditions the court believes are just and proper under the particular circumstances of the action. Such terms and conditions may include a requirement that the receiver cures or provides adequate assurance that the receiver will promptly cure any default. A general receiver's performance of an executory contract or unexpired lease prior to the court's authorization of its assumption or rejection shall not constitute an assumption of the executory contract or unexpired lease, or an agreement by the receiver to assume it, nor otherwise preclude the receiver thereafter from seeking the court's authority to reject it.\n\n2. Any person party to an executory contract or unexpired lease may by motion seek to compel the rejection thereof at any time, such rejection the court shall order in its discretion, and as the interests of justice may require. In determining a motion to compel the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, the court may consider, among other factors:\n\n(1) Whether rejection is in the best interests of the receivership estate and the interests of creditors;\n\n(2) The extent to which the executory contract or unexpired lease burdens the receivership estate financially;\n\n(3) Whether the debtor is performing or is in breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease;\n\n(4) If the debtor is in breach of a financial provision of the executory contract or unexpired lease, the debtor's ability to cure such breach within a reasonable time; and\n\n(5) Harm suffered by the nondebtor person party to the executory contract or unexpired lease that results or may result from refusing the rejection thereof.\n\n3. Any obligation or liability incurred by a general receiver on account of the receiver's assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as an expense of the receivership. A receiver's rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as a breach of the contract or lease occurring immediately prior to the receiver's appointment; and the receiver's right to possess or use property pursuant to any executory contract or unexpired lease shall terminate upon rejection of such contract or lease. A nondebtor party to an executory contract or unexpired lease that is rejected by a receiver may take such steps as may be necessary under applicable law to terminate or cancel such contract or lease. The claim of a nondebtor party to an executory contract or unexpired lease resulting from a receiver's rejection of it shall be served upon the receiver within thirty days following the date the receiver gives notice of such rejection to such person, which notice shall indicate the right to file a claim within the thirty-day period.\n\n4. A receiver's power under this section to assume an executory contract or unexpired lease shall not be affected by any provision in such contract or lease that would effect or permit a forfeiture, modification, or termination of it on account of either the receiver's appointment, the financial condition of the debtor, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors by the debtor.\n\n5. A receiver may not assume an executory contract or unexpired lease of debtor without the consent of the other person party to such contract or lease if:\n\n(1) Applicable law would excuse a person, other than the debtor, from accepting performance from or rendering performance to anyone other than the debtor even in the absence of any provisions in the contract or lease expressly restricting or prohibiting an assignment of the person's rights or the performance of the debtor's duties;\n\n(2) The contract or lease is a contract to make a loan or extend credit or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the debtor, or to issue a security of the debtor; or\n\n(3) The executory contract or lease expires by its own terms, or under applicable law prior to the receiver's assumption thereof.\n\n6. A receiver may not assign an executory contract or unexpired lease without assuming it, absent the consent of the other parties to the contract or lease.\n\n7. If the receiver rejects an executory contract or unexpired lease for:\n\n(1) The sale of real property under which the debtor is the seller and the purchaser is in possession of the real property;\n\n(2) The sale of a real property timeshare interest under which the debtor is the seller;\n\n(3) The license of intellectual property rights under which the debtor is the licensor; or\n\n(4) The lease of real property in which the debtor is the lessor;\n\n­­then the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, license agreement, or lease, or alternatively, the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may remain in possession in which circumstance the purchaser, licensee, or lessee shall continue to perform all obligations arising thereunder as and when they may fall due, but may offset against any payments any damages occurring on account of the rejection after it occurs. The purchaser of real property in such a circumstance is entitled to receive from the receiver any deed or any other instrument of conveyance which the debtor is obligated to deliver under the executory contract when the purchaser becomes entitled to receive it, and the deed or instrument has the same force and effect as if given by the person. A purchaser, licensee, or lessee who elects to remain in possession under the terms of this subsection has no rights against the receiver on account of any damages arising from the receiver's rejection except as expressly provided for by this subsection. A purchaser of real property who elects to treat rejection of an executory contract as a termination has a lien against the interest in that real property of the debtor for the recovery of any portion of the purchase price that the purchaser has paid.\n\n8. Any contract with the state shall be deemed rejected if not assumed within sixty days of appointment of a general receiver unless the receiver and state agency agree to its assumption.\n\n9. Nothing in sections 515.500 to 515.665 affects the enforceability of anti-assignment prohibitions provided under contract or applicable law.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1765 merged with S.B. 578)",

However, an action seeking to dispossess a receiver of any estate property or otherwise to interfere with the receiver's management or control of any estate property may not be maintained or continued unless permitted by order of the court obtained upon notice and a hearing.\n\n2.

All adjunct actions shall be referred to the judge, if any, assigned to the receivership action.\n\n3.

The receiver with the court's approval after notice and a hearing may use, sell, or lease estate property other than in the ordinary course of business.\n\n2. The court may order that a general receiver's sale of estate property either under subsection 1 of this section, or consisting of real property that the debtor intended to sell in its ordinary course of business, be effected free and clear of liens, claims, and of all rights of redemption, whether or not the sale will generate proceeds sufficient to fully satisfy all claims secured by the property, unless either:\n\n(1) The property to be sold is real property used principally in the production of crops, livestock, or aquaculture, or the property is a homestead, and the owner of the property has not consented to the sale following the appointment of the receiver; or\n\n(2) A party in interest, including, but not limited to an owner of the property to be sold or a secured creditor as regards to the property to be sold serves and files a timely opposition to the receiver's sale, and the court determines that the amount likely to be realized by the receiver's sale is less than the amount that may be realized within a reasonable time in the absence of the receiver's sale.\n\n­­Upon any sale free and clear of liens authorized by this section, all liens encumbering the property sold shall transfer and attach to the proceeds of the sale, net of reasonable expenses incurred in the disposition of the property sold, in the same order, priority, and validity as the liens had with respect to the property sold immediately before the conveyance. The court may authorize the receiver at the time of sale to satisfy, in whole or in part, any lien on the property sold out of the proceeds of its sale if the interest of any other creditor having a lien against the proceeds of the sale would not thereby be impaired.\n\n3. At a public sale of estate property under subsection 1 of this section, a creditor with a lien against the property to be sold may credit bid at the sale of the property. A creditor with a lien against the property to be sold who purchases the property from a receiver may offset against the purchase price its secured claim against the property, provided that such secured creditor tenders cash sufficient to satisfy in full all secured claims payable out of the proceeds of sale having priority over such secured creditor's secured claim. If the lien or the claim it secures is the subject of a bona fide dispute, the court may order the holder of the lien or claim to provide the receiver with adequate security to assure full payment of the purchase price in the event the lien, the claim, or any part thereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable.\n\n4. If estate property includes an interest as a co-owner of property, the receiver shall have the rights and powers of a co-owner afforded by applicable state or federal law, including but not limited to, any rights of partition.\n\n5. The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization to sell or lease estate property under this section does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under that authorization to any person that purchased or leased the property in good faith, whether or not the person knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless the authorization and sale or lease were stayed pending the appeal.\n\n6. The notice of a proposed use, sale, or lease of estate property required by subsection 1 of this section shall include the time and place of any public sale, the terms and conditions of any private sale and the time fixed for filing objections, and shall be mailed to all parties in interest, and to such other persons as the court in the interests of justice may require.\n\n7. In determining whether a sale free and clear of liens, claims, encumbrances, and of all rights of redemption is in the best interest of the estate, the court may consider, among such other factors as the court deems appropriate, the following:\n\n(1) Whether the sale shall be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner considering assets of a similar type or nature;\n\n(2) Whether an independent appraisal supports the purchase price to be paid;\n\n(3) Whether creditors and parties in interest received adequate notice of the sale, sale procedures, and details of the proposed sale;\n\n(4) Any relationship between the buyer and the debtor;\n\n(5) Whether the sale is an arm's length transaction; and\n\n(6) Whether parties asserting a lien as to the property to be sold consent to the proposed sale.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1765 merged with S.B. 578)",
