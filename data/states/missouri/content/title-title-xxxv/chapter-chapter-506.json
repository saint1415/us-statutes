If there is, for the time being, no such officer as is specified by this subdivision, the court may designate an appropriate officer to whom the copies of the summons and petition may be delivered in order to effect service.\n\n2. When a defendant shall acknowledge in writing, endorsed on the writ, signed by his own proper signature, the service of such writ, and waive the necessity of the service thereof by an officer, such acknowledgment shall be deemed as valid as service in the manner provided by law.\n\n3. In all cases when the defendant shall refuse to hear the writ read or to receive a copy of the writ or petition, the offer of the officer to read the same or to deliver a copy thereof, and such refusal, shall be sufficient service of such writ.\n\n4. Service of the summons and petition upon a defendant of any class referred to in subdivision (1) or (3) of subsection 1 of this section may be made by the plaintiff or by any person authorized to serve process pursuant to section 506.140, by mailing a copy of the summons and petition by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the person to be served, together with two copies of a notice and acknowledgment conforming substantially to the form contained in subsection 5 of this section and a return envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the sender.

If the defendant so served does not appear, judgment may be rendered affecting said property, res or status within the jurisdiction of the court as to said defendant, but such service shall not warrant a general judgment against such defendant.\n\n2. A party desiring service by mail shall allege and state either in his verified petition or in a separate affidavit any one or more of the same specific grounds for substituted service as set forth in subsection 3, or shall state any other facts showing why personal service cannot be had on the defendant or defendants in this state. Such petition or affidavit shall be verified by oath of the party or of someone in his behalf, and shall state the address of the party to be served by mail. Upon the filing of such petition or affidavit with the judge or clerk, the clerk shall serve a copy of the summons and of the petition by registered mail, requesting a return receipt signed by addressee only, addressed to the defendant at the address furnished by plaintiff.\n\n3.

The notice shall also contain the name of the court and the names of the parties to the suit, and shall state the name and address of the attorney for plaintiff, if any, otherwise the plaintiff's address, and shall state that unless said named defendant or defendants file an answer or other pleading or shall otherwise appear and defend against the petition within forty-five days after the date of the first publication, to be stated in the published notice, provided, the court or judge thereof may extend the date within which any such defendant may plead or otherwise appear to a date certain beyond such forty-five day limit judgment by default will be rendered against them. Such notice shall be published at least once each week for four consecutive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published in the county where suit is instituted, if there be such newspaper published there, which the plaintiff or his attorney of record may designate; if no such newspaper be published in such county, then in some such paper published in this state, which the plaintiff or his attorney of record may designate as most likely to give notice to the defendant or defendants to be notified. If the present known address of the defendant is given, the clerk shall within ten days after said order of publication mail a copy of the notice to each defendant whose address has been stated in the affidavit or verified petition. The clerk shall file a certificate certifying that copies of the notice have been mailed as required by this section, in all cases where the present known address has been given, and such certificates shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.\n\n4. When the names of one or more defendants are unknown to plaintiff, he may so state in his verified petition, or in a separate affidavit for order of publication, and the court or judge or clerk thereof shall issue an order of publication of notice to the unknown defendant or defendants in the same manner prescribed in subsection 3, and the notice of publication shall be published in like manner. It shall be sufficient to name or describe said unknown defendants as the heirs, grantees, or successors of the person to whom the property to be affected was last known to have been transferred.\n\n5. Whenever publication of notice is ordered for service by mail or by publication in a newspaper, the court may also in its discretion, order that a summons be issued and delivered with a copy of the petition to the sheriff or other person especially appointed to serve the same, for personal service in the ordinary manner if the same can be had.\n\n6. In any of the cases mentioned in subsection 1, the plaintiff may cause a copy of the petition, with a copy of the summons, to be delivered to each defendant residing or being without this state, and at any place within the United States or their territories summoning said defendant to appear and plead within thirty days after service upon said defendant; and if the defendant shall refuse to receive such copy of the petition and summons, the offer of the officer to deliver same to him or them, and such refusal, shall be as effectual service as though such copies were actually delivered to such defendant. Such service may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process in civil actions within the state or territory where such service is made, or by his deputy, and shall be proved by the affidavit of such officer, or deputy, stating the time and manner of such service, made before the clerk or judge of the court of which affiant is an officer. Such clerk or judge shall certify to the official character of the affiant, and to his authority to serve process in civil actions within the state or territory where such service was made.

Any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of this state, who has lived in lawful marriage within this state, submits himself to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to all civil actions for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation and all obligations arising for maintenance of a spouse, support of any child of the marriage, attorney's fees, suit money, or disposition of marital property, if the other party to the lawful marriage lives in this state or if a third party has provided support to the spouse or to the children of the marriage and is a resident of this state.\n\n3. Only causes of action arising from acts enumerated in this section may be asserted against a defendant in an action in which jurisdiction over him is based upon this section.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 660 § 1, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1275, A.L. 1993 S.B. 253)\n\n(1969) This section is procedural and remedial and applies retrospectively to causes of action which accrued before its passage. State ex rel. Nichols v. Fuller (A.), 449 S.W.2d 11.\n\n(1970) The Missouri \"Long-Arm Statute\" is constitutional. State ex rel. Deere & Co. v. Pinnell (Mo.), 454 S.W.2d 889; State ex rel. Birdsboro Corp. v. Kimberlin (Mo.), 461 S.W.2d 292; Fulton v. Southern Pacific Co. (W.D.Mo.), 320 F.Supp. 45.\n\n(1970) This section does not deny due process. State ex rel. Deere and Co. v. Pinnell (Mo.), 454 S.W.2d 889.\n\n(1973) The phrase \"commission of a tortious act within this state\" includes extraterritorial acts producing actionable consequence in Missouri, also it is not necessary that cause of action pleaded sound in tort in order to confer jurisdiction under this section. Fulton v. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. (C.A. Mo.), 481 F.2d 326.\n\n(1973) A foreign corporation which manufactures a product for use in Missouri is subject to extraterritorial jurisdiction on the ground that a tortious act is committed within this state when the dealer seeks indemnification from the manufacturer by way of impleader, and mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel the impleader of such manufacturer. State ex rel. Apco Oil Corp. v. Turpin (A.), 490 S.W.2d 400.\n\n(1976) Held that evidence sustained finding of sufficient contact to give forum state jurisdiction. State ex rel. Peoples Bank, etc. v. Stussie (A.), 536 S.W.2d 934.\n\n(1976) Retention of unpaid draft for an unreasonable time by a Nebraska Bank which resulted in damages to Missouri bank was not sufficient to justify in personam jurisdiction by Missouri court. State ex rel. Bank of Gering v. Schoenlaub (Mo.), 540 S.W.2d 31.\n\n(1976) Service of process by sheriff of another state does not come under verity rule and may be collaterally attacked. Germanese v. Champlin (A.), 540 S.W.2d 109.\n\n(1984) In a declaratory judgment action relating to defendant's patent, the existence of a business relationship between the nonresident defendant corporation and a Missouri distributor of the product in question was held sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over the defendant corporation under subdivision (1) of subsection 1. Aluminum Housewares Co., Inc. v. Chip Clip Corp. (E.D. Mo.) 609 F.Supp. 358.\n\n(1984) Telephone conversations and written correspondence were insufficient contacts under the due process clause to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant on a contract claim, and were therefore also insufficient to satisfy the Missouri \"long arm\" statute. Inst. Food Marketing v. Golden State Strawberries (8th Cir.), 747 F.2d 448.\n\n(1985) Assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant did not violate the due process clause where the defendant \"transacted business within the state\" by selling and shipping conveyor belts to a Missouri buyer for installation in Illinois. Precision Const. Co. v. J.A. Slattery Co., Inc. (8th Cir.), 765 F.2d 114.\n\n(1986) Where Colorado savings and loan association solicited participation of Missouri savings and loan association in construction loans, negotiated agreement in Missouri, and where contract became binding through acceptance in Missouri, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Colorado savings and loan did not violate due process. St. Louis Fed. Sav. and Loan v. Silverado Banking. 626 F.Supp. 379 (E.D. Mo.).\n\n(1986) A foreign corporation which does no more than manufacture a product which eventually is used in this state does not have sufficient contact with the state for a circuit court to exercise jurisdiction over such corporation. State v. Adolf, 718 S.W.2d 550 (Mo.App.).\n\n(1987) Communication through the mails and by telephone to seller before contract was made and visit to seller in this state to perfect product design after contract was made by buyer are contacts sufficient to constitute the transaction of business in this state, thus subjecting nonresident buyer to jurisdiction of court of this state pursuant to this section without violating due process principles. Watlow Elec. Mfg. v. Sam Dick Industries, 734 S.W.2d 295 (Mo.App.).\n\n(1991) Where parties executed stock purchase agreement, promissory note to effectuate the agreement, and guaranty agreement on the indebtedness in Missouri and negotiations leading up to contract were conducted in Missouri, there was sufficient minimum contacts to satisfy federal due process and was sufficient to confer jurisdiction under Missouri Long-Arm Act, regardless of whether defendant also engaged in the transaction of business within the state. Portnoy v. Defiance, Inc., 951 F.2d 169 (8th Cir.).\n\n(2000) Nonresident trademark infringement defendant's website, which had not been accessed by any Missouri resident, did not give rise to sufficient contacts with state to allow court to exercise personal jurisdiction. Uncle Sam's Outfitters, Inc. v. Uncle Sam's Army Navy Outfitters-Manhattan, Inc., 96 F.Supp.2d 919 (E.D.Mo.).\n\n(2000) Foreign microbrewery, which advertised and sold beer club memberships to state residents using the internet and telephones and delivered beer to residents, was subject to personal jurisdiction; state interest in regulation of the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages outweighed burden on defendant. State ex rel. Nixon v. Beer Nuts, Ltd., 29 S.W.3d 828 (Mo.App.E.D.).\n\n(2002) Maintenance of an internet website allowing visitors to site to make hotel room reservations is not sufficient contact with Missouri to subject defendant to personal jurisdiction for alleged tort that occurred in another state.
