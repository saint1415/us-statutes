Intangible personal property shall be deemed to have a taxable situs in this state for the purpose of being subject to a property tax for the year 1947 and each succeeding year, where, at any time during the calendar year preceding the year for which the property is subject to said tax, the legal title thereto is owned by a person domiciled in this state, or by a domestic corporation, or where said intangible property acquires a business situs in this state when the legal title thereto is owned by a person not domiciled in this state, or by a foreign corporation.\n\n2. In all cases where both the persons holding or owning the legal title and the equitable title or beneficial interest in the same property are domiciled in this state, only the holder of the legal title shall be liable for such tax.
