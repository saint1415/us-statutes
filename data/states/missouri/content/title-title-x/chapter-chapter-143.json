Employer to withhold tax from wages — armed services, withholding from wages or retirement — federal civil service retirement, withholding authorized, when — inapplicable to out-of-state businesses, when. —1. Every employer maintaining an office or transacting any business within this state and making payment of any wages taxable under this chapter to a resident or nonresident individual shall deduct and withhold from such wages for each payroll period the amount provided in subsection 3 of this section.\n\n2. The term\"wages\"referred to in subsection 1 of this section means wages as defined by section 3401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The term\"employer\"means any person, firm, corporation, association, fiduciary of any kind, or other type of organization for whom an individual performs service as an employee, except that if the person or organization for whom the individual performs service does not have control of the payment of compensation for such service, the term\"employer\"means the person having control of the payment of the compensation. The term includes the United States, this state, other states, and all agencies, instrumentalities, and subdivisions of any of them.\n\n3. (1) The method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be prescribed by regulations of the director of revenue. The prescribed table, percentages, or other method shall result, so far as practicable, in withholding from the employee's wages during each calendar year an amount substantially equivalent to the tax reasonably estimated to be due from the employee under this chapter with respect to the amount of such wages included in his Missouri adjusted gross income during the calendar year.\n\n(2) The amount to be withheld by an employer with respect to tips received by an employee in the course of the employee's employment shall be calculated based solely upon the amount of tips reported by the employee in a written statement furnished to the employer as required by subsection (a) of Section 6053 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or, if greater, the amount of tips received by the employer and remitted to the employee. If an employee shares tips, the employer shall withhold only from the employee who actually receives*the shared tips. The employer's Missouri income tax withholding obligation with respect to an employee's tip income shall be limited to the portion of the employee's wages under the control of the employer against which the employer is required, pursuant to federal law, to withhold federal income taxes on the employee's tips. Such withholding obligation shall be calculated after making reductions for all required federal tax withholding, Missouri income tax withholding on nontip income, and other amounts which have higher legal priority.\n\n4. For purposes of this section an employee shall be entitled to the same number of personal and dependency withholding exemptions as the number of exemptions to which he is entitled for federal income tax withholding purposes. An employer may rely upon the number of federal withholding exemptions claimed by the employee, except where the employee provides the employer with a form claiming a different number of withholding exemptions in this state.\n\n5. The director of revenue may enter into agreements with the tax departments of other states (which require income tax to be withheld from the payment of wages) so as to govern the amounts to be withheld from the wages of residents of such states under this section. Such agreements may provide for recognition of anticipated tax credits in determining the amounts to be withheld and, under regulations prescribed by the director of revenue, may relieve employers in this state from withholding income tax on wages paid to nonresident employees. The agreements authorized by this subsection are subject to the condition that the tax department of such other states grant similar treatment to residents of this state.\n\n6.

The director of revenue, by regulation, may require an employer to timely remit the unpaid amount required to be deducted and withheld by section 143.191 at the end of any quarter-monthly period, only if the employer was required to deduct and withhold six thousand dollars or more in each of at least two months during the prior twelve months.\n\n2. The director may increase the monthly requirement to more than six thousand dollars or otherwise narrow the application of the quarter-monthly remittance system authorized by this section. The director may not require the remittance of withheld taxes more often than monthly unless authorized by this section.\n\n3. A remittance shall be timely if mailed as provided in section 143.851 within three banking days after the end of the quarter-monthly period or if received by the director or deposited in a depository designated by the director within four banking days after the end of the quarter-monthly period.\n\n4.

Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under sections 143.011 to 143.996 is hereby made liable for such tax. For purposes of assessment and collection, any amount required to be withheld and paid over to the director of revenue, and any penalties, interest, and additions to tax with respect thereto, shall be considered the tax of the employer. Any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under sections 143.011 to 143.996 shall be a special fund in trust for the director of revenue. No employee shall have any right of action against his employer in respect to any money deducted and withheld from his wages and paid over to the director of revenue in compliance or in good faith compliance with sections 143.011 to 143.996.\n\n2. Any officer, director, or statutory trustee of any corporation, including administratively dissolved corporations, or foreign corporations that have had their certificate of authority revoked, subject to the provisions of sections 143.191 to 143.265, who has the direct control, supervision or responsibility for filing returns and making payment of the amount of tax imposed in accordance with sections 143.191 to 143.265, and who fails to file or pay such return with the director of revenue shall be personally assessed for such amounts, including interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon. This assessment shall be imposed only in the event that the assessment on the corporation is final, and such corporation fails to pay such amounts to the director of revenue. Notice shall be given of the director of revenue's intent to make the assessment against such officers, directors, statutory trustees or employees. The personal liability of such officers, directors, statutory trustees or employees as provided in this section shall survive the administrative dissolution of the corporation or, if a foreign corporation, the revocation of the corporation's certificate of authority.\n\n3. If any employer required to withhold and remit tax under sections 143.191 to 143.265 or his successors shall sell all or substantially all of his or their business or shall quit the business, such employer or successor shall file a final return within fifteen days after the date of selling or quitting business.\n\n4. If any employer required to withhold and remit tax under sections 143.191 to 143.265 or his successors shall contract to sell all or substantially all of his or their business, the seller shall request from the director of revenue a statement or certificate as provided in subsection 6 of this section. The seller shall present such statement or certificate to the purchaser prior to consummation of the sale and secure the purchaser's signature thereon as validation of receipt. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in the seller being liable for an additional penalty equal to twenty-five percent of the seller's delinquency at the time of the sale. The provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, this additional penalty shall be the sole liability of the seller and shall not be a liability of the purchaser.\n\n5. Except as provided in subsections 6, 7, and 8 of this section, all successors, if any, shall be required to withhold an amount of the purchase money sufficient to cover the taxes, interest, additions to tax or penalties due and unpaid until such time as the former owner or predecessor, whether immediate or not, shall produce a receipt from the director of revenue showing that the taxes have been paid, or a certificate stating that no taxes are due. If the purchaser of a business shall fail to withhold the purchase money as required by this section and remit at the time of purchase all amounts so withheld to the director to pay all unpaid taxes, interest, additions to tax and penalties due from the former owner or predecessor, the purchaser shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest, additions to tax and penalties accrued and unpaid by the former owner of the business.\n\n6. The director of revenue shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, upon written request, furnish within fifteen days from the receipt of such a request by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such other methods as may be mutually agreed upon, to any owner, successor, secured creditor, purchaser, or in the case of a proposed purchaser, if joined in writing by the owner, a statement showing the amount of taxes, interest, additions to tax or penalties due and owing or a certificate showing that no taxes, interest, additions to tax or penalties are due under this chapter, including the date for the last payment for such taxes, interest, additions to tax or penalties as shown by the records of the director of revenue.\n\n7. A secured creditor who shall enforce a lien against a business subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be entitled to obtain from the director of revenue a statement of employer withholding tax due and the status of the employer withholding tax payments from the director of revenue in accordance with subsection 6 of this section. If the director of revenue does not respond within fifteen days from the date of receipt of such request by the secured creditor seeking to enforce its lien, it shall be conclusively presumed that all such employer withholding tax has been paid as to the secured creditor or any successor of the secured creditor, whether such successor be immediate or not. Nothing in this section shall eliminate the liability of the owner of the business owing employer withholding tax from the liability to pay such employer withholding tax. Any purchaser who acquires the business as a result of an enforcement action by a creditor shall be exempt from the liability set forth in subsection 5 of this section, whether such purchaser be immediate or subsequent thereto.\n\n8. Any such creditor who shall enforce a lien against a business subject to the provisions of this section shall be entitled to be paid the principal sums due, all accrued interest to the date of the payment, and the expenses of enforcing the lien of the secured creditor including attorney's fees. The balance, if any, shall be paid to the creditors having a priority interest thereto under the laws of the state of Missouri or the United States of America. Any balance then remaining, up to the amount of the tax, interest, additions to tax and penalties then due, shall be remitted to the director of revenue as provided by this section. Nothing in this section shall affect the priority of any lien filed by the director of revenue against the former owner or predecessor.\n\n9.

(1) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the taxpayer and the department of revenue, any adjustments by the department or by the taxpayer made after the expiration of the appropriate limitations period provided under section 143.711 or 143.801 shall be limited to changes to the taxpayer's tax liability arising from federal adjustments.\n\n(2) For purposes of compliance with this section, the time periods provided for in this chapter may be extended:\n\n(a) Automatically, upon written notice to the department of revenue, by ninety days for an audited partnership or tiered partner which has one hundred or more direct partners; or\n\n(b) By written agreement between the taxpayer and the department of revenue.\n\n(3) Any extension granted under this subsection for filing the federal adjustments report extends the last day prescribed by law for assessing any additional tax arising from the adjustments to federal taxable income and the period for filing a claim for refund or credit of taxes under section 143.781 or 143.821.\n\n14. The department of revenue shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2020, shall be invalid and void.\n\n15.

The Missouri taxable income of a corporation taxable under sections 143.011 to 143.996 shall be so much of its federal taxable income for the taxable year, with the modifications specified in subsections 2 to 4 of this section, as is derived from sources within Missouri as provided in section 143.451. The tax of a corporation shall be computed on its Missouri taxable income at the rates provided in section 143.071.\n\n2. There shall be added to or subtracted from federal taxable income the modifications to adjusted gross income provided in section 143.121, with the exception of subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of section 143.121, and the applicable modifications to itemized deductions provided in section 143.141. There shall be subtracted the federal income tax deduction provided in section 143.171. There shall be subtracted, to the extent included in federal taxable income, corporate dividends from sources within Missouri.\n\n3. (1) If an affiliated group of corporations files a consolidated income tax return for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes, then it may elect to file a Missouri consolidated income tax return. The federal consolidated taxable income of the electing affiliated group for the taxable year shall be its federal taxable income. All transactions between affiliated members of the affiliated group shall be eliminated on the Missouri consolidated income tax return.\n\n(2) So long as a federal consolidated income tax return is filed, an election made by an affiliated group of corporations to file a Missouri consolidated income tax return may be withdrawn or revoked only upon substantial change in the law or regulations adversely changing tax liability under this chapter, or with permission of the director of revenue upon the showing of good cause for such action. After such a withdrawal or revocation with respect to an affiliated group, it may not file a Missouri consolidated income tax return for five years thereafter, except with the approval of the director of revenue, and subject to such terms and conditions as he may prescribe.\n\n(3) No corporation which is part of an affiliated group of corporations filing a Missouri consolidated income tax return shall be required to file a separate Missouri corporate income tax return for the taxable year.\n\n(4) For each taxable year an affiliated group of corporations filing a federal consolidated income tax return does not file a Missouri consolidated income tax return, for purposes of computing the Missouri income tax, the federal taxable income of each member of the affiliated group shall be determined as if a separate federal income tax return had been filed by each such member.\n\n(5) The director of revenue may prescribe such regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter as he may deem necessary in order that the tax liability of any affiliated group of corporations making a Missouri consolidated income tax return, and of each corporation in the group, before, during, and after the period of affiliation, may be returned, determined, computed, assessed, collected, and adjusted, in such manner as clearly to reflect the Missouri taxable income derived from sources within this state and in order to prevent avoidance of such tax liability.\n\n4. If a net operating loss deduction is allowed for the taxable year, there shall be added to federal taxable income the amount of the net operating loss modification for each loss year as to which a portion of the net operating loss deduction is attributable. As used in this subsection, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Loss year\", the taxable year in which there occurs a federal net operating loss that is carried back or carried forward in whole or in part to another taxable year;\n\n(2)\"Net addition modification\", for any taxable year, the amount by which the sum of all required additions to federal taxable income provided in this chapter, except for the net operating loss modification, exceeds the combined sum of the amount of all required subtractions from federal taxable income provided in this chapter;\n\n(3)\"Net operating loss deduction\", a net operating loss deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or a net operating loss deduction allowed for Missouri income tax purposes under paragraph (d)*of subsection 2 of section 143.121, but not including any net operating loss deduction that is allowed for federal income tax purposes but disallowed for Missouri income tax purposes under paragraph (d)*of subsection 2 of section 143.121;\n\n(4)\"Net operating loss modification\", an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the net operating loss deduction attributable to that loss year or the amount by which the total net operating loss in the loss year is less than the sum of:\n\n(a) The net addition modification for that loss year; and\n\n(b) The cumulative net operating loss deductions attributable to that loss year allowed for the taxable year and all prior taxable years.\n\n5. For all tax years ending on or after July 1, 2002, federal taxable income may be a positive or negative amount.

If a member of an affected business entity does not timely file an opt-out election for a tax year, that member shall not be precluded from timely filing an opt-out election for subsequent tax years.\n\n6.

Any such credit shall be calculated in a manner to be prescribed by the director of revenue, provided such calculation is consistent with the provisions of this section, and further provided that the limitations provided in subsection 2 of section 143.081 shall apply to the credit authorized by this subsection.\n\n(2) If the amount of the credit authorized by this subsection exceeds such member's tax liability for the tax imposed pursuant to section 143.011, the excess amount shall not be refunded and shall not be carried forward.\n\n10. (1) Each corporation or fiduciary that is subject to the tax imposed pursuant to section 143.061 or 143.071 and that is a member, or, in the case of a fiduciary subject to tax under section 143.061, is the fiduciary of an estate or trust that is a member, shall be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 143.071.

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2022, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2022 H.B. 2400, A.L. 2024 H.B. 1912)",

Section 80a-2(a)(3)(C), as may be amended from time to time;\n\n(c)\"Distribution services\"include, but are not limited to, the services of advertising, servicing, marketing, underwriting or selling shares of an investment company, but, in the case of advertising, servicing or marketing shares, only where such service is performed by a person who is, or in the case of a closed end company, was, either engaged in the services of underwriting or selling investment company shares or affiliated with a person that is engaged in the service of underwriting or selling investment company shares. In the case of an open end company, such service of underwriting or selling shares must be performed pursuant to a contract entered into pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 80a-15(b), as from time to time amended;\n\n(d)\"Investment company\", any person registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time, (the act) or a company which would be required to register as an investment company under the act except that such person is exempt to such registration pursuant to Section 80a-3(c)(1) of the act;\n\n(e)\"Investment funds service corporation\"includes any corporation or S corporation doing business in the state which derives more than fifty percent of its gross income in the ordinary course of business from the provision directly or indirectly of management, distribution or administration services to or on behalf of an investment company or from trustees, sponsors and participants of employee benefit plans which have accounts in an investment company. An investment funds service corporation shall include any corporation or S corporation providing management services as an investment advisory firm registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended from time to time, regardless of the percentage of gross revenues consisting of fees from management services provided to or on behalf of an investment company;\n\n(f)\"Management services\"include but are not limited to, the rendering of investment advice directly or indirectly to an investment company making determinations as to when sales and purchases of securities are to be made on behalf of the investment company, or the selling or purchasing of securities constituting assets of an investment company, and related activities, but only where such activity or activities are performed:\n\na.

For purposes of this section, \"gross income\" is defined as that amount of income earned from qualifying sources without deduction of expenses related to the generation of such income;\n\n(h)\"Residence\", presumptively the fund shareholder's mailing address on the records of the investment company. If, however, the investment company or the investment funds service corporation has actual knowledge that the fund shareholder's primary residence or principal place of business is different than the fund shareholder's mailing address such presumption shall not control. To the extent an investment funds service corporation does not have access to the records of the investment company, the investment funds service corporation may employ reasonable methods to determine the investment company fund shareholder's residence.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding other provisions of law to the contrary, qualifying sales of an investment funds service corporation, or S corporation, shall be considered wholly in this state only to the extent that the fund shareholders of the investment companies, to which the investment funds service corporation, or S corporation, provide services, are residenced in this state. Wholly in this state qualifying sales of an investment funds service corporation, or S corporation, shall be determined as follows:\n\n(a) By multiplying the investment funds service corporation's total dollar amount of qualifying sales from services provided to each investment company by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the average of the number of shares owned by the investment company's fund shareholders residenced in this state at the beginning of and at the end of the investment company's taxable year that ends with or within the investment funds service corporation's taxable year, and the denominator of which shall be the average of the number of shares owned by the investment company's fund shareholders everywhere at the beginning of and at the end of the investment company's taxable year that ends with or within the investment funds service corporation's taxable year;\n\n(b) A separate computation shall be made to determine the wholly in this state qualifying sales from each investment company. The qualifying sales for each investment company shall be multiplied by the respective percentage of each fund, as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision. The product of this equation shall result in the wholly in this state qualifying sales. The qualifying sales for each investment company which are not wholly in this state will be considered wholly without this state;\n\n(c) To the extent an investment funds service corporation has sales which are not qualifying sales, those nonqualified sales shall be apportioned to this state based on the methodology utilized by the investment funds service corporation without regard to this subdivision.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding the Multistate Tax Compact, sections 32.200 to 32.240, this section, and section 143.461 to the contrary, sales and business transactions shall not include any intercompany transactions, as that term is defined under 26 C.F.R. 1.1502 -13, between corporations that file a consolidated income tax return in this state.\n\n3. Any corporation described in subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 organized in this state or granted a permit to operate in this state for the transportation or care of passengers shall report its gross earnings within the state on intrastate business and shall also report its gross earnings on all interstate business done in this state which report shall be subject to inquiry for the purpose of determining the amount of income to be included in Missouri taxable income. The previous sentence shall not apply to a railroad.\n\n4. A corporation described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income all income arising from all sources in this state and all income from each transportation service wholly within this state, from each service where the only lines of such corporation used are those in this state, and such proportion of revenue from each service where the facilities of such corporation in this state and in another state or states are used, as the mileage used over the lines of such corporation in the state shall bear to the total mileage used over the lines of such corporation. The taxpayer may elect to compute the portion of income from all sources within this state in the following manner:\n\n(1) The income from all sources shall be determined as provided;\n\n(2) The amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in this state in fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements, plus the value on December thirty-first of each year of any fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements in this state leased from any other railroad shall be divided by the sum of the total amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements, plus the value on December thirty-first of each year, of any fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements leased from any other railroad. Where any fixed transportation facilities, real estate or improvements are leased by more than one railroad, such portion of the value shall be used by each railroad as the rental paid by each shall bear to the rental paid by all lessees. The income shall be multiplied by the fraction thus obtained to determine the proportion to be used to arrive at the amount of Missouri taxable income.\n\n5. A corporation described in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income one-half of the net income from the operation of a bridge between this and another state. If any such bridge is owned or operated by a railroad corporation or corporations, or by a corporation owning a railroad corporation using such bridge, then the figures for operation of such bridge may be included in the return of such railroad or railroads; or if such bridge is owned or operated by any other corporation which may now or hereafter be required to file an income tax return, one-half of the income or loss to such corporation from such bridge may be included in such return by adding or subtracting same to or from another net income or loss shown by the return.\n\n6. A corporation described in subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income all income arising from all sources within this state. Income shall include revenue from each telephonic or telegraphic service rendered wholly within this state; from each service rendered for which the only facilities of such corporation used are those in this state; and from each service rendered over the facilities of such corporation in this state and in other state or states, such proportion of such revenue as the mileage involved in this state shall bear to the total mileage involved over the lines of said company in all states. The taxpayer may elect to compute the portion of income from all sources within this state in the following manner:\n\n(1) The income from all sources shall be determined as provided;\n\n(2) The amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in this state in telephonic or telegraphic facilities, real estate and improvements thereon, shall be divided by the amount of the total investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in telephonic or telegraphic facilities, real estate and improvements. The income of the taxpayer shall be multiplied by the fraction thus obtained to determine the proportion to be used to arrive at the amount of Missouri taxable income.\n\n7. From the income determined in subsections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this section to be from all sources within this state shall be deducted such of the deductions for expenses in determining Missouri taxable income as were incurred in this state to produce such income and all losses actually sustained in this state in the business of the corporation.\n\n8. If a corporation derives only part of its income from sources within Missouri, its Missouri taxable income shall only reflect the effect of the following listed deductions to the extent applicable to Missouri. The deductions are: (a) its deduction for federal income taxes pursuant to section 143.171, and (b) the effect on Missouri taxable income of the deduction for net operating loss allowed by Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. The extent applicable to Missouri shall be determined by multiplying the amount that would otherwise affect Missouri taxable income by the ratio for the year of the Missouri taxable income of the corporation for the year divided by the Missouri taxable income for the year as though the corporation had derived all of its income from sources within Missouri. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, Missouri taxable income shall not reflect the listed deductions.\n\n9. Any investment funds service corporation organized as a corporation or S corporation which has any shareholders residenced in this state shall be subject to Missouri income tax as provided in this chapter.\n\n10. The provisions of this section do not impact any other apportionment election available to a taxpayer under Missouri statutes unless explicitly stated in this section.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 549, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1335, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1098, A.L. 1997 2d Ex.

Taxable income, what constitutes — definitions — taxable in another state, when — rents and royalties — sale of tangible personal property — transportation services — deductions — S corporations. —1. Missouri taxable income of a corporation shall include all income derived from sources within this state.\n\n2. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, a corporation described in subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall determine its income derived from sources within this state by allocating and apportioning its net income as provided in this section.\n\n3. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Apportionable income\":\n\n(a) All income that is apportionable under the Constitution of the United States and is not allocated under the laws of this state, including:\n\na. Income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the corporation's trade or business; and\n\nb. Income arising from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, employment, development, or disposition of the property is or was related to the operation of the corporation's trade or business; and\n\n(b) Any income that would be allocable to this state under the Constitution of the United States, but that is apportioned rather than allocated pursuant to the laws of this state;\n\n(2)\"Commercial domicile\", the principal place from which the trade or business of the corporation is directed or managed;\n\n(3)\"Financial organization\", any bank, trust company, savings bank, industrial bank, land bank, safe deposit company, private banker, savings and loan association, credit union, cooperative bank, small loan company, sales finance company, investment company, or any type of insurance company;\n\n(4)\"Nonapportionable income\", all income other than apportionable income;\n\n(5)\"Public utility\", any business entity:\n\n(a) Which owns or operates any plant, equipment, property, franchise, or license for the transmission of communications, transportation of goods or persons, except by pipeline, or the production, transmission, sale, delivery, or furnishing of electricity, water or steam; and\n\n(b) Whose rates of charges for goods or services have been established or approved by a federal, state, or local government or governmental agency;\n\n(6)\"Receipts\", all gross receipts of the corporation that are not allocated under the provisions of this section, and that are received from transactions and activity in the regular course of the corporation's trade or business; except that receipts of a corporation from hedging transactions and from the maturity, redemption, sale, exchange, loan or other disposition of cash or securities, shall be excluded.\n\n4. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this section, a corporation is taxable in another state if:\n\n(1) In that state it is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax; or\n\n(2) That state has jurisdiction to subject the corporation to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not do so.\n\n5. Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonapportionable income, shall be allocated as provided in subsections 6 to 9 of this section.\n\n6. (1) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state.\n\n(2) Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to this state:\n\n(a) If and to the extent the property is utilized in this state; or\n\n(b) In their entirety if the corporation's commercial domicile is in this state and the corporation is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized.\n\n(3) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the corporation, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.\n\n7. (1) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state.\n\n(2) Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if:\n\n(a) The property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale; or\n\n(b) The corporation's commercial domicile is in this state and the corporation is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs.\n\n(3) Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the corporation's commercial domicile is in this state.\n\n8. Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the corporation's commercial domicile is in this state.\n\n9. (1) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state:\n\n(a) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state; or\n\n(b) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the corporation is not taxable and the corporation's commercial domicile is in this state.\n\n(2) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the corporation's commercial domicile is located.\n\n(3) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the corporation's commercial domicile is located.\n\n10. All apportionable income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the net income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total receipts of the corporation in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the total receipts of the corporation everywhere during the tax period.\n\n11. Receipts from the sale of tangible personal property are in this state if the property is received in this state by the purchaser. In the case of the delivery of goods by common carrier or by other means of transportation, including transportation by the purchaser, the place at which the goods are ultimately received after all transportation has been completed shall be considered as the place at which the goods are received by the purchaser. Direct delivery into this state by the taxpayer to a person or firm designated by a purchaser from within or without the state shall constitute delivery to the purchaser in this state.\n\n12. (1) Receipts, other than receipts described in subsection 11 of this section, are in this state if the corporation's market for the sales is in this state. The corporation's market for sales is in this state:\n\n(a) In the case of sale, rental, lease, or license of real property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;\n\n(b) In the case of rental, lease, or license of tangible personal property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;\n\n(c) In the case of sale of a service, if and to the extent the ultimate beneficiary of the service is located in this state and shall not be in this state if the ultimate beneficiary of the service rendered by the corporation or the corporation's designee is located outside this state; and\n\n(d) In the case of intangible property:\n\na. That is rented, leased, or licensed, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, provided that intangible property utilized in marketing a good or service to a consumer is \"used in this state\" if that good or service is purchased by a consumer who is in this state.

That is sold, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, provided that:\n\n(i) A contract right, government license, or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area is \"used in this state\" if the geographic area includes all or part of this state;\n\n(ii) Receipts from intangible property sales that are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible property shall be treated as receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing of such intangible property under subparagraph a. of this paragraph; and\n\n(iii) All other receipts from a sale of intangible property shall be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the receipts factor.\n\n(2) If the state or states of assignment under subdivision (1) of this subsection cannot be determined, the state or states of assignment shall be reasonably approximated.\n\n(3) The director may prescribe regulations as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n13. (1) In the case of certain industries where unusual factual situations produce inequitable results under the apportionment and allocation provisions of this section, the director shall promulgate rules for determining the apportionment and allocation factors for each such industry, but such rules shall be applied uniformly.\n\n(2) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the corporation's income applicable to this state, the corporation may petition for or the director may require:\n\n(a) Separate accounting;\n\n(b) The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the corporation's income applicable to this state; or\n\n(c) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the corporation's income.\n\n(3) The party petitioning for, or the director requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the corporation's income pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection shall prove by a preponderance of evidence:\n\n(a) That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the corporation's income applicable to this state; and\n\n(b) That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.\n\n­­The same burden of proof shall apply whether the corporation is petitioning for, or the director is requiring, the use of any reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the corporation's income. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the director can show that in any two of the prior five tax years, the corporation had used an allocation or apportionment method at variance with its allocation or apportionment method or methods used for such other tax years, then the director shall not bear the burden of proof in imposing a different method pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(4) If the director requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the corporation's income, the director cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the corporation's reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section.\n\n(5) A corporation that has received written permission from the director to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the corporation's income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the corporation upon which the director reasonably relied.\n\n14. Any corporation described in subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 organized in this state or granted a permit to operate in this state for the transportation or care of passengers shall report its gross earnings within the state on intrastate business and shall also report its gross earnings on all interstate business done in this state. Such report shall be subject to inquiry for the purpose of determining the amount of income to be included in Missouri taxable income. This subsection shall not apply to a railroad.\n\n15. A corporation described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income all income arising from all sources in this state and all income from each transportation service wholly within this state, from each service where the only rails and lines of such corporation used are those in this state, and such proportion of revenue from each service where the facilities of such corporation in this state and in another state or states are used, as the mileage used over the rails and lines of such corporation in the state shall bear to the total mileage used over the rails and lines of such corporation. The corporation may elect to compute the portion of income from all sources within this state in the following manner:\n\n(1) The income from all sources shall be determined as provided;\n\n(2) The amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in this state in fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements, plus the value on December thirty-first of each year of any fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements in this state leased from any other railroad shall be divided by the sum of the total amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements, plus the value on December thirty-first of each year, of any fixed transportation facilities, real estate and improvements leased from any other railroad. Where any fixed transportation facilities, real estate or improvements are leased by more than one railroad, such portion of the value shall be used by each railroad as the rental paid by each shall bear to the rental paid by all lessees. The income shall be multiplied by the fraction thus obtained to determine the proportion to be used to arrive at the amount of Missouri taxable income.\n\n16. A corporation described in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income one-half of the net income from the operation of a bridge between this and another state. If any such bridge is owned or operated by a railroad corporation or corporations, or by a corporation owning a railroad corporation using such bridge, then the figures for operation of such bridge may be included in the return of such railroad or railroads; or if such bridge is owned or operated by any other corporation which may now or hereafter be required to file an income tax return, one-half of the income or loss to such corporation from such bridge may be included in such return by adding or subtracting the same to or from another net income or loss shown by the return.\n\n17. A corporation described in subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 143.441 shall include in its Missouri taxable income all income arising from all sources within this state. Income shall include revenue from each telephonic or telegraphic service rendered wholly within this state; from each service rendered for which the only facilities of such corporation used are those in this state; and from each service rendered over the facilities of such corporation in this state and in other state or states, such proportion of such revenue as the mileage involved in this state shall bear to the total mileage involved over the lines of said company in all states. The corporation may elect to compute the portion of income from all sources within this state in the following manner:\n\n(1) The income from all sources shall be determined as provided;\n\n(2) The amount of investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in this state in telephonic or telegraphic facilities, real estate and improvements thereon, shall be divided by the amount of the total investment of such corporation on December thirty-first of each year in telephonic or telegraphic facilities, real estate and improvements. The income of the corporation shall be multiplied by the fraction thus obtained to determine the proportion to be used to arrive at the amount of Missouri taxable income.\n\n18. From the income determined in this section to be from all sources within this state shall be deducted such of the deductions for expenses in determining Missouri taxable income as were incurred in this state to produce such income and all losses actually sustained in this state in the business of the corporation.\n\n19. If a corporation derives only part of its income from sources within Missouri, its Missouri taxable income shall only reflect the effect on Missouri taxable income of the deduction for net operating loss allowed by Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. The extent applicable to Missouri shall be determined by multiplying the amount that would otherwise affect Missouri taxable income by the ratio for the year of the Missouri taxable income of the corporation for the year divided by the Missouri taxable income for the year as though the corporation had derived all of its income from sources within Missouri. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, Missouri taxable income shall not reflect the deduction.\n\n20. Any investment funds service corporation organized as a corporation or S corporation which has any shareholders residenced in this state shall be subject to Missouri income tax as provided in this chapter.\n\n(L. 2018 S.B. 884)",

If the corporation shall keep its books and records so as to show the income applicable to this state by any other method of allocation between this state and other states, including gross income and deductions applicable thereto, and such method shows the income applicable to this state, including gross income and deductions applicable thereto, then it may, on or before sixty days before the end of any taxable year, petition the director of revenue, in writing, to be permitted in its return required to be filed to apportion to this state according to the method shown by such books or records.

S corporations, shareholders — composite returns — withholding required, when, how determined — pro rata share of certain tax credits for banking S corporations, S corporations that are associations, or credit institutions. —1. An S corporation, as defined by Section 1361 (a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall not be subject to the taxes imposed by section 143.071, or other sections imposing income tax on corporations.\n\n2. A shareholder of an S corporation shall determine such shareholder's S corporation modification and pro rata share, including its character, by applying the following:\n\n(1) Any modification described in sections 143.121 and 143.141 which relates to an item of S corporation income, gain, loss, or deduction shall be made in accordance with the shareholder's pro rata share, for federal income tax purposes, of the item to which the modification relates. Where a shareholder's pro rata share of any such item is not required to be taken into account separately for federal income tax purposes, the shareholder's pro rata share of such item shall be determined in accordance with his pro rata share, for federal income tax purposes, of S corporation taxable income or loss generally;\n\n(2) Each item of S corporation income, gain, loss, or deduction shall have the same character for a shareholder pursuant to sections 143.005 to 143.998 as it has for federal income tax purposes. Where an item is not characterized for federal income tax purposes, it shall have the same character for a shareholder as if realized directly from the source from which realized by the S corporation or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the S corporation.\n\n3. A nonresident shareholder of an S corporation shall determine such shareholder's Missouri nonresident adjusted gross income and his or her nonresident shareholder modification by applying the provisions of this subsection. Items shall be determined to be from sources within this state pursuant to regulations of the director of revenue in a manner consistent with the division of income provisions of section 143.451, section 143.461, or section 32.200 (Multistate Tax Compact). In determining the adjusted gross income of a nonresident shareholder of any S corporation, there shall be included only that part derived from or connected with sources in this state of the shareholder's pro rata share of items of S corporation income, gain, loss or deduction entering into shareholder's federal adjusted gross income, as such part is determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the director of revenue in accordance with the general rules in section 143.181. Any modification described in subsections 2 and 3 of section 143.121 and in section 143.141, which relates to an item of S corporation income, gain, loss, or deduction shall be made in accordance with the shareholder's pro rata share, for federal income tax purposes, of the item to which the modification relates, but limited to the portion of such item derived from or connected with sources in this state.\n\n4. Notwithstanding subsection 3 of this section to the contrary, for all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, the items referred to in that subsection shall be determined to be from sources within this state pursuant to regulations of the director of revenue in a manner consistent with the division of income provisions of section 143.455 and section 143.461.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall permit S corporations to file composite returns and to make composite payments of tax on behalf of its nonresident shareholders not otherwise required to file a return. If the nonresident shareholder's filing requirements result solely from one or more interests in any other partnerships or subchapter S corporations, that nonresident shareholder may be included in the composite return.\n\n6. If an S corporation pays or credits amounts to any of its nonresident individual shareholders as dividends or as their share of the S corporation's undistributed taxable income for the taxable year, the S corporation shall either timely file with the department of revenue an agreement as provided in subsection 7 of this section or withhold Missouri income tax as provided in subsection 8 of this section. An S corporation that timely files an agreement as provided in subsection 7 of this section with respect to a nonresident shareholder for a taxable year shall be considered to have timely filed such an agreement for each subsequent taxable year. An S corporation that does not timely file such an agreement for a taxable year shall not be precluded from timely filing such an agreement for subsequent taxable years. An S corporation is not required to deduct and withhold Missouri income tax for a nonresident shareholder if:\n\n(1) The nonresident shareholder not otherwise required to file a return agrees to have the Missouri income tax due paid as part of the S corporation's composite return;\n\n(2) The nonresident shareholder not otherwise required to file a return had Missouri assignable federal adjusted gross income from the S corporation of less than twelve hundred dollars;\n\n(3) The S corporation is liquidated or terminated;\n\n(4) Income was generated by a transaction related to termination or liquidation; or\n\n(5) No cash or other property was distributed in the current and prior taxable year.\n\n7. The agreement referred to in subdivision (1) of subsection 6 of this section is an agreement of a nonresident shareholder of the S corporation to:\n\n(1) File a return in accordance with the provisions of section 143.481 and to make timely payment of all taxes imposed on the shareholder by this state with respect to income of the S corporation; and\n\n(2) Be subject to personal jurisdiction in this state for purposes of the collection of income taxes, together with related interest and penalties, imposed on the shareholder by this state with respect to the income of the S corporation.\n\n­­The agreement will be considered timely filed for a taxable year, and for all subsequent taxable years, if it is filed at or before the time the annual return for such taxable year is required to be filed pursuant to section 143.511.\n\n8. The amount of Missouri income tax to be withheld is determined by multiplying the amount of dividends or undistributed income allocable to Missouri that is paid or credited to a nonresident shareholder during the taxable year by the highest rate used to determine a Missouri income tax liability for an individual, except that the amount of the tax withheld may be determined based on withholding tables provided by the director of revenue if the shareholder submits a Missouri withholding allowance certificate.\n\n9. An S corporation shall be entitled to recover for a shareholder on whose behalf a tax payment was made pursuant to this section, if such shareholder has no tax liability.\n\n10. With respect to S corporations that are banks or bank holding companies, a pro rata share of the tax credit for the tax payable pursuant to chapter 148 shall be allowed against each S corporation shareholders' state income tax as follows, provided the bank otherwise complies with section 148.112:\n\n(1) The credit allowed by this subsection shall be equal to the bank tax calculated pursuant to chapter 148 based on bank income in 1999 and after, on a bank that makes an election pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 1362, and such credit shall be allocated to the qualifying shareholder according to stock ownership, determined by multiplying a fraction, where the numerator is the shareholder's stock, and the denominator is the total stock issued by such bank or bank holding company;\n\n(2) The tax credit authorized in this subsection shall be permitted only to the shareholders that qualify as S corporation shareholders, provided the stock at all times during the taxable period qualifies as S corporation stock as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 1361, and such stock is held by the shareholder during the taxable period. The credit created by this section on a yearly basis is available to each qualifying shareholder, including shareholders filing joint returns. A bank holding company is not allowed this credit, except that, such credit shall flow through to such bank holding company's qualified shareholders, and be allocated to such shareholders under the same conditions; and\n\n(3) In the event such shareholder cannot use all or part of the tax credit in the taxable period of receipt, such shareholder may carry forward such tax credit for a period of the lesser of five years or until used, provided such credits are used as soon as the taxpayer has Missouri taxable income.\n\n11. With respect to S corporations that are associations, a pro rata share of the tax credit for the tax payable under chapter 148 shall be allowed against each S corporation shareholders' state income tax as follows, provided the association otherwise complies with section 148.655:\n\n(1) The credit allowed by this subsection shall be equal to the savings and loan association tax calculated under chapter 148 based on the computations provided in section 148.630 on an association that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. Section 1362, and such credit shall be allocated to the qualifying shareholder according to stock ownership, determined by multiplying a fraction, where the numerator is the shareholder's stock, and the denominator is the total stock issued by the association;\n\n(2) The tax credit authorized in this subsection shall be permitted only to the shareholders that qualify as S corporation shareholders, provided the stock at all times during the taxable period qualifies as S corporation stock as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 1361, and such stock is held by the shareholder during the taxable period. The credit created by this section on a yearly basis is available to each qualifying shareholder, including shareholders filing joint returns. A savings and loan association holding company is not allowed this credit, except that, such credit shall flow through to such savings and loan association holding company's qualified shareholders, and be allocated to such shareholders under the same conditions; and\n\n(3) In the event such shareholder cannot use all or part of the tax credit in the taxable period of receipt, such shareholder may carry forward such tax credit for a period of the lesser of five years or until used, provided such credits are used as soon as the taxpayer has Missouri taxable income.\n\n12. With respect to S corporations that are credit institutions, a pro rata share of the tax credit for the tax payable under chapter 148 shall be allowed against each S corporation shareholders' state income tax as follows, provided the credit institution otherwise complies with section 148.657:\n\n(1) The credit allowed by this subsection shall be equal to the credit institution tax calculated under chapter 148 based on the computations provided in section 148.150 on a credit institution that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. Section 1362, and such credit shall be allocated to the qualifying shareholder according to stock ownership, determined by multiplying a fraction, where the numerator is the shareholder's stock, and the denominator is the total stock issued by such credit institution;\n\n(2) The tax credit authorized in this subsection shall be permitted only to the shareholders that qualify as S corporation shareholders, provided the stock at all times during the taxable period qualifies as S corporation stock as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 1361, and such stock is held by the shareholder during the taxable period. The credit created by this section on a yearly basis is available to each qualifying shareholder, including shareholders filing joint returns. A credit institution holding company is not allowed this credit, except that, such credit shall flow through to such credit institution holding company's qualified shareholders, and be allocated to such shareholders under the same conditions; and\n\n(3) In the event such shareholder cannot use all or part of the tax credit in the taxable period of receipt, such shareholder may carry forward such tax credit for a period of the lesser of five years or until used, provided such credits are used as soon as the taxpayer has Missouri taxable income.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 549, A.L. 1983 H.B. 849, A.L. 1989 H.B. 35, et al., A.L. 1993 S.B. 66 & 20, A.L. 1997 H.B. 655 merged with S.B. 170, A.L. 1999 S.B. 386, A.L. 2006 S.B. 892, A.L. 2018 S.B. 884)\n\n(1990) Apportionment factor for corporate taxpayers for sale totally or partially outside state is not available to resident shareholders of S corporations.

The term\"Missouri estimated tax\"means the amount which the taxpayer estimates to be the income tax under sections 143.011 to 143.996 for the taxable year less the amount which the taxpayer estimates to be the sum of any credits allowable, including tax withheld.\n\n4. If they are eligible to file a joint declaration for federal tax purposes, a husband and wife may make a combined declaration of estimated tax as if they were one taxpayer, in which case the liability with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and several. If a combined declaration is made, the estimated tax for such year may be treated as the estimated tax of either husband or wife, or may be divided between them, as they may elect on a combined return or on their separate returns.\n\n5. An individual or corporation may amend a declaration under regulations prescribed by the director of revenue.\n\n6. If on or before January thirty-first (on or before March first in the case of a farmer referred to in subsection 2 of section 143.531) of the succeeding taxable year an individual files a return for the taxable year for which the declaration is required, and pays in full the amount shown on the return as payable, such return:\n\n(1) Shall be considered as his declaration if no declaration was required to be filed during the taxable year, but is otherwise required to be filed on or before January fifteenth; or\n\n(2) Shall be considered as the amendment permitted by subsection 5 to be filed on or before January fifteenth if the tax shown on the return is greater than the estimated tax shown in a declaration previously made.\n\n7. An individual or corporation having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration in accordance with regulations of the director of revenue.\n\n8. The declaration of estimated tax for an individual under a disability shall be made and filed in the manner provided in section 143.501 for an income tax return.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 549, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1054, et al., A.L. 1998 H.B. 1301)",

Within the time frame specified by the department, a state agency seeking to collect a debt through setoff shall supply the information necessary to identify each debtor whose refund is sought to be set off and certify the amount of the debt or debts owed by each such debtor.\n\n2. If a debtor identified by a state agency is determined by the department to be entitled to a refund of at least twenty-five dollars, the department shall notify the state agency that a refund has been set off on behalf of the agency and shall certify the amount of such setoff, which shall not exceed the amount of the claimed debt certified.

Failure of the debtor to make application for a hearing shall cause the setoff to be applied toward the debt. If the debt is based on a court or administrative order, the debtor shall be entitled to assert only those defenses which arose subsequent to such court or administrative order, and no issue may be raised at the hearing which has previously been litigated.

In order to obtain a refund due him such taxpayer must apply, in writing, for an apportionment of the refund with the state agency named in the notice within thirty days of the date of receipt of the notice, unless, in anticipation of the setoff of his spouse's refund, such nonobligated taxpayer provided the department of revenue with a request for apportionment of the anticipated refund which was filed at the same time the original tax return was filed, in which case the department of revenue shall determine the apportionment of the refund and forward the determination of apportionment and the nonobligated taxpayer's portion of the refund to the nonobligated taxpayer within fifteen working days of the transfer of the obligated taxpayer's portion of the refund to the agency requesting such setoff. Unless a request for apportionment of the anticipated refund was provided to the department of revenue as provided in this section, within ninety days after the filing of such taxpayer's application for apportionment of the refund with the state agency named in the notice a determination of apportionment shall be mailed to the nonobligated taxpayer by the appropriate state agency.

In the case of such a claim, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period provided in subsections 2, 3 and 4 of this section, whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable to such carryback.\n\n7. (1) No period of limitations provided in subsections 1 to 6 of this section shall apply if a taxpayer amends, or the federal Internal Revenue Service or its successor agency changes, the taxpayer's federal income tax return for the same tax period and:\n\n(a) Such amendment or change occurs after any period of limitations provided in subsections 1 to 6 of this section has expired;\n\n(b) Such amendment or change reveals that the taxpayer is eligible to claim a credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed under this chapter; and\n\n(c) A period of limitations provided in subsections 1 to 6 of this section prohibits the taxpayer from claiming such credit or refund.\n\n(2) If the taxpayer files a claim for such credit or refund, the claim shall be filed in the manner provided in this chapter and shall be filed within one year from the time the taxpayer amends or the federal Internal Revenue Service changes the taxpayer's federal income tax return.\n\n(L. 1972 S.B. 549, A.L. 2015 H.B. 517 & 754)\n\n(1989) Missouri's income tax scheme violates principles of intergovernmental tax immunity.

The director may release any part of the property subject to the lien by filing with the county recorder a copy of the original lien document and an affidavit containing a legal description of the property, and stating that the property is to be released from the lien. The county recorder shall note the partial release in the same manner as provided in section 443.090. The release of any specific property shall not affect in any manner other property subject to lien.\n\n4. Each county recorder shall receive a fee of three dollars which shall be charged for the filing of each certificate of lien and a fee of one dollar and fifty cents for each release of lien filed for record. Such amounts shall be paid to the county recorder from funds appropriated to the department of revenue for that purpose. The county recorder shall be reimbursed by presenting a statement, showing the number of certificates and releases filed, to the department of revenue each calendar quarter. The department of revenue is authorized to collect an additional penalty from each taxpayer equal to the cost of filing a certificate of lien or release of lien with respect to such taxpayer.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall establish and maintain records for all certificates of lien filed under this section. The director shall also maintain records of all releases of lien filed under this section. The provisions of section 32.057 to the contrary notwithstanding, the records prepared by the director under this section, to the extent such information is or may be on file with the recorder, shall be open to public inspection. Such records established and maintained by the director shall not be the official record and are not conclusive evidence of any liability of any taxpayer to this state.\n\n6. If any action is taken by the director under the provisions of this chapter; including, but not limited to, section 143.791, to alter or abate any assessment upon which a judgment has been filed under the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, the director is authorized to file a modification or satisfaction of such judgment.\n\n(L. 1988 H.B. 1335, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1155)",

(1) In a court of competent jurisdiction, the director of the department may commence suit to enjoin any paid tax return preparer from further engaging in any conduct described under subdivision 2 of this subsection or from further action as a paid tax return preparer.\n\n(2) In any action under subdivision (1) of this subsection, if the court finds that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent the recurrence of this conduct, the court may enjoin the paid tax return preparer from further engaging in any conduct specified in this subdivision. The court may enjoin conduct when a paid tax return preparer has done any of the following:\n\n(a) Prepared any income tax return or claim for refund that includes an understatement of a taxpayer's liability due to an unreasonable position.

Employer contributions to an individual medical account which are used to pay for health care expenses of the employee in accordance with this section shall be exempt from state income tax under this chapter, to the extent such contributions are not excluded from gross income under 26 U.S.C. 105 and 26 U.S.C. 106 and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to qualify for such an exemption from taxation under this chapter, such contributions shall be made in accordance with health care coverage arrangements which contain at a minimum the following components:\n\n(1) The employer shall annually determine a contribution level to be expended for coverage of an insured person and any dependents, which shall be in lieu of any standard indemnity or health insurance provided under a health insurance benefit package which is established by the department of commerce and insurance. Such a benefit package may be offered as an individual or group policy or other insurance arrangement by an insurer, health maintenance organization, health services corporation, or as a self-funded employer plan. A percentage of the employer's designated contribution level as established by rule and regulation of the department of commerce and insurance shall be used by the insurer, health maintenance organization, health services corporation, or as a self-funded employer plan to purchase or provide a policy or plan of major medical health care benefits for the insured person and any dependents. The remainder of the employer's contribution level not used to provide major medical coverage shall be used to fund an individual medical account. Funds in the account shall be used by the insured person or his dependents, if any, to pay for that portion of bona fide medical and health care expenses not covered by the policy or plan of major medical health insurance coverage, including any deductible, co-payment, or coinsurance requirements established by regulation of the department of commerce and insurance to discourage unnecessary use of health care services. Funds in the individual medical account shall be spent for no other purpose except as otherwise provided by this section;\n\n(2) Any amount in the insured's individual medical account that is unspent at the end of the year shall remain in the account. The director of the department of commerce and insurance shall by rule and regulation establish a balance for the account which, if exceeded, shall allow the insured to withdraw any moneys in excess of such balance. Any moneys so withdrawn from the account and interest earned on such moneys shall be subject to state income taxation;\n\n(3) The amount in an individual medical account shall not be subject to state income taxation while it remains in the account. Any amount spent from the individual medical account on medical and health care expenses and interest accrued on such amount shall be totally exempt from state income taxation;\n\n(4) The insurer, health maintenance organization, health services corporation, or employer which sponsors or provides health insurance coverage as authorized by this section shall administer the account on behalf of the insured person and any dependents.\n\n2. As used in this section, bona fide medical and health care expenses shall be those medical and health procedures as defined by regulation of the department of commerce and insurance.

(1) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2023, a taxpayer engaged in the manufacturing of goods or the distribution of manufactured goods that uses water port facilities or airports in this state and increases its port cargo volume at these facilities by a minimum of five percent in a single calendar year over its base year port cargo volume shall be allowed to claim a deduction in an amount determined by the department. The department may waive the requirement that port cargo volume be increased by a minimum of five percent over base year port cargo volume for any taxpayer that qualifies as a major facility.\n\n(2) Qualifying taxpayers that increase their port cargo volume by a minimum of five percent in a qualifying calendar year shall be allowed to claim a fifty dollar deduction for each TEU or the noncontainerized cargo equivalent above the base year port cargo volume. A qualifying taxpayer that is a major facility as defined in this section shall be allowed to claim a fifty dollar deduction for each TEU or the noncontainerized cargo equivalent transported through a water port facility or airport during the major facility's first calendar year. A qualifying taxpayer shall not claim a deduction of more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars for each calendar year except as provided for in subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section. The maximum amount of deductions for all qualifying taxpayers under this section shall not exceed three million five hundred thousand dollars for each calendar year.\n\n(3) The deduction may be claimed by the taxpayer as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection only if the taxpayer owns the cargo at the time the water port facilities or airports are used.\n\n3. (1) For every year in which a taxpayer claims the deduction, the taxpayer shall submit an application to the department by March first of the calendar year after the calendar year in which the increase in port cargo volume occurs. The taxpayer shall attach a schedule to the taxpayer's application to the department with the following information and any other information requested by the department:\n\n(a) A description of how the base year port cargo volume and the increase in port cargo volume were determined;\n\n(b) The amount of the base year port cargo volume;\n\n(c) The amount of the increase in port cargo volume for the tax year stated both as a percentage increase and as a total increase in net tons of noncontainerized cargo and TEUs of cargo, including information that demonstrates an increase in port cargo volume in excess of the minimum amount required to claim the deductions under this section; and\n\n(d) Any deduction utilized by the taxpayer in prior years.\n\n(2) The taxpayer shall claim the deduction on its income tax return in a manner prescribed by the department of revenue, and the department of revenue may require a copy of the certification form issued by a Missouri port authority or airport be attached to the return or otherwise provided.\n\n(L. 2016 S.B. 861)",

Recapture of the deduction amount under the following circumstances shall be accomplished by increasing the tax in any of the five years succeeding the tax year in which a deduction has been earned pursuant to this section if the number of qualified full-time employees falls below the average number of qualified full-time employees during the tax year. The Missouri taxable income increase amount shall be determined by recalculating the deduction that would have been earned for the original tax year using the decreased number of qualified full-time employees and subtracting the recalculated deduction amount from the amount previously earned. In the event that the average number of qualified full-time employees employed at an international trade facility falls below the number employed by the taxpayer prior to claiming any deductions under this section in any of the five tax years succeeding the year in which the deductions were earned, all deductions earned with respect to the international trade facility shall be recaptured.
