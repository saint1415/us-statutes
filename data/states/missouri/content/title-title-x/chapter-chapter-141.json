The court shall hear evidence and determine every issue of law and of fact necessary to a complete adjudication of all tax liens asserted by any and every pleading, and may also hear evidence and determine any other issue of law or fact affecting any other right, title, or interest in or to, or lien upon, such real estate, sought to be enforced by any party to the proceeding against any other party to the proceeding who has been served by process or publication as authorized by law, or who has voluntarily appeared, and shall determine the order and priority of the liens and of any other rights or interest put in issue by the pleadings.\n\n3. After the court has first determined the validity of the tax liens of all tax bills affecting parcels of real estate described in the petition, the priorities of the respective tax bills and the amounts due thereon, including principal, interest, penalties, attorney's fees, and costs, the court shall thereupon enter judgment of foreclosure of such liens and fix the time and place of the foreclosure sale. The petition shall be dismissed as to any parcel of real estate redeemed prior to the time fixed for the sheriff's foreclosure sale as provided in sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015. If the parcel of real estate auctioned off at sheriff's foreclosure sale is sold for a sum sufficient to fully pay the principal amount of all tax bills included in the judgment, together with interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs, and for no more, and such sale is confirmed by the court, then all other proceedings as to such parcels of real estate shall be finally dismissed as to all parties and interests other than tax bill owners or holders; provided, however, that any parties seeking relief other than an interest in or lien upon the real estate may continue with said suit to a final adjudication of such other issues; provided, further, an appeal may be had as to any claim attacking the validity of the tax bill or bills or the priorities as to payment of proceeds of foreclosure sale. If the parcel of real estate auctioned off at sheriff's foreclosure sale is sold for a sum greater than the total amount necessary to pay the principal amount of all tax bills included in the judgment, together with interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs, and such sale is confirmed by the court, and no appeal is taken by any person claiming any right, title or interest in or to or lien upon said parcel of real estate or by any person or taxing authority owning or holding or claiming any right, title or interest in or to any tax bills within the time fixed by law for the filing of notice of appeal, the court shall thereupon order the sheriff to make distribution to the owners or holders of the respective tax bills included in the judgment of the amounts found to be due and in the order of priorities. Thereafter all proceedings in the suit shall be ordered by the court to be dismissed as to such persons or taxing authorities owning, holding or claiming any right, title, or interest in any such tax bill or bills so paid, and the case shall proceed as to any parties claiming any right, title, or interest in or lien upon the parcel of real estate affected by such tax bill or bills as to their respective claims to such surplus funds then remaining in the hands of the sheriff.\n\n4. Whenever an answer is filed to the petition, as herein provided, a severance of the action as to all parcels of real estate affected by such answer shall be granted, and the issues raised by the petition and such answer shall be tried separate and apart from the other issues in the suit, but the granting of such severance shall not delay the trial or other disposition of any other issue in the case. A separate appeal may be taken from any action of the court affecting any right, title, or interest in or to, or lien upon, such real estate, other than issues of law and fact affecting the amount or validity of the lien of tax bills, but the proceeding to foreclose the lien of any tax bills shall not be stayed by such appeal. The trial shall be conducted by the court without the aid of a jury and the suit shall be in equity. This action shall take precedence over and shall be triable before any other action in equity affecting the title to such real estate, upon motion of any interested party.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 1029 § 23, A.L. 1949 p. 602, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1659 & 1116)",

After the judgment of foreclosure has been entered, or, after a motion for a new trial has been overruled, or, if an appeal be taken from such judgment and the judgment has been affirmed, after the sheriff shall have been notified by any party to the suit that such judgment has been affirmed on appeal and that the mandate of the appellate court is on file with the circuit clerk, there shall be a waiting period of six months before any advertisement of sheriff's sale shall be published.\n\n2.

A prospective bidder may make such a demonstration by presenting statements from the appropriate code enforcement officials of the municipality; and\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, any taxing authority or land bank agency shall be eligible to bid at the sale without making the demonstration described in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n4. Such sale shall convey the whole interest of every person having or claiming any right, title or interest in or lien upon such real estate, whether such person has answered or not, subject to rights-of-way thereon of public utilities upon which tax has been otherwise paid, and subject to the lien thereon, if any, of the United States of America.\n\n5. The collector shall advance the sums necessary to pay for the publication of all advertisements required by sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015 and shall be allowed credit therefor in the collector's accounts with the county. The collector shall give credit in such accounts for all such advances recovered by the collector.

Within six months after the sheriff sells any parcel of real estate, the court shall, upon its own motion or upon motion of any interested party, set the cause down for hearing to confirm or set aside the foreclosure sale thereof, even though such parcels are not all of the parcels of real estate described in the notice of sheriff's foreclosure sale. Notice of the hearing, or of the court moving to confirm the foreclosure sale, shall be sent by any interested party to each person who was sent notice of the sale and to any interested parties as required by prevailing notions of due process. At the time of such hearing, the sheriff shall make report of the sale, and the court shall hear evidence of the value of the property offered on behalf of any interested party to the suit, and shall forthwith determine whether an adequate consideration has been paid for each such parcel. The court's judgment shall include a specific finding that adequate notice was provided to all interested parties under prevailing notions of due process and sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015, reciting the notice efforts of the collector, sheriff, and tax sale purchaser. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to preclude a successful tax sale purchaser from asserting a claim to quiet title to the bid-upon parcel under section 527.150.\n\n2. For this purpose the court shall have power to summon any city or county official or any private person to testify as to the reasonable value of the property, and if the court finds that adequate consideration has been paid, the court shall confirm the sale and order the sheriff to issue a deed to the purchaser. If the court finds that the consideration paid is inadequate, the court shall confirm the sale if the purchaser increases the purchaser's bid to such amount as the court deems to be adequate and makes such additional payment, or if all tax bills included in the judgment, interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs then due thereon are not paid in full by one or more interested parties to the suit. If the court finds that the consideration is inadequate, but the purchaser declines to increase the purchaser's bid to such amount as the court deems adequate and make such additional payment, then the sale shall be disapproved if all tax bills included in the judgment, interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs then due thereon are paid in full by one or more interested parties to the suit, the lien of the judgment continued, and such parcel of real estate shall be again advertised and offered for sale by the sheriff to the highest bidder at public auction for cash at any subsequent sheriff's foreclosure sale. Unless the court requires evidence of the value of the property conveyed to land trust or a land bank agency, none shall be required, and the amount bid by the land trust or such land bank agency shall be deemed adequate consideration.\n\n3. If the sale is confirmed, the court shall order the proceeds of the sale applied in the following order:\n\n(1) To the payment of the costs of the publication of the notice of foreclosure and of the sheriff's foreclosure sale;\n\n(2) To the payment of all of the collector's and sheriff's costs including appraiser's fee and attorney's fees;\n\n(3) To the payment of all tax bills adjudged to be due in the order of their priority, including principal, interest and penalties thereon, except in the event of a sale to any land bank agency, for which this subdivision shall not apply.\n\n­­If, after such payment, there is any sum remaining of the proceeds of the sheriff's foreclosure sale, the court shall thereupon try and determine the other issues in the suit in accordance with section 141.480. If any answering parties have specially appealed as provided in section 141.570, the court shall retain the custody of such funds pending disposition of such appeal, and upon disposition of such appeal shall make such distribution. If there are not sufficient proceeds of the sale to pay all claims in any class described, the court shall order the same to be paid pro rata in accordance with the priorities.\n\n4. If there are any funds remaining of the proceeds after the sheriff's sale and after the distribution of such funds as herein set out and no person entitled to any such funds, whether or not a party to the suit, shall, within two years after such sale, appear and claim the funds, the funds shall be distributed to the appropriate taxing authorities, except in partial opt-in counties, where the funds shall be distributed to the school fund for the county.\n\n5. Any county operating under the provisions of sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015 may elect to allocate a portion of its share of the proceeds toward a fund for the purpose of defending against claims challenging the sufficiency of notice provisions under this section.\n\n6. Any interested party, other than the sheriff's sale purchaser, who moves the court to set aside a sheriff's sale after the issuance of a sheriff's deed made under the provisions of sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015 shall be required to pay into the court the redemption amount otherwise necessary under sections 141.420 and 141.530 prior to the court hearing any such motion to set aside.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 1029 § 28, A.L. 1949 p. 602, A.L. 1967 p. 224, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1351, et al., A.L. 2012 H.B. 1659 & 1116, A.L. 2024 H.B. 2062)",
