The \"Missouri Qualified Fuel Ethanol Producer Incentive Fund\" is hereby created and subject to appropriations shall be used to provide economic subsidies to Missouri qualified fuel ethanol producers pursuant to this section. The director of the department of agriculture shall administer the fund pursuant to this section.\n\n3. A Missouri qualified fuel ethanol producer shall be eligible for a monthly grant from the fund, except that a Missouri qualified fuel ethanol producer shall only be eligible for the grant for a total of sixty months unless such producer during those sixty months failed, due to a lack of appropriations, to receive the full amount from the fund for which they were eligible, in which case such producers shall continue to be eligible for up to twenty-four additional months or until they have received the maximum amount of funding for which they were eligible during the original sixty-month time period. The amount of the grant is determined by calculating the estimated gallons of qualified fuel ethanol production to be produced from Missouri agricultural products or qualified biomass for the succeeding calendar month, as certified by the department of agriculture, and applying such figure to the per-gallon incentive credit established in this subsection. Each Missouri qualified fuel ethanol producer shall be eligible for a total grant in any fiscal year equal to twenty cents per gallon for the first twelve and one-half million gallons of qualified fuel ethanol produced from Missouri agricultural products or qualified biomass in the fiscal year plus five cents per gallon for the next twelve and one-half million gallons of qualified fuel ethanol produced from Missouri agricultural products or qualified biomass in the fiscal year. All such qualified fuel ethanol produced by a Missouri qualified fuel ethanol producer in excess of twenty-five million gallons shall not be applied to the computation of a grant pursuant to this subsection. The department of agriculture shall pay all grants for a particular month by the fifteenth day after receipt and approval of the application described in subsection 4 of this section.

Each purchaser desiring to make an election under section 142.848 shall present evidence to the director that:\n\n(1) The applicant was a licensee in good standing under the predecessor motor fuel statute as to which the applicant remitted tax to the director; or\n\n(2) The applicant meets the financial responsibility and bonding requirements imposed by this chapter, which bond shall conform to the specific requirements of this section.\n\n2. The director may require a purchaser who pays the tax to a supplier to file with the director a surety bond payable to the state, upon which the purchaser is the obligor or other financial security, in an amount satisfactory to the director, calculated with a maximum of three times monthly potential tax payments with a maximum amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars for gasoline and diesel fuel separately. The director may require that the bond indemnify the director against the tax credits claimed by the suppliers pursuant to section 142.854.\n\n3. Each purchaser desiring to make an election in accordance with section 142.848 shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 2 of this section if the purchaser holds a valid distributor's license and meets the bonding requirements according to the law on the day prior to the effective date of sections 142.800 to 142.953. Upon January 1, 1999, each purchaser holding a valid distributor's license issued prior to January 1, 1999, may elect to become an eligible purchaser. Such purchaser shall have the option to provide bonding as provided for distributors in section 142.896.\n\n4. The director shall have the authority to rescind a purchaser's eligibility and election to defer motor fuel tax remittances for the failure to make timely tax-deferred payment of tax to a supplier pursuant to section 142.848, by sending written notice to all suppliers or publishing notice of the revocation. As a condition of restoring a purchaser's eligibility the director may require further assurance of the financial responsibility of the purchaser, including increasing the bond required up to the three times potential liability without regard to a maximum, or any other action that the director may reasonably require to ensure remittance of the motor fuel tax. Any person whose application is refused or eligibility cancelled by the director may seek review of the determination by the administrative hearing commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the administrative hearing commission shall not grant a stay.\n\n5.

The owners or operators of such motor vehicles, except plug-in electric hybrids, shall, in lieu of the tax imposed by section 142.803, pay an annual alternative fuel decal fee as follows: seventy-five dollars on each passenger motor vehicle, school bus as defined in section 301.010, and commercial motor vehicle with a licensed gross vehicle weight of eighteen thousand pounds or less; one hundred dollars on each motor vehicle with a licensed gross weight in excess of eighteen thousand pounds but not more than thirty-six thousand pounds used for farm or farming transportation operations and registered with a license plate designated with the letter \"F\"; one hundred fifty dollars on each motor vehicle with a licensed gross vehicle weight in excess of eighteen thousand pounds but less than or equal to thirty-six thousand pounds, and each passenger-carrying motor vehicle subject to the registration fee provided in sections 301.059, 301.061 and 301.063; two hundred fifty dollars on each motor vehicle with a licensed gross weight in excess of thirty-six thousand pounds used for farm or farming transportation operations and registered with a license plate designated with the letter \"F\"; and one thousand dollars on each motor vehicle with a licensed gross vehicle weight in excess of thirty-six thousand pounds. Owners or operators of plug-in electric hybrids shall pay one-half of the stated annual alternative fuel decal fee. Notwithstanding provisions of this section to the contrary, motor vehicles licensed as historic under section 301.131 which are powered by alternative fuel shall be exempt from both the tax imposed by this chapter and the alternative fuel decal requirements of this section. For the purposes of this section, a plug-in electric hybrid shall be any hybrid vehicle made by a manufacturer with a model year of 2018 or newer, that has not been modified from the original manufacturer specifications, with an internal combustion engine and batteries that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an electric power source.\n\n2.

Such decals shall be valid for a period of fifteen days from the date of issuance and shall be attached to the lower right-hand corner of the front windshield on the motor vehicle for which it was issued. Such decal and fee shall not be transferable. All proceeds from such decal fees shall be deposited as specified in section 142.345.

Owners or operators of compressed natural gas fueling stations or liquefied natural gas fueling stations whose vehicles bear an alternative fuel decal shall be prohibited from selling or providing compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas to any motor vehicle they do not own or operate. Owners or operators of motor vehicles powered by compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas bearing an alternative fuel decal after January 1, 2016, that decline to renew the alternative fuel decals for such motor vehicles shall no longer be eligible to apply for and use alternative fuel decals under this subsection.

An owner or operator of a motor vehicle powered by propane may continue to apply for and use the alternative fuel decal in lieu of paying the tax imposed under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of section 142.803. If the appropriate motor fuel tax under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of section 142.803 is collected at the time of fueling, an operator of a propane fueling station that uses quick-connect fueling nozzles may sell propane as a motor fuel without verifying the application of a valid Missouri alternative fuel decal. If an owner or operator of a motor vehicle powered by propane that bears an alternative fuel decal refuels at an unattended propane refueling station, such owner or operator shall not be eligible for a refund of the motor fuel tax paid at such refueling.\n\n6. The director shall annually, on or before January thirty-first of each year, collect or cause to be collected from owners or operators of the motor vehicles specified in subsection 1 of this section the annual decal fee. Applications for such decals shall be supplied by the department of revenue. In the case of a motor vehicle which is not in operation by January thirty-first of any year, a decal may be purchased for a fractional period of such year, and the amount of the decal fee shall be reduced by one-twelfth for each complete month which shall have elapsed since the beginning of such year. This subsection shall not apply to an owner or operator of a motor vehicle powered by propane who fuels such vehicle exclusively at unattended fueling stations that collect the motor fuel tax.\n\n7. Upon the payment of the fee required by subsection 1 of this section, the director shall issue a decal, which shall be valid for the current calendar year and shall be attached to the lower right-hand corner of the front windshield on the motor vehicle for which it was issued.\n\n8. The decal fee paid pursuant to subsection 1 of this section for each motor vehicle shall be transferable upon a change of ownership of the motor vehicle and, if the LP gas or natural gas equipment is removed from a motor vehicle upon a change of ownership and is reinstalled in another motor vehicle, upon such reinstallation.

It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle required to have an alternative fuel decal upon the highways of this state without a valid decal unless the motor vehicle is exclusively fueled at propane, compressed natural gas, or liquefied natural gas fueling stations that collect the motor fuel tax.\n\n10. No person shall cause to be put, or put, any alternative fuel into the fuel supply receptacle or battery of a motor vehicle required to have an alternative fuel decal unless the motor vehicle either has a valid decal attached to it or the appropriate motor fuel tax is collected at the time of such fueling.\n\n11.

Suppliers and permissive suppliers shall be required to post a bond of not less than three months' potential tax liability based on the number of gallons handled as estimated by the director, but in no event shall the bond be less than one hundred thousand dollars nor more than two million dollars. An applicant may alternatively show proof of financial responsibility acceptable to the director in the following amounts in lieu of posting of bond or in lieu of posting of the full amount of bond, which shall constitute evidence of financial responsibility in the absence of circumstances indicating the director is otherwise at risk with respect to collection of taxes from the applicant:\n\n(1) Proof of five million dollars net worth shall constitute evidence of financial responsibility in lieu of posting of bond;\n\n(2) Proof of two million five hundred thousand dollars net worth shall constitute financial responsibility in lieu of posting one-half of the bond; and\n\n(3) Proof of one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars net worth shall constitute financial responsibility in lieu of posting one-fourth of the bond. Net worth is calculated on a company, not individual state, basis.\n\n4. For the purpose of determining the amount of precollected motor fuel tax due, every supplier shall file with the director, on forms prescribed and furnished by the director, a verified statement. The director may require the reporting of any information reasonably necessary to determine the amount of precollected motor fuel tax due.\n\n5. The director may require every licensed supplier or permissive supplier to separately disclose and identify, in a written statement to the director with the supplier or permissive supplier report, any removal and sale from the bulk transfer/terminal system in another state by that supplier to a person other than a licensed supplier, permissive supplier or distributor of gallons of motor fuel, other than diesel fuel dyed in accordance with this chapter, and which gallons are destined for this state, as shown by the terminal-issued shipping paper, and as to which gallons the tax imposed by this chapter has not been collected or accrued by the supplier upon the removal.\n\n6.

If a distributor qualifies pursuant to subsection 3 of section 142.851 and was not required to have a bond posted pursuant to the predecessor act, then such distributor may elect to either post the bond as set out in this subsection or participate in a cash bond as set out below. The cash bond shall be held by the director in a \"Motor Fuel Bond Trust Fund\", which is hereby created, for the benefit of the participating distributors. The bond shall be used solely for the purpose of preventing a loss to the state for motor fuel taxes, surcharges and fees not paid. No distributor shall have any claim or rights against the fund as a separate person. Contributions to the fund will be made at the rate as defined in regulations promulgated by the director of the department of revenue. Contributions will be remitted by the participating distributors through the suppliers under the same procedures as set out for remitting of motor fuel taxes set out in this chapter. The director shall notify the suppliers of which distributors have elected to participate, when the contributions are required and when the fund has reached its maximum. At that time no further contributions will be required until the fund has been depleted to the minimum amount established by regulation, at which time the director shall notify the distributors and suppliers to resume contributions at the defined rate. In the event the director has made a demand for payment from a participating distributor in this fund, and such demand has not been satisfied within ninety days, the director shall use the cash bond to satisfy the delinquency.
