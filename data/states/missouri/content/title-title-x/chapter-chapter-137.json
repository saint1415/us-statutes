Definitions — revision of prior levy, when, procedure — calculation of state aid for public schools, taxing authority's duties. —1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"General reassessment\", changes in value, entered in the assessor's books, of a substantial portion of the parcels of real property within a county resulting wholly or partly from reappraisal of value or other actions of the assessor or county equalization body or ordered by the state tax commission or any court;\n\n(2)\"Tax rate\",\"rate\", or\"rate of levy\", singular or plural, includes the tax rate for each purpose of taxation of property a taxing authority is authorized to levy without a vote and any tax rate authorized by election, including bond interest and sinking fund;\n\n(3)\"Tax rate ceiling\", a tax rate as revised by the taxing authority to comply with the provisions of this section or when a court has determined the tax rate; except that, other provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, a school district may levy the operating levy for school purposes required for the current year pursuant to subsection 2 of section 163.021, less all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, if such tax rate does not exceed the highest tax rate in effect subsequent to the 1980 tax year. This is the maximum tax rate that may be levied, unless a higher tax rate ceiling is approved by voters of the political subdivision as provided in this section;\n\n(4)\"Tax revenue\", when referring to the previous year, means the actual receipts from ad valorem levies on all classes of property, including state-assessed property, in the immediately preceding fiscal year of the political subdivision, plus an allowance for taxes billed but not collected in the fiscal year and plus an additional allowance for the revenue which would have been collected from property which was annexed by such political subdivision but which was not previously used in determining tax revenue pursuant to this section. The term \"tax revenue\" shall not include any receipts from ad valorem levies on any property of a railroad corporation or a public utility, as these terms are defined in section 386.020, which were assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the previous year but are assessed by the state tax commission in the current year. All school districts and those counties levying sales taxes pursuant to chapter 67 shall include in the calculation of tax revenue an amount equivalent to that by which they reduced property tax levies as a result of sales tax pursuant to section 67.505 and section 164.013 or as excess home dock city or county fees as provided in subsection 4 of section 313.820 in the immediately preceding fiscal year but not including any amount calculated to adjust for prior years. For purposes of political subdivisions which were authorized to levy a tax in the prior year but which did not levy such tax or levied a reduced rate, the term \"tax revenue\", as used in relation to the revision of tax levies mandated by law, shall mean the revenues equal to the amount that would have been available if the voluntary rate reduction had not been made.\n\n2. Whenever changes in assessed valuation are entered in the assessor's books for any personal property, in the aggregate, or for any subclass of real property as such subclasses are established in Section 4(b) of Article X of the Missouri Constitution and defined in section 137.016, the county clerk in all counties and the assessor of St. Louis City shall notify each political subdivision wholly or partially within the county or St. Louis City of the change in valuation of each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, exclusive of new construction and improvements. All political subdivisions shall immediately revise the applicable rates of levy for each purpose for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, for which taxes are levied to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, exclusive of new construction and improvements, substantially the same amount of tax revenue as was produced in the previous year for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this section. Any political subdivision that has received approval from voters for a tax increase after August 27, 2008, may levy a rate to collect substantially the same amount of tax revenue as the amount of revenue that would have been derived by applying the voter-approved increased tax rate ceiling to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision as most recently certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law, except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this section. Such tax revenue shall not include any receipts from ad valorem levies on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property. Where the taxing authority is a school district for the purposes of revising the applicable rates of levy for each subclass of real property, the tax revenues from state-assessed railroad and utility property shall be apportioned and attributed to each subclass of real property based on the percentage of the total assessed valuation of the county that each subclass of real property represents in the current taxable year. As provided in Section 22 of Article X of the constitution, a political subdivision may also revise each levy to allow for inflationary assessment growth occurring within the political subdivision. The inflationary growth factor for any such subclass of real property or personal property shall be limited to the actual assessment growth in such subclass or class, exclusive of new construction and improvements, and exclusive of the assessed value on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property, but not to exceed the consumer price index or five percent, whichever is lower. Should the tax revenue of a political subdivision from the various tax rates determined in this subsection be different than the tax revenue that would have been determined from a single tax rate as calculated pursuant to the method of calculation in this subsection prior to January 1, 2003, then the political subdivision shall revise the tax rates of those subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, in which there is a tax rate reduction, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Such revision shall yield an amount equal to such difference and shall be apportioned among such subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, based on the relative assessed valuation of the class or subclasses of property experiencing a tax rate reduction. Such revision in the tax rates of each class or subclass shall be made by computing the percentage of current year adjusted assessed valuation of each class or subclass with a tax rate reduction to the total current year adjusted assessed valuation of the class or subclasses with a tax rate reduction, multiplying the resulting percentages by the revenue difference between the single rate calculation and the calculations pursuant to this subsection and dividing by the respective adjusted current year assessed valuation of each class or subclass to determine the adjustment to the rate to be levied upon each class or subclass of property. The adjustment computed herein shall be multiplied by one hundred, rounded to four decimals in the manner provided in this subsection, and added to the initial rate computed for each class or subclass of property. For school districts that levy separate tax rates on each subclass of real property and personal property in the aggregate, if voters approved a ballot before January 1, 2011, that presented separate stated tax rates to be applied to the different subclasses of real property and personal property in the aggregate, or increases the separate rates that may be levied on the different subclasses of real property and personal property in the aggregate by different amounts, the tax rate that shall be used for the single tax rate calculation shall be a blended rate, calculated in the manner provided under subdivision (1) of subsection 6 of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, no revision to the rate of levy for personal property shall cause such levy to increase over the levy for personal property from the prior year.\n\n3. (1) Where the taxing authority is a school district, it shall be required to revise the rates of levy to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, including state-assessed railroad and utility property, which shall be separately estimated in addition to other data required in complying with section 164.011, substantially the amount of tax revenue permitted in this section. In the year following tax rate reduction, the tax rate ceiling may be adjusted to offset such district's reduction in the apportionment of state school moneys due to its reduced tax rate. However, in the event any school district, in calculating a tax rate ceiling pursuant to this section, requiring the estimating of effects of state-assessed railroad and utility valuation or loss of state aid, discovers that the estimates used result in receipt of excess revenues, which would have required a lower rate if the actual information had been known, the school district shall reduce the tax rate ceiling in the following year to compensate for the excess receipts, and the recalculated rate shall become the tax rate ceiling for purposes of this section.\n\n(2) For any political subdivision which experiences a reduction in the amount of assessed valuation relating to a prior year, due to decisions of the state tax commission or a court pursuant to sections 138.430 to 138.433, or due to clerical errors or corrections in the calculation or recordation of any assessed valuation:\n\n(a) Such political subdivision may revise the tax rate ceiling for each purpose it levies taxes to compensate for the reduction in assessed value occurring after the political subdivision calculated the tax rate ceiling for the particular subclass of real property or for personal property, in the aggregate, in a prior year. Such revision by the political subdivision shall be made at the time of the next calculation of the tax rate for the particular subclass of real property or for personal property, in the aggregate, after the reduction in assessed valuation has been determined and shall be calculated in a manner that results in the revised tax rate ceiling being the same as it would have been had the corrected or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior calculation;\n\n(b) In addition, for up to three years following the determination of the reduction in assessed valuation as a result of circumstances defined in this subdivision, such political subdivision may levy a tax rate for each purpose it levies taxes above the revised tax rate ceiling provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to recoup any revenues it was entitled to receive had the corrected or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior calculation.\n\n4. (1) In order to implement the provisions of this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, the term improvements shall apply to both real and personal property. In order to determine the value of new construction and improvements, each county assessor shall maintain a record of real property valuations in such a manner as to identify each year the increase in valuation for each political subdivision in the county as a result of new construction and improvements. The value of new construction and improvements shall include the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which were begun after and were not part of the prior year's assessment, except that the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which had been totally or partially exempt from ad valorem taxes pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865, sections 135.200 to 135.255, and section 353.110 shall be included in the value of new construction and improvements when the property becomes totally or partially subject to assessment and payment of all ad valorem taxes. The aggregate increase in valuation of personal property for the current year over that of the previous year is the equivalent of the new construction and improvements factor for personal property. Notwithstanding any opt-out implemented pursuant to subsection 14**of section 137.115, the assessor shall certify the amount of new construction and improvements and the amount of assessed value on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property separately for each of the three subclasses of real property for each political subdivision to the county clerk in order that political subdivisions shall have this information for the purpose of calculating tax rates pursuant to this section and Section 22, Article X, Constitution of Missouri. In addition, the state tax commission shall certify each year to each county clerk the increase in the general price level as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the United States, or its successor publications, as defined and officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency. The state tax commission shall certify the increase in such index on the latest twelve-month basis available on February first of each year over the immediately preceding prior twelve-month period in order that political subdivisions shall have this information available in setting their tax rates according to law and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri. For purposes of implementing the provisions of this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Missouri Constitution, the term\"property\"means all taxable property, including state-assessed property.\n\n(2) Each political subdivision required to revise rates of levy pursuant to this section or Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri shall calculate each tax rate it is authorized to levy and, in establishing each tax rate, shall consider each provision for tax rate revision provided in this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, separately and without regard to annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67.505 and section 164.013. Each political subdivision shall set each tax rate it is authorized to levy using the calculation that produces the lowest tax rate ceiling. It is further the intent of the general assembly, pursuant to the authority of Section 10(c) of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, that the provisions of such section be applicable to tax rate revisions mandated pursuant to Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri as to reestablishing tax rates as revised in subsequent years, enforcement provisions, and other provisions not in conflict with Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri. Annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67.505 and section 164.013 shall be applied to the tax rate as established pursuant to this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, unless otherwise provided by law.\n\n5. (1) In all political subdivisions, the tax rate ceiling established pursuant to this section shall not be increased unless approved by a vote of the people. Approval of the higher tax rate shall be by at least a majority of votes cast. When a proposed higher tax rate requires approval by more than a simple majority pursuant to any provision of law or the constitution, the tax rate increase must receive approval by at least the majority required.\n\n(2) When voters approve an increase in the tax rate, the amount of the increase shall be added to the tax rate ceiling as calculated pursuant to this section to the extent the total rate does not exceed any maximum rate prescribed by law. If a ballot question presents a stated tax rate for approval rather than describing the amount of increase in the question, the stated tax rate approved shall be adjusted as provided in this section and, so adjusted, shall be the current tax rate ceiling. The increased tax rate ceiling as approved shall be adjusted such that when applied to the current total assessed valuation of the political subdivision, excluding new construction and improvements since the date of the election approving such increase, the revenue derived from the adjusted tax rate ceiling is equal to the sum of: the amount of revenue which would have been derived by applying the voter-approved increased tax rate ceiling to total assessed valuation of the political subdivision, as most recently certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law. Such adjusted tax rate ceiling may be applied to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision at the setting of the next tax rate. If a ballot question presents a phased-in tax rate increase, upon voter approval, each tax rate increase shall be adjusted in the manner prescribed in this section to yield the sum of: the amount of revenue that would be derived by applying such voter-approved increased rate to the total assessed valuation, as most recently certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase was approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law, from the date of the election to the time of such increase and, so adjusted, shall be the current tax rate ceiling.\n\n(3) The governing body of any political subdivision may levy a tax rate lower than its tax rate ceiling and may, in a nonreassessment year, increase that lowered tax rate to a level not exceeding the tax rate ceiling without voter approval in the manner provided under subdivision (4) of this subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a political subdivision from voluntarily levying a tax rate lower than that which is required under the provisions of this section or from seeking voter approval of a reduction to such political subdivision's tax rate ceiling.\n\n(4) In a year of general reassessment, a governing body whose tax rate is lower than its tax rate ceiling shall revise its tax rate pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4 of this section as if its tax rate was at the tax rate ceiling. In a year following general reassessment, if such governing body intends to increase its tax rate, the governing body shall conduct a public hearing, and in a public meeting it shall adopt an ordinance, resolution, or policy statement justifying its action prior to setting and certifying its tax rate. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which levies a tax rate lower than its tax rate ceiling solely due to a reduction required by law resulting from sales tax collections. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which has received voter approval for an increase to its tax rate ceiling subsequent to setting its most recent tax rate.\n\n6. (1) For the purposes of calculating state aid for public schools pursuant to section 163.031, each taxing authority which is a school district shall determine its proposed tax rate as a blended rate of the classes or subclasses of property. Such blended rate shall be calculated by first determining the total tax revenue of the property within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority, which amount shall be equal to the sum of the products of multiplying the assessed valuation of each class and subclass of property by the corresponding tax rate for such class or subclass, then dividing the total tax revenue by the total assessed valuation of the same jurisdiction, and then multiplying the resulting quotient by a factor of one hundred. Where the taxing authority is a school district, such blended rate shall also be used by such school district for calculating revenue from state-assessed railroad and utility property as defined in chapter 151 and for apportioning the tax rate by purpose.\n\n(2) Each taxing authority proposing to levy a tax rate in any year shall notify the clerk of the county commission in the county or counties where the tax rate applies of its tax rate ceiling and its proposed tax rate. Each taxing authority shall express its proposed tax rate in a fraction equal to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, unless its proposed tax rate is in excess of one dollar, then one/one-hundredth of a cent. If a taxing authority shall round to one/one-hundredth of a cent, it shall round up a fraction greater than or equal to five/one-thousandth of one cent to the next higher one/one-hundredth of a cent; if a taxing authority shall round to one-tenth of a cent, it shall round up a fraction greater than or equal to five/one-hundredths of a cent to the next higher one-tenth of a cent. Any taxing authority levying a property tax rate shall provide data, in such form as shall be prescribed by the state auditor by rule, substantiating such tax rate complies with Missouri law. All forms for the calculation of rates pursuant to this section shall be promulgated as a rule and shall not be incorporated by reference. The state auditor shall promulgate rules for any and all forms for the calculation of rates pursuant to this section which do not currently exist in rule form or that have been incorporated by reference. In addition, each taxing authority proposing to levy a tax rate for debt service shall provide data, in such form as shall be prescribed by the state auditor by rule, substantiating the tax rate for debt service complies with Missouri law. A tax rate proposed for annual debt service requirements will be prima facie valid if, after making the payment for which the tax was levied, bonds remain outstanding and the debt fund reserves do not exceed the following year's payments. The county clerk shall keep on file and available for public inspection all such information for a period of three years. The clerk shall, within three days of receipt, forward a copy of the notice of a taxing authority's tax rate ceiling and proposed tax rate and any substantiating data to the state auditor. The state auditor shall, within fifteen days of the date of receipt, examine such information and return to the county clerk his or her findings as to compliance of the tax rate ceiling with this section and as to compliance of any proposed tax rate for debt service with Missouri law. If the state auditor believes that a taxing authority's proposed tax rate does not comply with Missouri law, then the state auditor's findings shall include a recalculated tax rate, and the state auditor may request a taxing authority to submit documentation supporting such taxing authority's proposed tax rate. The county clerk shall immediately forward a copy of the auditor's findings to the taxing authority and shall file a copy of the findings with the information received from the taxing authority. The taxing authority shall have fifteen days from the date of receipt from the county clerk of the state auditor's findings and any request for supporting documentation to accept or reject in writing the rate change certified by the state auditor and to submit all requested information to the state auditor. A copy of the taxing authority's acceptance or rejection and any information submitted to the state auditor shall also be mailed to the county clerk. If a taxing authority rejects a rate change certified by the state auditor and the state auditor does not receive supporting information which justifies the taxing authority's original or any subsequent proposed tax rate, then the state auditor shall refer the perceived violations of such taxing authority to the attorney general's office and the attorney general is authorized to obtain injunctive relief to prevent the taxing authority from levying a violative tax rate.\n\n(3) In the event that the taxing authority incorrectly completes the forms created and promulgated under subdivision (2) of this subsection, or makes a clerical error, the taxing authority may submit amended forms with an explanation for the needed changes. If such amended forms are filed under regulations prescribed by the state auditor, the state auditor shall take into consideration such amended forms for the purposes of this subsection.\n\n7. No tax rate shall be extended on the tax rolls by the county clerk unless the political subdivision has complied with the foregoing provisions of this section.\n\n8. Whenever a taxpayer has cause to believe that a taxing authority has not complied with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer may make a formal complaint with the prosecuting attorney of the county. Where the prosecuting attorney fails to bring an action within ten days of the filing of the complaint, the taxpayer may bring a civil action pursuant to this section and institute an action as representative of a class of all taxpayers within a taxing authority if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, if there are questions of law or fact common to the class, if the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and if the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. In any class action maintained pursuant to this section, the court may direct to the members of the class a notice to be published at least once each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the civil action is commenced and in other counties within the jurisdiction of a taxing authority. The notice shall advise each member that the court will exclude him or her from the class if he or she so requests by a specified date, that the judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion, and that any member who does not request exclusion may, if he or she desires, enter an appearance. In any class action brought pursuant to this section, the court, in addition to the relief requested, shall assess against the taxing authority found to be in violation of this section the reasonable costs of bringing the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, provided no attorney's fees shall be awarded any attorney or association of attorneys who receive public funds from any source for their services. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall be set for hearing as soon as practicable after the cause is at issue.\n\n9. If in any action, including a class action, the court issues an order requiring a taxing authority to revise the tax rates as provided in this section or enjoins a taxing authority from the collection of a tax because of its failure to revise the rate of levy as provided in this section, any taxpayer paying his or her taxes when an improper rate is applied has erroneously paid his or her taxes in part, whether or not the taxes are paid under protest as provided in section 139.031 or otherwise contested. The part of the taxes paid erroneously is the difference in the amount produced by the original levy and the amount produced by the revised levy. The township or county collector of taxes or the collector of taxes in any city shall refund the amount of the tax erroneously paid. The taxing authority refusing to revise the rate of levy as provided in this section shall make available to the collector all funds necessary to make refunds pursuant to this subsection. No taxpayer shall receive any interest on any money erroneously paid by him or her pursuant to this subsection. Effective in the 1994 tax year, nothing in this section shall be construed to require a taxing authority to refund any tax erroneously paid prior to or during the third tax year preceding the current tax year.\n\n10. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2004, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 835 § 1, A.L. 1979 S.B. 247, et al., A.L. 1984 H.B. 1254, A.L. 1985 S.B. 234, A.L. 1985 H.B. 463, A.L. 1985 S.B. 152, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1022, et al., A.L. 1989 S.B. 110, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1817, A.L. 1991 H.B. 608, S.B. 432, A.L. 1992 S.B. 630, A.L. 1994 S.B. 676, A.L. 1996 S.B. 795, et al., A.L. 1999 H.B. 516, A.L. 2000 S.B. 894, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1150, et al., A.L. 2004 S.B. 960, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with H.B. 186 merged with H.B. 461 merged with S.B. 272, A.L. 2008 S.B. 711, A.L. 2011 H.B. 506, A.L. 2013 H.B. 1035)\n\n*Effective 10-11-13, see § 21.250.

The provisions of this subsection shall apply in those counties including any city not within a county in which the governing body has previously adopted or hereafter adopts the provisions of this subsection.\n\n2. The assessor may consider a property residentially occupied upon personal verification or when any two of the following conditions have been met:\n\n(1) An occupancy permit has been issued for the property;\n\n(2) A deed transferring ownership from one party to another has been filed with the recorder of deeds' office subsequent to the date of the first permanent utility service;\n\n(3) A utility company providing service in the county has verified a transfer of service for property from one party to another;\n\n(4) The person or persons occupying the newly constructed property has registered a change of address with any local, state or federal governmental office or agency.\n\n3. In implementing the provisions of this section, the assessor may use occupancy permits, building permits, warranty deeds, utility connection documents, including telephone connections, or other official documents as may be necessary to discover the existence of newly constructed properties. No utility company shall refuse to provide verification monthly to the assessor of a utility connection to a newly occupied single family building or structure.\n\n4. In the event that the assessment under subsections 1 and 2 of this section is not completed until after the deadline for filing appeals in a given tax year, the owner of the newly constructed property who is aggrieved by the assessment of the property may appeal this assessment the following year to the county board of equalization in accordance with chapter 138 and may pay any taxes under protest in accordance with section 139.031; provided however, that such payment under protest shall not be required as a condition of appealing to the county board of equalization. The collector shall impound such protested taxes and shall not disburse such taxes until resolution of the appeal.\n\n5. The increase in assessed valuation resulting from the implementation of the provisions of this section shall be considered new construction and improvements under the provisions of this chapter.\n\n6. In counties which adopt the provisions of subsections 1 to 7 of this section, an amount not to exceed ten percent of all ad valorem property tax collections on newly constructed and occupied residential property allocable to each taxing authority within counties of the first classification having a population of nine hundred thousand or more, one-tenth of one percent of all ad valorem property tax collections allocable to each taxing authority within all other counties of the first classification and one-fifth of one percent of all ad valorem property tax collections allocable to each taxing authority within counties of the second, third and fourth classifications and any county of the first classification having a population of at least eighty-two thousand inhabitants, but less than eighty-two thousand one hundred inhabitants, in addition to the amount prescribed by section 137.720 shall be deposited into the assessment fund of the county for collection costs.\n\n7. For purposes of figuring the tax due on such newly constructed residential property, the assessor or the board of equalization shall place the full amount of the assessed valuation on the tax book upon the first day of the month following occupancy. Such assessed valuation shall be taxed for each month of the year following such date at its new assessed valuation, and for each month of the year preceding such date at its previous valuation. The percentage derived from dividing the number of months at which the property is taxed at its new valuation by twelve shall be applied to the total assessed valuation of the new construction and improvements, and such product shall be included in the next year's base for the purposes of figuring the next year's tax levy rollback. The untaxed percentage shall be considered as new construction and improvements in the following year and shall be exempt from the rollback provisions.\n\n8. Subsections 1 to 7 of this section shall be effective in those counties including any city not within a county in which the governing body of such county elects to adopt a proposal to implement the provisions of subsections 1 to 7 of this section. Such subsections shall become effective in such county on the first day of January of the year following such election.\n\n9. In any county which adopts the provisions of subsections 1 to 7 of this section prior to the first day of June in any year pursuant to subsection 8 of this section, the assessor of such county shall, upon application of the property owner, remove on a pro rata basis from the tax book for the current year any residential real property improvements destroyed by a natural disaster if such property is unoccupied and uninhabitable due to such destruction. On or after the first day of July, the board of equalization shall perform such duties. Any person claiming such destroyed property shall provide a list of such destroyed property to the county assessor. The assessor shall have available a supply of appropriate forms on which the claim shall be made. The assessor may verify all such destroyed property listed to ensure that the person made a correct statement. Any person who completes such a list and, with intent to defraud, includes property on the list that was not destroyed by a natural disaster shall, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be assessed double the value of any property fraudulently listed. The list shall be filed by the assessor, after he has provided a copy of the list to the county collector and the board of equalization, in the office of the county clerk who, after entering the filing thereof, shall preserve and safely keep them. If the assessor, subsequent to such destruction, considers such property occupied as provided in subsection 2 of this section, the assessor shall consider such property new construction and improvements and shall assess such property accordingly as provided in subsection 1 of this section. For the purposes of this section, the term\"natural disaster\"means any disaster due to natural causes such as tornado, fire, flood, or earthquake.\n\n10. Any political subdivision may recover the loss of revenue caused by subsection 9 of this section by adjusting the rate of taxation, to the extent previously authorized by the voters of such political subdivision, for the tax year immediately following the year of such destruction in an amount not to exceed the loss of revenue caused by this section.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 181 & 633 § 2, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1817, A.L. 1994 S.B. 662 & 459, A.L. 1995 H.B. 211, A.L. 2003 S.B. 120, A.L. 2008 S.B. 711, A.L. 2011 H.B. 506)",

Deferred maintenance includes the maintenance, repair or replacement of the following:\n\n(1) Broken floor joists, missing sections or collapsed interior floors;\n\n(2) Improperly installed or collapsing partitions, loose or missing plaster;\n\n(3) Broken or missing sash, frames or window panes;\n\n(4) Inadequate light or ventilation;\n\n(5) Missing or defective weather stripping or storm windows;\n\n(6) Missing or broken doors;\n\n(7) Collapsed or broken stairs, stairways or stair railings;\n\n(8) Missing or inoperative sanitary facilities;\n\n(9) Hazardous gas or electric installations;\n\n(10) Leaking sinks or defective drainboards;\n\n(11) Improperly installed, obstructed, broken or leaking piping, drains, vents or traps;\n\n(12) Inoperative or obsolete heating plant;\n\n(13) Electrical insulation missing or damaged, overloaded electrical circuits, improper electrical installations or connections;\n\n(14) Split or buckled basement support beams, open breaks or severe settlement in basement walls;\n\n(15) Inadequate exterior wall and attic insulation;\n\n(16) Open cracks or breaks in exterior building walls;\n\n(17) Holes or cracks through roof, defective roof flashing or skylights;\n\n(18) Collapsing or deteriorating chimneys;\n\n(19) Broken or missing gutters and downspouts;\n\n(20) Rotted fascia boards, eaves, soffits and cornices;\n\n(21) Collapsed or broken porch joists, columns or railings;\n\n(22) Rotted or broken porch flooring;\n\n(23) Missing or broken step treads; and\n\n(24) Exterior or interior paint.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 214 § 1, A.L. 1983 S.B. 63, et al., A.L. 1985 S.B. 152)\n\nEffective 12-31-85",

In making assessments of real property as required by the provisions of section 137.115, and in order to provide for the renovation of obsolete properties as authorized by Section 7 of Article X of the Missouri Constitution, the county assessor shall not, for a period of five years after a deferred maintenance activity has been begun, add to the assessed value of a dwelling consisting of any number of residential units, regardless of the classification of the real property for assessment purposes, any additional assessed value because of deferred maintenance which has been begun upon such property during the period prescribed in section 137.113; except that, before any county assessor shall refrain from adding additional assessed valuation because of a deferred maintenance activity he shall determine that the property in question is on the tax rolls of the county and that no delinquent taxes on such property are due.\n\n2. To be eligible for the tax relief afforded by subsection 1 of this section, a dwelling must be located on real property within an area satisfying the description set forth in Section 7 of Article X of the Missouri Constitution. The governing body of each unit of local government of this state shall designate such areas within its boundaries by resolution, order, or ordinance, and each such resolution, order, or ordinance shall indicate the length of time the designation is to exist. Within thirty days of the date such resolution, order, or ordinance is passed, the unit of local government shall provide the assessor of the county or the city not within a county in which the designated area lies, a certified copy of the resolution, order, or ordinance designating the area and a map of the area so designated clearly showing the boundaries of the area, as well as all the streets lying within the area. Each unit of local government which designates an area for the tax relief set forth in subsection 1 of this section shall establish a procedure whereby any person may apply to the unit of local government, or an agency thereof, for certification that a designated dwelling lies within an area duly designated for such tax relief. This certification shall also specify the items of deferred maintenance completed on the dwelling. Within twenty days after the issuance of such a certificate, the unit of local government shall transmit to the assessor of the county or city not within a county in which the real property lies a copy of the certificate. Upon receipt of such certificate, the assessor shall determine whether the property in question is eligible for the assessment postponement provided for in subsection 1 of this section and shall issue to the owner of the real property a formal declaration of whether such tax relief is to be made available, and, if so, also indicating the assessed valuation of the real property immediately prior to the deferred maintenance and the term of the assessment postponement. As used in this subsection, the phrase\"unit of local government\"shall mean the municipality within whose boundaries the area to be designated lies. If the area does not lie within the boundaries of any municipality, then\"unit of local government\"shall mean the county within whose boundaries the area to be designated lies.\n\n(L. 1977 S.B. 214 § 3, A.L. 1983 S.B. 63, et al., A.L. 1985 S.B. 152)\n\nEffective 12-31-85",

Real and personal property, assessment — classes of property, assessment — physical inspection required, when, procedure — opt-out provision — mine property assessment. —1. All other laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the assessor or the assessor's deputies in all counties of this state including the City of St. Louis shall annually make a list of all real and tangible personal property taxable in the assessor's city, county, town or district. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of this section and section 137.078, the assessor shall annually assess all personal property at thirty-three and one-third percent of its true value in money as of January first of each calendar year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property, including any new construction and improvements to real property, and possessory interests in real property at the percent of its true value in money set in subsection 5 of this section. The true value in money of any possessory interest in real property in subclass (3), where such real property is on or lies within the ultimate airport boundary as shown by a federal airport layout plan, as defined by 14 CFR 151.5, of a commercial airport having a FAR Part 139 certification and owned by a political subdivision, shall be the otherwise applicable true value in money of any such possessory interest in real property, less the total dollar amount of costs paid by a party, other than the political subdivision, towards any new construction or improvements on such real property completed after January 1, 2008, and which are included in the above-mentioned possessory interest, regardless of the year in which such costs were incurred or whether such costs were considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property in the following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January first of each odd-numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same assessed values shall apply in the following even-numbered year, except for new construction and property improvements which shall be valued as though they had been completed as of January first of the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place of doing business, or residence of each person required by this chapter to list property, and require the person to make a correct statement of all taxable tangible personal property owned by the person or under his or her care, charge or management, taxable in the county. On or before January first of each even-numbered year, the assessor shall prepare and submit a two-year assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state tax commission for their respective approval or modification. The county governing body shall approve and forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first. If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered approved by the county governing body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan and if the state tax commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750, the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first, to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear, convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally accepted appraisal techniques; and\n\n(2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word\"comparable\"means that:\n\n(a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and\n\n(b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property, except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred square feet in size of the disputed property, and resemble the disputed property in age, floor plan, number of rooms, and other relevant characteristics.\n\n2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal property assessment forms through the mail.\n\n3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at the following percentages of their true value in money:\n\n(1) Grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, one-half of one percent;\n\n(2) Livestock, twelve percent;\n\n(3) Farm machinery, twelve percent;\n\n(4) Motor vehicles which are eligible for registration as and are registered as historic motor vehicles pursuant to section 301.131 and aircraft which are at least twenty-five years old and which are used solely for noncommercial purposes and are operated less than two hundred hours per year or aircraft that are home built from a kit, five percent;\n\n(5) Poultry, twelve percent;\n\n(6) Tools and equipment used for pollution control and tools and equipment used in retooling for the purpose of introducing new product lines or used for making improvements to existing products by any company which is located in a state enterprise zone and which is identified by any standard industrial classification number cited in subdivision (7) of section 135.200, twenty-five percent; and\n\n(7) Solar panels, racking systems, inverters, and related solar equipment, components, materials, and supplies installed in connection with solar photovoltaic energy systems, as described in subdivision (46) of subsection 2 of section 144.030, that were constructed and producing solar energy prior to August 9, 2022, five percent.\n\n4. The person listing the property shall enter a true and correct statement of the property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out, shall be signed and either affirmed or sworn to as provided in section 137.155. The list shall then be delivered to the assessor.\n\n5. (1) All subclasses of real property, as such subclasses are established in Section 4(b) of Article X of the Missouri Constitution and defined in section 137.016, shall be assessed at the following percentages of true value:\n\n(a) For real property in subclass (1), nineteen percent;\n\n(b) For real property in subclass (2), twelve percent; and\n\n(c) For real property in subclass (3), thirty-two percent.\n\n(2) A taxpayer may apply to the county assessor, or, if not located within a county, then the assessor of such city, for the reclassification of such taxpayer's real property if the use or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified, he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.\n\n6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books, and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner may be considered real property.\n\n7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of section 442.015 and assessed as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel.\n\n8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.\n\n9. The assessor of each county and each city not within a county shall use a nationally recognized automotive trade publication such as the National Automobile Dealers' Association Official Used Car Guide, Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, or other similar publication as the recommended guide of information for determining the true value of motor vehicles described in such publication. The state tax commission shall select and make available to all assessors which publication shall be used. The assessor of each county and each city not within a county shall use the trade-in value published in the current October issue of the publication selected by the state tax commission. The assessor shall not use a value that is greater than the average trade-in value in determining the true value of the motor vehicle without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. For vehicles two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than average without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such information or publications that, in the assessor's judgment, will fairly estimate the true value in money of the motor vehicle. For motor vehicles with a true value of less than fifty thousand dollars as of January 1, 2025, the assessor shall not assess such motor vehicle for an amount greater than such motor vehicle was assessed in the previous year, provided that such motor vehicle was properly assessed in the previous year.\n\n10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of such property.\n\n11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.\n\n12. A physical inspection, as required by subsection 10 of this section, shall include, but not be limited to, an on-site personal observation and review of all exterior portions of the land and any buildings and improvements to which the inspector has or may reasonably and lawfully gain external access, and shall include an observation and review of the interior of any buildings or improvements on the property upon the timely request of the owner pursuant to subsection 11 of this section. Mere observation of the property via a drive-by inspection or the like shall not be considered sufficient to constitute a physical inspection as required by this section.\n\n13. A county or city collector may accept credit cards as proper form of payment of outstanding property tax or license due. No county or city collector may charge surcharge for payment by credit card which exceeds the fee or surcharge charged by the credit card bank, processor, or issuer for its service. A county or city collector may accept payment by electronic transfers of funds in payment of any tax or license and charge the person making such payment a fee equal to the fee charged the county by the bank, processor, or issuer of such electronic payment.\n\n14. Any county or city not within a county in this state may, by an affirmative vote of the governing body of such county, opt out of the provisions of this section and sections 137.073, 138.060, and 138.100 as enacted by house bill no. 1150 of the ninety-first general assembly, second regular session and section 137.073 as modified by house committee substitute for senate substitute for senate committee substitute for senate bill no. 960, ninety-second general assembly, second regular session, for the next year of the general reassessment, prior to January first of any year. No county or city not within a county shall exercise this opt-out provision after implementing the provisions of this section and sections 137.073, 138.060, and 138.100 as enacted by house bill no. 1150 of the ninety-first general assembly, second regular session and section 137.073 as modified by house committee substitute for senate substitute for senate committee substitute for senate bill no. 960, ninety-second general assembly, second regular session, in a year of general reassessment. For the purposes of applying the provisions of this subsection, a political subdivision contained within two or more counties where at least one of such counties has opted out and at least one of such counties has not opted out shall calculate a single tax rate as in effect prior to the enactment of house bill no. 1150 of the ninety-first general assembly, second regular session. A governing body of a city not within a county or a county that has opted out under the provisions of this subsection may choose to implement the provisions of this section and sections 137.073, 138.060, and 138.100 as enacted by house bill no. 1150 of the ninety-first general assembly, second regular session, and section 137.073 as modified by house committee substitute for senate substitute for senate committee substitute for senate bill no. 960, ninety-second general assembly, second regular session, for the next year of general reassessment, by an affirmative vote of the governing body prior to December thirty-first of any year.\n\n15. The governing body of any city of the third classification with more than twenty-six thousand three hundred but fewer than twenty-six thousand seven hundred inhabitants located in any county that has exercised its authority to opt out under subsection 14 of this section may levy separate and differing tax rates for real and personal property only if such city bills and collects its own property taxes or satisfies the entire cost of the billing and collection of such separate and differing tax rates. Such separate and differing rates shall not exceed such city's tax rate ceiling.\n\n16. Any portion of real property that is available as reserve for strip, surface, or coal mining for minerals for purposes of excavation for future use or sale to others that has not been bonded and permitted under chapter 444 shall be assessed based upon how the real property is currently being used. Any information provided to a county assessor, state tax commission, state agency, or political subdivision responsible for the administration of tax policies shall, in the performance of its duties, make available all books, records, and information requested, except such books, records, and information as are by law declared confidential in nature, including individually identifiable information regarding a specific taxpayer or taxpayer's mine property. For purposes of this subsection,\"mine property\"shall mean all real property that is in use or readily available as a reserve for strip, surface, or coal mining for minerals for purposes of excavation for current or future use or sale to others that has been bonded and permitted under chapter 444.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 10950, A.L. 1945 P. 1782 § 10, A.L. 1951 p. 852, A.L. 1959 H.B. 108, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1175, A.L. 1973 H.B. 592, A.L. 1981 S.B. 13, A.L. 1983 S.B. 63, et al., A.L. 1985 S.B. 234, A.L. 1985 S.B. 152, A.L. 1986 S.B. 476, A.L. 1987 H.B. 909 merged with H.B. 384 Revision, A.L. 1989 H.B. 181 & 633 merged with S.B. 148, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1817, A.L. 1991 H.B. 608 merged with S.B. 432, H.B. 25, A.L. 1992 S.B. 630, A.L. 1998 S.B. 535 merged with S.B. 827, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1150, et al. § 137.115 and § 1, A.L. 2003 H.B. 57, A.L. 2004 S.B. 960 merged with S.B. 1394, A.L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with S.B. 210 merged with S.B. 267, A.L. 2007 S.B. 22, A.L. 2008 H.B. 2058 merged with S.B. 711 merged with S.B. 718, A.L. 2010 S.B. 630, A.L. 2013 H.B. 1035, A.L. 2016 H.B. 2381, A.L. 2018 S.B. 627 & 925, A.L. 2020 S.B. 676, A.L. 2021 S.B. 153 & 97, A.L. 2025 H.B. 199 merged with S.B. 4)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 9756; 1919 § 12766; 1909 § 11348\n\nEffective 8-28-25 (S.B. 4); 1-01-26 (H.B. 199)\n\n(2005) Characteristics of potential owner of property, such as possession of casino license, are irrelevant to determining value of property at highest and best use; therefore, applying standard for casino real property which differs from other commercial properties is valuation subclass in violation of section and Article X, Section 4(b), Constitution of Missouri.

As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Business personal property\", tangible personal property which is used in a trade or business or used for production of income and which has a determinable life of longer than one year except that supplies used by a business shall also be considered business personal property, but shall not include livestock, farm machinery, grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, property subject to the motor vehicle registration provisions of chapter 301, property assessed under section 137.078, the property of rural electric cooperatives under chapter 394, or property assessed by the state tax commission under chapters 151, 153, and 155, section 137.022, and sections 137.1000 to 137.1030;\n\n(2)\"Class life\", the class life of property as set out in the federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System life tables or their successors under the Internal Revenue Code as amended;\n\n(3)\"Economic or functional obsolescence\", a loss in value of personal property above and beyond physical deterioration and age of the property. Such loss may be the result of economic or functional obsolescence or both;\n\n(4)\"Original cost\", the price the current owner, the taxpayer, paid for the item without freight, installation, or sales or use tax. In the case of acquisition of items of personal property as part of an acquisition of an entity, the original cost shall be the historical cost of those assets remaining in place and in use and the placed-in-service date shall be the date of acquisition by the entity being acquired;\n\n(5)\"Placed in service\", property is placed in service when it is ready and available for a specific use, whether in a business activity, an income-producing activity, a tax-exempt activity, or a personal activity. Even if the property is not being used, the property is in service when it is ready and available for its specific use;\n\n(6)\"Recovery period\", the period over which the original cost of depreciable tangible personal property shall be depreciated for property tax purposes and shall be the same as the recovery period allowed for such property under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n2. To establish uniformity in the assessment of depreciable tangible personal property, each assessor shall use the standardized schedule of depreciation in this section to determine the assessed valuation of depreciable tangible personal property for the purpose of estimating the value of such property subject to taxation under this chapter.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, and to estimate the value of depreciable tangible personal property for mass appraisal purposes, each assessor shall value depreciable tangible personal property by applying the class life and recovery period to the original cost of the property according to the following depreciation schedule. The percentage shown for the first year shall be the percentage of the original cost used for January first of the year following the year of acquisition of the property, and the percentage shown for each succeeding year shall be the percentage of the original cost used for January first of the respective succeeding year as follows:\n\n­­Depreciable tangible personal property in all recovery periods shall continue in subsequent years to have the depreciation factor last listed in the appropriate column so long as it is owned or held by the taxpayer. The state tax commission shall study and analyze the values established by this method of assessment and in every odd-numbered year make recommendations to the joint committee on tax policy pertaining to any changes in this methodology, if any, that are warranted.\n\n4. Such estimate of value determined under this section shall be presumed to be correct for the purpose of determining the true value in money of the depreciable tangible personal property, but such estimation may be disproved by substantial and persuasive evidence of the true value in money under any method determined by the state tax commission to be correct, including, but not limited to, an appraisal of the tangible personal property specifically utilizing generally accepted appraisal techniques, and contained in a narrative appraisal report in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice or by proof of economic or functional obsolescence or evidence of excessive physical deterioration. For purposes of appeal of the provisions of this section, the salvage or scrap value of depreciable tangible personal property may only be considered if the property is not in use as of the assessment date.\n\n5. This section shall not apply to business personal property placed in service before January 2, 2006. Nothing in this section shall create a presumption as to the proper method of determining the assessed valuation of business personal property placed in service before January 2, 2006.\n\n6. The provisions of this section are not intended to modify the definition of tangible personal property as defined in section 137.010.\n\n(L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with H.B. 461 merged with S.B. 210, A.L. 2008 S.B. 711)",

In all cases where any person, company or corporation may hereafter divide any tract of land into parcels less than one-sixteenth part of a section or otherwise, in such manner that such parcels cannot be described in the usual manner of describing lands in accordance with the surveys made by the general government, it shall be the duty of such person, company or corporation to cause such lands to be surveyed and a plat thereof made by a surveyor in the county where such lands are situated, which plat shall particularly describe and set forth the lots or parcels of land surveyed, as aforesaid; the lots and blocks shall be numbered in progressive numbers, and the plats shall show the number, location and quantity of land in each lot, and the description of the tract of land so divided; provided, that whenever it shall appear to the county commission of the county in which any such tracts are situated that tracts or parcels of land less than one-sixteenth of a section, and lying outside of the limits of any incorporated city, town or village, have been conveyed without having been surveyed and platted and the plat thereof recorded as herein provided, the commission may require the county surveyor, by order of record, to survey and plat such tract or tracts of land and record the plat so made, all of which shall be done at the expense of the owner of such tracts of land at the time the survey is made.\n\n2. And when any tracts of land lying within the limits of any city, town or village cannot be described by lot or block number, or other description given in a recorded plat, the city council may have such tracts of land surveyed and platted by the city or county surveyor, or other competent surveyor.

Said plat shall be certified to by the surveyor and recorded in like manner as the plats of towns are required to be certified to and recorded. The description of real estate in any deed or conveyance, or for the purpose of taxation, in accordance with the number and description set forth in the plat aforesaid, shall be deemed a good and valid description of the lot or parcel of lands so described.\n\n3. Said surveyor shall file in the office of the clerk of the county commission of the county, in which any such lots or tracts of land platted under the provisions of this law are situated, his report and copy of such survey and tracts or lots platted under the provisions of this section, with the statements of the costs of such survey and platting, and the recorder's fee for recording same, which shall be paid by the surveyor, with an apportionment of the same, against each tract thus surveyed and platted, and the commission at the next term thereafter shall levy the amount of such costs as a tax against such tracts as thus apportioned and certified to by the surveyor, and shall cause the same to be entered upon the tax books against the several tracts and collected as other taxes are collected. And when said taxes are thus collected the county commission shall cause a warrant to be drawn for the amount of such collections to the surveyor making said plat and cause same to be paid to him accordingly.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 10988, A.L. 1945 p. 1782 § 42)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 9797; 1919 § 12807; 1909 § 11389",

five percent per year or the percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whichever is greater, and for zero percent counties, the real property tax liability on an eligible taxpayer's homestead shall not be increased above the liability incurred during the initial credit year. For all counties, an eligible taxpayer's real property tax liability shall be increased to reflect any increase in tax liability derived from any new property tax levy or an increase in an existing property tax levy approved by the voters subsequent to an eligible taxpayer's initial credit year, provided that, for five percent counties, such increase shall not be considered for the purposes of calculating the allowable increase in an eligible taxpayer's real property tax liability as provided in this subdivision;\n\n(4)\"Eligible taxpayer\", a Missouri resident who:\n\n(a) Is an owner of record of a homestead or has a legal or equitable interest in such property as evidenced by a written instrument; and\n\n(b) Is liable for the payment of real property taxes on such homestead;\n\n(5)\"Homestead\", real property actually occupied by an eligible taxpayer as the primary residence.

By no later than the municipal election in April 2026, a county shall place on the ballot a question of whether to grant a property tax credit pursuant to this section to eligible taxpayers residing in such county in an amount equal to the taxpayer's eligible credit amount. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the proposal, then the credit shall be in effect and the county shall grant such property tax credit to eligible taxpayers residing in such county in an amount equal to the taxpayer's eligible credit amount.\n\n3. (1) A county granting a credit pursuant to this section shall apply such credit when calculating the eligible taxpayer's property tax liability for the tax year. The amount of the credit shall be noted on the statement of tax due sent to the eligible taxpayer by the county collector. The county governing body may adopt reasonable procedures in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this section, provided that the county shall not adopt any procedure that limits the definition or scope of eligible credit amount or eligible taxpayer as defined in this section.\n\n(2) If an eligible taxpayer makes new construction and improvements to such eligible taxpayer's homestead, the real property tax liability for the taxpayer's initial credit year shall be increased to reflect the real property tax liability attributable to such new construction and improvements.\n\n(3) If an eligible taxpayer's homestead is annexed into a taxing jurisdiction to which such eligible taxpayer did not owe real property tax in the eligible taxpayer's initial credit year, then the real property tax liability for the taxpayer's initial credit year shall be increased to reflect the real property tax liability owed to the annexing taxing jurisdiction.\n\n4. For the purposes of calculating property tax levies pursuant to section 137.073, the total amount of credits authorized by a county pursuant to this section shall be considered tax revenue, as such term is defined in section 137.073, actually received.\n\n5. A county granting a tax credit pursuant to this section shall notify each political subdivision within such county of the total credit amount applicable to such political subdivision by no later than November thirtieth of each year.\n\n6. No taxpayer shall be authorized to claim a property tax credit pursuant to this section and section 137.1050 for the same homestead.\n\n(L. 2025 1st. Ex. Sess.
