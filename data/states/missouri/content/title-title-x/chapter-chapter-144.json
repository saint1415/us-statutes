Imposition of tax — seller's duties — modification of taxable status of tangible personal property or services, notification of sellers, when, manner. —1. The purpose and intent of sections 144.010 to 144.510 is to impose a tax upon the privilege of engaging in the business, in this state, of selling tangible personal property and those services listed in section 144.020 and for the privilege of titling new and used motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors purchased or acquired for use on the highways or waters of this state which are required to be registered under the laws of the state of Missouri.

Excluding subdivision (9) of subsection 1 of section 144.020 and sections 144.070, 144.440 and 144.450, the extent to which a seller is required to collect the tax from the purchaser of the taxable property or service is governed by section 144.285 and in no way affects sections 144.080 and 144.100, which require all sellers to report to the director of revenue their\"gross receipts\", defined herein to mean the aggregate amount of the sales price of all sales at retail, and remit tax at four percent of their gross receipts.\n\n2.

At the time the owner of any new or used motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor which was acquired in a transaction subject to sales tax under the Missouri sales tax law makes application to the director of revenue for an official certificate of title and the registration of the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor as otherwise provided by law, the owner shall present to the director of revenue evidence satisfactory to the director of revenue showing the purchase price exclusive of any charge incident to the extension of credit paid by or charged to the applicant in the acquisition of the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor, or that no sales tax was incurred in its acquisition, and if sales tax was incurred in its acquisition, the applicant shall pay or cause to be paid to the director of revenue the sales tax provided by the Missouri sales tax law in addition to the registration fees now or hereafter required according to law, and the director of revenue shall not issue a certificate of title for any new or used motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor subject to sales tax as provided in the Missouri sales tax law until the tax levied for the sale of the same under sections 144.010 to 144.510 has been paid as provided in this section or is registered under the provisions of subsection 5 of this section.\n\n2. As used in subsection 1 of this section, the term\"purchase price\"shall mean the total amount of the contract price agreed upon between the seller and the applicant in the acquisition of the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor, regardless of the medium of payment therefor.\n\n3. In the event that the purchase price is unknown or undisclosed, or that the evidence thereof is not satisfactory to the director of revenue, the same shall be fixed by appraisement by the director.\n\n4. The director of the department of revenue shall endorse upon the official certificate of title issued by the director upon such application an entry showing that such sales tax has been paid or that the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor represented by such certificate is exempt from sales tax and state the ground for such exemption.\n\n5. Any person, company, or corporation engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors, which are to be used exclusively for rental or lease purposes, and not for resale, may apply to the director of revenue for authority to operate as a leasing or rental company and pay an annual fee of two hundred fifty dollars for such authority. Any company approved by the director of revenue may pay the tax due on any motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor as required in section 144.020 at the time of registration thereof or in lieu thereof may pay a sales tax as provided in sections 144.010, 144.020, 144.070 and 144.440. A sales tax shall be charged to and paid by a leasing company which does not exercise the option of paying in accordance with section 144.020, on the amount charged for each rental or lease agreement while the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor is domiciled in this state. Any motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor which is leased as the result of a contract executed in this state shall be presumed to be domiciled in this state.\n\n6. Every applicant to be a registered fleet owner as described in subsections 6 to 10 of section 301.032 shall furnish with the application to operate as a registered fleet owner a corporate surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit, as defined in section 400.5-102, issued by any state or federal financial institution in the penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars, on a form approved by the department. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be conditioned upon the registered fleet owner complying with the provisions of any statutes applicable to registered fleet owners, and the bond shall be an indemnity for any loss sustained by reason of the acts of the person bonded when such acts constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the registered fleet owner license. The bond shall be executed in the name of the state of Missouri for the benefit of all aggrieved parties or the irrevocable letter of credit shall name the state of Missouri as the beneficiary; except that, the aggregate liability of the surety or financial institution to the aggrieved parties shall, in no event, exceed the amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit. The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be paid upon receipt by the department of a final judgment from a Missouri court of competent jurisdiction against the principal and in favor of an aggrieved party.\n\n7. Any corporation may have one or more of its divisions separately apply to the director of revenue for authorization to operate as a leasing company, provided that the corporation:\n\n(1) Has filed a written consent with the director authorizing any of its divisions to apply for such authority;\n\n(2) Is authorized to do business in Missouri;\n\n(3) Has agreed to treat any sale of a motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor from one of its divisions to another of its divisions as a sale at retail;\n\n(4) Has registered under the fictitious name provisions of sections 417.200 to 417.230 each of its divisions doing business in Missouri as a leasing company; and\n\n(5) Operates each of its divisions on a basis separate from each of its other divisions. However, when the transfer of a motor vehicle, trailer, boat or outboard motor occurs within a corporation which holds a license to operate as a motor vehicle or boat dealer pursuant to sections 301.550 to 301.573 the provisions in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall not apply.\n\n8. If the owner of any motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor desires to charge and collect sales tax as provided in this section, the owner shall make application to the director of revenue for a permit to operate as a motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor leasing company. The director of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations determining the qualifications of such a company, and the method of collection and reporting of sales tax charged and collected. Such regulations shall apply only to owners of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors, electing to qualify as motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor leasing companies under the provisions of subsection 5 of this section, and no motor vehicle renting or leasing, trailer renting or leasing, or boat or outboard motor renting or leasing company can come under sections 144.010, 144.020, 144.070 and 144.440 unless all motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors held for renting and leasing are included.\n\n9. Any person, company, or corporation engaged in the business of renting or leasing three thousand five hundred or more motor vehicles which are to be used exclusively for rental or leasing purposes and not for resale, and that has applied to the director of revenue for authority to operate as a leasing company may also operate as a registered fleet owner as prescribed in section 301.032.\n\n10. Beginning July 1, 2010, any motor vehicle dealer licensed under section 301.560 engaged in the business of selling motor vehicles or trailers shall apply to the director of revenue for authority to collect and remit the sales tax required under this section on all motor vehicles sold by the motor vehicle dealer. A motor vehicle dealer receiving authority to collect and remit the tax is subject to all provisions under sections 144.010 to 144.525. Any motor vehicle dealer authorized to collect and remit sales taxes on motor vehicles under this subsection shall be entitled to deduct and retain an amount equal to two percent of the motor vehicle sales tax pursuant to section 144.140. Any amount of the tax collected under this subsection that is retained by a motor vehicle dealer pursuant to section 144.140 shall not constitute state revenue. In no event shall revenues from the general revenue fund or any other state fund be utilized to compensate motor vehicle dealers for their role in collecting and remitting sales taxes on motor vehicles. In the event this subsection or any portion thereof is held to violate Article IV, Section 30(b) of the Missouri Constitution, no motor vehicle dealer shall be authorized to collect and remit sales taxes on motor vehicles under this section. No motor vehicle dealer shall seek compensation from the state of Missouri or its agencies if a court of competent jurisdiction declares that the retention of two percent of the motor vehicle sales tax is unconstitutional and orders the return of such revenues.\n\n11. (1) Every motor vehicle dealer licensed under section 301.560, as soon as technologically possible following the development and maintenance of a modernized, integrated system for the titling of vehicles, issuance and renewal of vehicle registrations, issuance and renewal of driver's licenses and identification cards, and perfection and release of liens and encumbrances on vehicles, to be funded by the motor vehicle administration technology fund as created in section 301.558, shall collect and remit the sales tax required under this section on all motor vehicles that such dealer sells. In collecting and remitting this sales tax, motor vehicle dealers shall be subject to all applicable provisions under sections 144.010 to 144.527.\n\n(2) The director of revenue may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this subsection shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This subsection and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 11412, A.L. 1941 p. 698, A.L. 1943 p. 1012, A.L. 1945 p. 1865, A.L. 1947 V.

The person shall be responsible not only for the collection of the amount of the tax imposed on the sale or service to the extent possible under the provisions of section 144.285, but shall file a return with the director of revenue showing the person's gross receipts and the amount of tax levied in section 144.020 for the preceding filing period, and shall remit to the director of revenue, with the return, the taxes levied in section 144.020 as provided in subsections 2 to 4 of this section.

Retail sales license required for all collectors of tax — prerequisite to issuance of city or county occupation license — prerequisite for sales at retail — statement of no tax due required. —1. The director of revenue shall require all persons who are responsible for the collection of taxes under the provisions of section 144.080 to procure a retail sales license at no cost to the licensee which shall be prominently displayed at the licensee's place of business, and the license is valid until revoked by the director or surrendered by the person to whom issued when sales are discontinued. The director shall issue the retail sales license within ten working days following the receipt of a properly completed application. Any person applying for a retail sales license or reinstatement of a revoked sales tax license who owes any tax under sections 144.010 to 144.510 or sections 143.191 to 143.261 must pay the amount due plus interest and penalties before the department may issue the applicant a license or reinstate the revoked license. All persons beginning business subsequent to August 13, 1986, and who are required to collect the sales tax shall secure a retail sales license prior to making sales at retail. Such license may, after ten days' notice, be revoked by the director of revenue only in the event the licensee shall be in default for a period of sixty days in the payment of any taxes levied under section 144.020 or sections 143.191 to 143.261. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057 in the event of revocation, the director of revenue may publish the status of the business account including the date of revocation in a manner as determined by the director.\n\n2. The possession of a retail sales license and a statement from the department of revenue that the licensee owes no tax due under sections 144.010 to 144.510 or sections 143.191 to 143.261 shall be a prerequisite to the issuance or renewal of any city or county occupation license or any state license which is required for conducting any business where goods are sold at retail. The date of issuance on the statement that the licensee owes no tax due shall be no more than ninety days before the date of submission for application or renewal of the local license. The revocation of a retailer's license by the director shall render the occupational license or the state license null and void.\n\n3. No person responsible for the collection of taxes under section 144.080 shall make sales at retail unless such person is the holder of a valid retail sales license. After all appeals have been exhausted, the director of revenue may notify the county or city law enforcement agency representing the area in which the former licensee's business is located that the retail sales license of such person has been revoked, and that any county or city occupation license of such person is also revoked. The county or city may enforce the provisions of this section, and may prohibit further sales at retail by such person.\n\n4. In addition to the provisions of subsection 2 of this section, beginning January 1, 2009, the possession of a statement from the department of revenue stating no tax is due under sections 143.191 to 143.265 or sections 144.010 to 144.510 shall also be a prerequisite to the issuance or renewal of any city or county occupation license or any state license required for conducting any business where goods are sold at retail.

The director of revenue, by regulation, may require a seller to timely remit the unpaid state sales tax for each quarter-monthly period, only if the seller's aggregate state sales tax was ten thousand dollars or more in each of at least six months during the prior twelve months. The term\"state sales tax\"as used in this section means the tax imposed by sections 144.010 to 144.510 and the additional sales tax imposed by Sections 43(a) to 43(c) and 47(a) to 47(c) of Article IV of the Missouri Constitution and does not include any sales taxes imposed by political subdivisions of the state pursuant to other provisions of law.\n\n2. The director may increase the monthly requirement to more than ten thousand dollars or otherwise narrow the application of the quarter-monthly remittance system authorized by this section. The director may not require the remittance of state sales taxes more often than monthly unless authorized by this section.\n\n3.

The unpaid amount shall be after a reduction for the compensation provided by section 144.140. The unpaid amount at the end of a quarter-monthly period shall not include unpaid amounts for a prior quarter-monthly period only if the seller made a remittance with respect to the prior quarter-monthly period.

(1) The penalty with respect to any quarter-monthly period shall not be imposed if the seller's timely remittance for the quarter-monthly period equals or exceeds one-fourth of the average monthly state sales tax liability of the seller for the preceding calendar year. The month of highest liability and the month of lowest liability shall be excluded in computing the average. This subdivision shall apply only to a seller who had a state sales tax liability for at least six months of the previous calendar year.\n\n(2) The penalty shall not be imposed if the seller establishes that the failure to make a timely remittance of at least ninety percent was due to reasonable cause, and not due to willful neglect.\n\n(3) The penalty shall not be imposed against any seller for the first two months the seller is obligated to make quarter-monthly remittance of state sales taxes.\n\n8.

The director of revenue may require retail sales licensees in default in filing a return and paying their taxes when due to file a bond in an amount to be determined by the director, which may be a corporate surety bond or a cash bond, but such bond shall not be more than two times the average monthly tax liability of the taxpayer based on the previous twelve months' experience. At such time as the director of revenue shall deem the amount of a bond required by this section to be insufficient to cover the average monthly tax liability of a given taxpayer, he or she may require such taxpayer to adjust the amount of the bond to the level satisfactory to the director which will cover the amount of such liability. The director shall, after a reasonable period of satisfactory tax compliance for one year from the initial date of bonding, release such taxpayer from the bonding requirement as set forth in this section. All itinerant or temporary businesses shall be required to procure the license and post the bond required under the provisions of sections 144.083 and 144.087 prior to the selling of goods at retail, and in the event that such business is to be conducted for less than one month, the amount of the bond shall be determined by the director.\n\n2.

If a tax has been incorrectly computed by reason of a clerical error or mistake on the part of the director of revenue, such fact shall be set forth in the records of the director of revenue, and the amount of the overpayment shall be credited on any taxes then due from the person legally obligated to remit the tax under chapter 144, and the balance shall be refunded to the person legally obligated to remit the tax, such person's administrators or executors, as provided for in section 144.200.\n\n2. If any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected, or has been erroneously or illegally computed, such sum shall be credited on any taxes then due from the person legally obligated to remit the tax under chapter 144, and the balance, with interest as determined by section 32.065, shall be refunded to the person legally obligated to remit the tax, but no such credit or refund shall be allowed unless duplicate copies of a claim for refund are filed within ten years from date of overpayment.\n\n3.

In the event that a tax has been illegally imposed against a person legally obligated to remit the tax, the director of revenue shall authorize the cancellation of the tax upon the director's record.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, a purchaser that originally paid sales or use tax to a vendor or seller may submit a refund claim directly to the director of revenue for such sales or use taxes paid to such vendor or seller and remitted to the director, provided no sum shall be refunded more than once, any such claim shall be subject to any offset, defense, or other claim the director otherwise would have against either the purchaser or vendor or seller, and such claim for refund is accompanied by either:\n\n(1) A notarized assignment of rights statement by the vendor or seller to the purchaser allowing the purchaser to seek the refund on behalf of the vendor or seller. An assignment of rights statement shall contain the Missouri sales or use tax registration number of the vendor or seller, a list of the transactions covered by the assignment, the tax periods and location for which the original sale was reported to the director of revenue by the vendor or seller, and a notarized statement signed by the vendor or seller affirming that the vendor or seller has not received a refund or credit, will not apply for a refund or credit of the tax collected on any transactions covered by the assignment, and authorizes the director to amend the seller's return to reflect the refund; or\n\n(2) In the event the vendor or seller fails or refuses to provide an assignment of rights statement within sixty days from the date of such purchaser's written request to the vendor or seller, or the purchaser is not able to locate the vendor or seller or the vendor or seller is no longer in business, the purchaser may provide the director a notarized statement confirming the efforts that have been made to obtain an assignment of rights from the vendor or seller. Such statement shall contain a list of the transactions covered by the assignment, the tax periods and location for which the original sale was reported to the director of revenue by the vendor or seller.\n\n­­The director shall not require such vendor, seller, or purchaser to submit amended returns for refund claims submitted under the provisions of this subsection. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, if the seller is registered with the director for collection and remittance of sales tax, the director shall notify the seller at the seller's last known address of the claim for refund. If the seller objects to the refund within thirty days of the date of the notice, the director shall not pay the refund. If the seller agrees that the refund is warranted or fails to respond within thirty days, the director may issue the refund and amend the seller's return to reflect the refund. For purposes of section 32.069, the refund claim shall not be considered to have been filed until the seller agrees that the refund is warranted or thirty days after the date the director notified the seller and the seller failed to respond.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, when a vendor files a refund claim on behalf of a purchaser and such refund claim is denied by the director, notice of such denial and the reason for the denial shall be sent by the director to the vendor and each purchaser whose name and address is submitted with the refund claim form filed by the vendor. A purchaser shall be entitled to appeal the denial of the refund claim within sixty days of the date such notice of denial is mailed by the director as provided in section 144.261. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all refund claims filed after August 28, 2012. The provisions of this subsection allowing a purchaser to appeal the director's decision to deny a refund claim shall also apply to any refund claim denied by the director on or after January 1, 2007, if an appeal of the denial of the refund claim is filed by the purchaser no later than September 28, 2012, and if such claim is based solely on the issue of the exemption of the electronic transmission or delivery of computer software.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the director of revenue shall authorize direct-pay agreements to purchasers which have annual purchases in excess of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the director of revenue. For the purposes of such direct-pay agreements, the taxes authorized under chapters 66, 67, 70, 92, 94, 162, 190, 238, 321, and 644 shall be remitted based upon the location of the place of business of the purchaser.\n\n7. Special rules applicable to error corrections requested by customers of mobile telecommunications service are as follows:\n\n(1) For purposes of this subsection, the terms \"customer\", \"home service provider\", \"place of primary use\", \"electronic database\", and \"enhanced zip code\" shall have the same meanings as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act incorporated by reference in section 144.013;\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if a customer of mobile telecommunications services believes that the amount of tax, the assignment of place of primary use or the taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider, in writing, within three years from the date of the billing statement. The customer shall include in such written notification the street address for the customer's place of primary use, the account name and number for which the customer seeks a correction of the tax assignment, a description of the error asserted by the customer and any other information the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request;\n\n(3) Within sixty days of receiving the customer's notice, the home service provider shall review its records and the electronic database or enhanced zip code to determine the customer's correct taxing jurisdiction. If the home service provider determines that the review shows that the amount of tax, assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is in error, the home service provider shall correct the error and, at its election, either refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected to the customer for a period of up to three years from the last day of the home service provider's sixty-day review period. If the home service provider determines that the review shows that the amount of tax, the assignment of place of primary use or the taxing jurisdiction is correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation of its determination to the customer.\n\n8. For all refund claims submitted to the department of revenue on or after September 1, 2003, notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if a person legally obligated to remit the tax levied under chapter 144 has received a refund of such taxes for a specific issue and submits a subsequent claim for refund of such taxes on the same issue for a tax period beginning on or after the date the original refund check issued to such person, no refund shall be allowed. This subsection shall not apply and a refund shall be allowed if the refund claim is filed by a purchaser under the provisions of subsection 4 of this section, the refund claim is for use tax remitted by the purchaser, or an additional refund claim is filed by a person legally obligated to remit the tax due to any of the following:\n\n(1) Receipt of additional information or an exemption certificate from the purchaser of the item at issue;\n\n(2) A decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or the administrative hearing commission; or\n\n(3) Changes in regulations or policy by the department of revenue.\n\n9. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the director of revenue shall respond to a request for a binding letter ruling filed in accordance with section 536.021 within sixty days of receipt of such request. If the director of revenue fails to respond to such letter ruling request within sixty days of receipt by the director, the director of revenue shall be barred from pursuing collection of any assessment of sales or use tax with respect to the issue which is the subject of the letter ruling request. For purposes of this subsection, the term\"letter ruling\"means a written interpretation of law by the director to a specific set of facts provided by a specific taxpayer or his or her agent.\n\n10. If any tax was paid more than once, was incorrectly collected, or was incorrectly computed, such sum shall be credited on any taxes then due from the person legally obligated to remit the tax under chapter 144 against any deficiency or tax due discovered through an audit of the person by the department of revenue through adjustment during the same tax filing period for which the audit applied.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 11432, A.L. 1941 p. 698, A.L. 1943 p. 1012, A.L. 1945 p. 1865, A.L. 1979 S.B. 218, et al., A.L. 1986 S.B. 669, et al., A.L. 1988 S.B. 586, A.L. 1991 H.B. 219, A.L. 1999 H.B. 139, A.L. 2001 H.B. 816, A.L. 2002 H.B. 1890, A.L. 2003 H.B. 600, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1504, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1435, A.L. 2019 S.B. 87)",

In order to permit sellers required to collect and report the sales tax to collect the amount required to be reported and remitted, but not to change the requirements of reporting or remitting tax or to serve as a levy of the tax, and in order to avoid fractions of pennies, the director of revenue shall establish brackets, showing the amounts of tax to be collected on sales of specified amounts, which shall be applicable to all taxable transactions.\n\n2. In all instances where statements covering taxable purchases are rendered to the taxpayer on a monthly or other periodic basis, the amount of tax shall be determined by applying the applicable tax rate to the taxable purchases represented on the statement, rounded to the nearest whole cent, or by application of the brackets established by the director of revenue, at the option of the retail vendor.\n\n3. No vendor or seller shall knowingly charge or receive from a purchaser as a sales tax any sum in excess of the sums provided for in this section.\n\n4. A vendor may, at his option, determine the amount charged to and received from each purchaser by use of a formula which applies the applicable tax rate to each taxable purchase, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

The unpaid balance due along with penalties and interest shall be similarly prorated among the state and all local jurisdictions for which tax was due during the filing period for which an underpayment occurs.

In any case in which any assessment of tax, interest, additions to tax or penalty imposed under sections 144.010 to 144.510 has been made and has become final, the director of revenue may file for record in the recorder's office of any county in which the taxpayer owing such tax, interest, additions to tax or penalty resides, owns property or has a place of business a certificate of lien specifying the amount of the tax, additions to tax, interest or penalty due and the name of the person liable for the same. Included in the assessment, the director shall notify the taxpayer of the department's intent to file prior to the filing of such certificate. Such notification shall contain an explanation of the taxpayer's right to protest or contest such proposed assessment. The director shall within twenty days after filing such certificate notify the taxpayer by first class mail postage prepaid.\n\n(1) The lien shall arise on the date such assessment becomes final and shall be continuing and shall attach to real or personal property or interest in real or personal property owned by the taxpayer or acquired in any manner by the taxpayer after the filing of the certificate of lien. Unless sooner released or discharged, the lien shall expire ten years after the certificate of lien was filed, unless within such ten-year period, the certificate of lien has been refiled by the director of revenue with the recorder. Unless sooner released or discharged, a timely refiled certificate of lien shall be treated as if filed on the date of filing of the original certificate of lien and shall expire ten years after the refiling. A certificate of lien may not be refiled more than one time.\n\n(2) If any taxpayer fails to pay any tax, interest, additions to tax or penalties imposed by sections 144.010 to 144.525 when due and the assessment for which has become final, the director may file for record in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of any county in which the taxpayer resides, or has a place of business, or owns property, a certificate of lien specifying the amount of the tax, interest, additions to tax and penalties due and the name of the liable taxpayer. The clerk of the circuit court shall file such certificate and enter it in the record of the circuit court for judgments and decrees under the procedure prescribed for filing transcripts of judgments. If the taxpayer does not reside, have a place of business or own property in the state of Missouri, the director may file for record a certificate of delinquency in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of Cole County. From the time of the filing of the certificate of lien or certificate of delinquency with the clerk of the circuit court, the amount of the tax, interest, additions to tax and penalties specified therein shall have the full force and effect of a default judgment of the circuit court until satisfied. Execution shall issue at the request of the director of revenue or his agent as is provided in the case of other judgments. No exemption shall be allowed from the levy of an execution issued for such delinquent tax, interest, additions to tax or penalties and no bond shall be required of the director of revenue, his agent or of the sheriff before making the levy.\n\n(3) The remedies in this subsection are cumulative and in addition to other collection methods given the director of revenue. No action taken shall be construed as an election on the part of the state or any of its officers to pursue any remedy or action hereunder to the exclusion of any other remedy or action for which provision is made.\n\n(4) If any certificate of lien has been erroneously or improvidently filed, the taxpayer or any other person affected by the lien may notify the director of revenue. The taxpayer or other affected person shall provide the director with the reasons the filing of the certificate of lien is erroneous or improvident as to such person (including that the affected person's name or other identification is similar to the taxpayer's) and a list of creditors with current addresses who are affected by the department's action. Upon receipt of the creditor list, reasons and verification of the erroneous or improvident filing, the director shall release the lien as to the taxpayer or the affected person, as necessary, and notify all creditors, stating the certificate of lien was filed erroneously or improvidently. If the certificate of lien was erroneously or improvidently filed after August 13, 1987, the director shall forthwith make a determination in writing which shall become a public record in the same place the certificate of lien is noted under subsection 5 of this section that the same be expunged from the record and give written notice thereof, duly certified, by certified mail to the recorder of deeds in the county where the same is recorded and upon receipt by the recorder of deeds of the certification the recorder shall immediately cause such record to be expunged. The director shall take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the lien is expunged. The director shall pay a three-dollar fee charged by the recorder when an erroneously or improvidently filed lien is expunged.\n\n2. The lien imposed under subsection 1 of this section may be wholly or partly released by filing for record in the office of the county recorder a release thereof executed by the director of revenue upon payment of the tax, interest, additions to tax and penalties or upon receipt by the director of revenue of security sufficient to secure payment thereof, or by final judgment holding such certificate of lien to have been erroneously or improvidently imposed.\n\n3. The director may release any part of the property subject to the lien by filing with the county recorder a copy of the original lien document and an affidavit containing a legal description of the property and stating that the property is to be released from the lien. The county recorder shall note the partial release in the same manner as provided in section 443.090. The release of any specific property shall not affect in any manner other property subject to lien.\n\n4. Each county recorder shall receive a fee of three dollars which shall be charged for the filing of each certificate of lien and a fee of one dollar and fifty cents for each release of lien filed for record. Such amounts shall be paid to the county recorder from funds appropriated to the department of revenue for that purpose. The county recorder shall be reimbursed by presenting a statement, showing the number of certificates and releases filed, to the department of revenue each calendar quarter. The department of revenue is authorized to collect an additional penalty from each taxpayer equal to the cost of filing a certificate of lien or release of lien with respect to such taxpayer.\n\n5. The director of revenue shall establish and maintain records for all certificates of lien filed under this section. The director shall also maintain records of all releases of lien filed under this section. The provisions of section 32.057 to the contrary notwithstanding, the records prepared by the director under this section, to the extent such information is or may be on file with the recorder, shall be open to public inspection. Such records established and maintained by the director shall not be the official record and are not conclusive evidence of any liability of any taxpayer to this state.\n\n6. If any action is taken by the director under the provisions of this chapter; including, but not limited to, section 144.425, to alter or abate any assessment upon which a judgment has been filed under the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, the director is authorized to file a modification or satisfaction of such judgment.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 11435, A.L. 1941 p. 698, A.L. 1943 p. 1012, A.L. 1945 p. 1865, A.L. 1985 H.B. 320, H.B. 717 & 741, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1335, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1155)",

No class action shall be brought against a marketplace facilitator in any court in this state on behalf of purchasers arising from or in any way related to an overpayment of use tax collected on retail sales facilitated by a marketplace facilitator, regardless of whether that claim is characterized as a tax refund claim. Nothing in this subsection shall affect a purchaser's right to seek a refund as provided under section 144.190.\n\n9. The department may promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section.
