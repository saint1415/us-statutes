Definitions. —As used in sections 135.010 to 135.030 the following words and terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Claimant\", a person or persons claiming a credit under sections 135.010 to 135.030. If the persons are eligible to file a joint federal income tax return and reside at the same address at any time during the taxable year, then the credit may only be allowed if claimed on a combined Missouri income tax return or a combined claim return reporting their combined incomes and property taxes. A claimant shall not be allowed a property tax credit unless the claimant or spouse has attained the age of sixty-five on or before the last day of the calendar year and the claimant or spouse was a resident of Missouri for the entire year, or the claimant or spouse is a veteran of any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States or this state who became one hundred percent disabled as a result of such service, or the claimant or spouse is disabled as defined in subdivision (2) of this section, and such claimant or spouse provides proof of such disability in such form and manner, and at such times, as the director of revenue may require, or if the claimant has reached the age of sixty on or before the last day of the calendar year and such claimant received surviving spouse Social Security benefits during the calendar year and the claimant provides proof, as required by the director of revenue, that the claimant received surviving spouse Social Security benefits during the calendar year for which the credit will be claimed. A claimant shall not be allowed a property tax credit if the claimant filed a valid claim for a credit under section 137.106*in the year following the year for which the property tax credit is claimed. The residency requirement shall be deemed to have been fulfilled for the purpose of determining the eligibility of a surviving spouse for a property tax credit if a person of the age of sixty-five years or older who would have otherwise met the requirements for a property tax credit dies before the last day of the calendar year. The residency requirement shall also be deemed to have been fulfilled for the purpose of determining the eligibility of a claimant who would have otherwise met the requirements for a property tax credit but who dies before the last day of the calendar year;\n\n(2)\"Disabled\", the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months. A claimant shall not be required to be gainfully employed prior to such disability to qualify for a property tax credit;\n\n(3)\"Gross rent\", amount paid by a claimant to a landlord for the rental, at arm's length, of a homestead during the calendar year, exclusive of charges for health and personal care services and food furnished as part of the rental agreement, whether or not expressly set out in the rental agreement. If the director of revenue determines that the landlord and tenant have not dealt at arm's length, and that the gross rent is excessive, then he shall determine the gross rent based upon a reasonable amount of rent. Gross rent shall be deemed to be paid only if actually paid prior to the date a return is filed. The director of revenue may prescribe regulations requiring a return of information by a landlord receiving rent, certifying for a calendar year the amount of gross rent received from a tenant claiming a property tax credit and shall, by regulation, provide a method for certification by the claimant of the amount of gross rent paid for any calendar year for which a claim is made. The regulations authorized by this subdivision may require a landlord or a tenant or both to provide data relating to health and personal care services and to food. Neither a landlord nor a tenant may be required to provide data relating to utilities, furniture, home furnishings or appliances;\n\n(4)\"Homestead\", the dwelling in Missouri owned or rented by the claimant and not to exceed five acres of land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for use of the dwelling as a home. It may consist of part of a multidwelling or multipurpose building and part of the land upon which it is built.\"Owned\"includes a vendee in possession under a land contract and one or more tenants by the entireties, joint tenants, or tenants in common and includes a claimant actually in possession if he was the immediate former owner of record, if a lineal descendant is presently the owner of record, and if the claimant actually pays all taxes upon the property. It may include a mobile home;\n\n(5)\"Income\", Missouri adjusted gross income as defined in section 143.121 less two thousand dollars for all calendar years ending on or before December 31, 2025, or in the case of a homestead owned and occupied, for the entire year, by the claimant, less four thousand dollars as an exemption for the claimant's spouse residing at the same address for all calendar years ending on or before December 31, 2025, or for all calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, less two thousand eight hundred dollars, or in the case of a homestead owned and occupied, for the entire year, by the claimant, less five thousand eight hundred dollars, as an exemption for the claimant's spouse residing at the same address; and increased, where necessary, to reflect the following:\n\n(a) Social Security, railroad retirement, and veterans payments and benefits unless the claimant is a one hundred percent service-connected, disabled veteran or a spouse of a one hundred percent service-connected, disabled veteran. The one hundred percent service-connected disabled veteran shall not be required to list veterans payments and benefits;\n\n(b) The total amount of all other public and private pensions and annuities;\n\n(c) Public relief, public assistance, and unemployment benefits received in cash, other than benefits received under this chapter;\n\n(d) No deduction being allowed for losses not incurred in a trade or business;\n\n(e) Interest on the obligations of the United States, any state, or any of their subdivisions and instrumentalities;\n\n(6)\"Property taxes accrued\", property taxes paid, exclusive of special assessments, penalties, interest, and charges for service levied on a claimant's homestead in any calendar year. Property taxes shall qualify for the credit only if actually paid prior to the date a return is filed. The director of revenue shall require a tax receipt or other proof of property tax payment. If a homestead is owned only partially by claimant, then property taxes accrued is that part of property taxes levied on the homestead which was actually paid by the claimant. For purposes of this subdivision, property taxes are\"levied\"when the tax roll is delivered to the director of revenue for collection. If a claimant owns a homestead part of the preceding calendar year and rents it or a different homestead for part of the same year, property taxes accrued means only taxes levied on the homestead both owned and occupied by the claimant, multiplied by the percentage of twelve months that such property was owned and occupied as the homestead of the claimant during the year. When a claimant owns and occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year, property taxes accrued shall be the sum of taxes allocable to those several properties occupied by the claimant as a homestead for the year. If a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit such as a farm, or multipurpose or multidwelling building, property taxes accrued shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of the homestead is of the total value. For purposes of this subdivision\"unit\"refers to the parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of which the homestead is a part;\n\n(7)\"Rent constituting property taxes accrued\", twenty percent of the gross rent paid by a claimant and spouse in the calendar year.\n\n(L. 1973 H.B. 149, et al. § 1, A.L. 1975 H.B. 121, et al., A.L. 1979 S.B. 247, et al., A.L. 1983 S.B. 47 & 29, A.L. 1988 S.B. 555, A.L. 1992 S.B. 797 merged with H.B. 1434 & 1490, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1745, A.L. 1996 H.B. 1098, A.L. 1998 S.B. 675, et al., A.L. 2005 H.B. 58 merged with H.B. 186 merged with H.B. 229 merged with H.B. 461, A.L. 2008 S.B. 711, A.L. 2025 H.B. 594 & 508)\n\n*Section 137.106 was repealed by S.B. 975 & 1024 Revision, 2018.",

Tax credit for new or expanded business facility — computation — maximum years and amount allowed — no credit allowed a public utility and certain businesses — definitions. —1. Any taxpayer who shall establish a new business facility shall be allowed a credit, each year for ten years, in an amount determined pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of this section, whichever is applicable, against the tax imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or an insurance company which shall establish a new business facility by satisfying the requirements in subdivision (9) of section 135.100 shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise imposed by chapter 148, and in the case of an insurance company exempt from the thirty percent employee requirement of section 135.230, against any obligation imposed pursuant to section 375.916, except that no taxpayer shall be entitled to multiple ten-year periods for subsequent expansions at the same facility, except as otherwise provided in this section. For the purpose of this section, the term\"facility\"shall mean, and be limited to, the facility or facilities which are located on the same site in which the new business facility is located, and in which the business conducted at such facility or facilities is directly related to the business conducted at the new business facility. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a taxpayer may be entitled to an additional ten-year period, and an additional six-year period after the expiration of such additional ten-year period, if a new business facility is expanded in the eighth, ninth or tenth year of the current ten-year period or in subsequent years following the expiration of the ten-year period, if the number of new business facility employees attributed to such expansion is at least twenty-five and the amount of new business facility investment attributed to such expansion is at least one million dollars. Credits may not be carried forward but shall be claimed for the taxable year during which commencement of commercial operations occurs at such new business facility, and for each of the nine succeeding taxable years. A letter of intent, as provided for in section 135.258, must be filed with the department of economic development no later than fifteen days prior to the commencement of commercial operations at the new business facility. The initial application for claiming tax credits must be made in the taxpayer's tax period immediately following the tax period in which commencement of commercial operations began at the new business facility. This provision shall have effect on all initial applications filed on or after August 28, 1992. No credit shall be allowed pursuant to this section unless the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the new business facility for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed equals or exceeds two; except that the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment by a revenue-producing enterprise other than a revenue-producing enterprise defined in paragraphs (a) to (g) and (i) to (l) of subdivision (12) of section 135.100 which establishes an office as defined in subdivision (9) of section 135.100 shall equal or exceed twenty-five.\n\n2. For tax periods beginning after August 28, 1991, in the case of a taxpayer operating an existing business facility, the credit allowed by subsection 1 of this section shall offset the greater of:\n\n(1) Some portion of the income tax otherwise imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or in the case of an insurance company, the tax on the direct premiums, as defined in chapter 148, and in the case of an insurance company exempt from the thirty percent employee requirement of section 135.230, against any obligation imposed pursuant to section 375.916 with respect to such taxpayer's new business facility income for the taxable year for which such credit is allowed; or\n\n(2) Up to fifty percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, seventy-five percent of the business income tax otherwise imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or in the case of an insurance company, the tax on the direct premiums, as defined in chapter 148, and in the case of an insurance company exempt from the thirty percent employee requirement of section 135.230, against any obligation imposed pursuant to section 375.916 if the business operates no other facilities in Missouri. In the case of an existing business facility operating more than one facility in Missouri, the credit allowed in subsection 1 of this section shall offset up to the greater of the portion prescribed in subdivision (1) of this subsection or twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the business' tax, except that no taxpayer operating more than one facility in Missouri shall be allowed to offset more than twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the taxpayer's business income tax in any tax period under the method prescribed in this subdivision. Such credit shall be an amount equal to the sum of one hundred dollars or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, one hundred fifty dollars for each new business facility employee plus one hundred dollars or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, one hundred fifty dollars for each one hundred thousand dollars, or major fraction thereof (which shall be deemed to be fifty-one percent or more) in new business facility investment. For the purpose of this section, tax credits earned by a taxpayer, who establishes a new business facility because it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of subdivision (5) of section 135.100, shall offset the greater of the portion prescribed in subdivision (1) of this subsection or up to fifty percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, seventy-five percent of the business' tax provided the business operates no other facilities in Missouri. In the case of a business operating more than one facility in Missouri, the credit allowed in subsection 1 of this section shall offset up to the greater of the portion prescribed in subdivision (1) of this subsection or twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the business' tax, except that no taxpayer operating more than one facility in Missouri shall be allowed to offset more than twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the taxpayer's business income tax in any tax period under the method prescribed in this subdivision.\n\n3. For tax periods beginning after August 28, 1991, in the case of a taxpayer not operating an existing business facility, the credit allowed by subsection 1 of this section shall offset the greater of:\n\n(1) Some portion of the income tax otherwise imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or in the case of an insurance company, the tax on the direct premiums, as defined in chapter 148, and in the case of an insurance company exempt from the thirty percent employee requirement of section 135.230, against any obligation imposed pursuant to section 375.916 with respect to such taxpayer's new business facility income for the taxable year for which such credit is allowed; or\n\n(2) Up to one hundred percent of the business income tax otherwise imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265, or in the case of an insurance company, the tax on the direct premiums, as defined in chapter 148, and in the case of an insurance company exempt from the thirty percent employee requirement of section 135.230, against any obligation imposed pursuant to section 375.916 if the business has no other facilities operating in Missouri. In the case of a taxpayer not operating an existing business and operating more than one facility in Missouri, the credit allowed by subsection 1 of this section shall offset up to the greater of the portion prescribed in subdivision (1) of this subsection or twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the business' tax, except that no taxpayer operating more than one facility in Missouri shall be allowed to offset more than twenty-five percent or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, thirty-five percent of the taxpayer's business income tax in any tax period under the method prescribed in this subdivision. Such credit shall be an amount equal to the sum of seventy-five dollars or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, one hundred twenty-five dollars for each new business facility employee plus seventy-five dollars or, in the case of an economic development project located within a distressed community as defined in section 135.530, one hundred twenty-five dollars for each one hundred thousand dollars, or major fraction thereof (which shall be deemed to be fifty-one percent or more) in new business facility investment.\n\n4. The number of new business facility employees during any taxable year shall be determined by dividing by twelve the sum of the number of individuals employed on the last business day of each month of such taxable year. If the new business facility is in operation for less than the entire taxable year, the number of new business facility employees shall be determined by dividing the sum of the number of individuals employed on the last business day of each full calendar month during the portion of such taxable year during which the new business facility was in operation by the number of full calendar months during such period. For the purpose of computing the credit allowed by this section in the case of a facility which qualifies as a new business facility because it qualifies as a separate facility pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, and, in the case of a new business facility which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of subdivision (5) of section 135.100, or subdivision (11) of section 135.100, the number of new business facility employees at such facility shall be reduced by the average number of individuals employed, computed as provided in this subsection, at the facility during the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which such expansion, acquisition, or replacement occurred and shall further be reduced by the number of individuals employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer that was subsequently transferred to the new business facility from another Missouri facility and for which credits authorized in this section are not being earned, whether such credits are earned because of an expansion, acquisition, relocation or the establishment of a new facility.\n\n5. For the purpose of computing the credit allowed by this section in the case of a facility which qualifies as a new business facility because it qualifies as a separate facility pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, and, in the case of a new business facility which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of subdivision (5) of section 135.100 or subdivision (11) of section 135.100, the amount of the taxpayer's new business facility investment in such facility shall be reduced by the average amount, computed as provided in subdivision (8) of section 135.100 for new business facility investment, of the investment of the taxpayer, or related taxpayer immediately preceding such expansion or replacement or at the time of acquisition. Furthermore, the amount of the taxpayer's new business facility investment shall also be reduced by the amount of investment employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer which was subsequently transferred to the new business facility from another Missouri facility and for which credits authorized in this section are not being earned, whether such credits are earned because of an expansion, acquisition, relocation or the establishment of a new facility.\n\n6. If a facility, which does not constitute a new business facility, is expanded by the taxpayer, the expansion shall be considered a separate facility eligible for the credit allowed by this section if:\n\n(1) The taxpayer's new business facility investment in the expansion during the tax period in which the credits allowed in this section are claimed exceeds one hundred thousand dollars, or, if less, one hundred percent of the investment in the original facility prior to expansion and if the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the expansion facility for the taxable year for which credit is claimed equals or exceeds two, except that the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the expansion facility for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed equals or exceeds twenty-five if an office as defined in subdivision (9) of section 135.100 is established by a revenue-producing enterprise other than a revenue-producing enterprise defined in paragraphs (a) to (g) and (i) to (l) of subdivision (12) of section 135.100 and the total number of employees at the facility after the expansion is at least two greater than the total number of employees before the expansion, except that the total number of employees at the facility after the expansion is at least greater than the number of employees before the expansion by twenty-five, if an office as defined in subdivision (9) of section 135.100 is established by a revenue-producing enterprise other than a revenue-producing enterprise defined in paragraphs (a) to (g) and (i) to (l) of subdivision (12) of section 135.100; and\n\n(2) The expansion otherwise constitutes a new business facility. The taxpayer's investment in the expansion and in the original facility prior to expansion shall be determined in the manner provided in subdivision (8) of section 135.100.\n\n7. No credit shall be allowed pursuant to this section to a public utility, as such term is defined in section 386.020. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, motor carriers, barge lines or railroads engaged in transporting property for hire, or any interexchange telecommunications company or local exchange telecommunications company that establishes a new business facility shall be eligible to qualify for credits allowed in this section.\n\n8. For the purposes of the credit described in this section, in the case of a corporation described in section 143.471 or partnership, in computing Missouri's tax liability, this credit shall be allowed to the following:\n\n(1) The shareholders of the corporation described in section 143.471;\n\n(2) The partners of the partnership.\n\n­­This credit shall be apportioned to the entities described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the taxpayer's tax period.\n\n9.

For the purpose of the refund as authorized in this subsection,\"specified facility items\"means equipment, computers, computer software, copiers, tenant finishing, furniture and fixtures installed and in use at the new business facility during the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall perfect such refund by attesting in writing to the director, subject to the penalties of perjury, the requirements prescribed in this subsection have been met and submitting any other information the director may require.\n\n14. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any taxpayer may sell, assign, exchange, convey or otherwise transfer tax credits allowed in subsection 9 of this section under the terms and conditions prescribed in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection.

Each designated enterprise zone or satellite zone must report to the director on an annual basis regarding the status of the zone and business activity within the zone. On the fifth anniversary of the designation of each zone after August 8, 1989, and each five years thereafter, the director shall evaluate the activity which has occurred within the zone during the previous five-year period, including business investments and the creation of new jobs. If the director finds that the plan outlined in the application for designation was not implemented in good faith, or if such zone no longer qualifies under the original criteria, or if the director finds that the zone is not being effectively promoted or developed, the director may recommend that the designation of that area as an enterprise zone be cancelled. All agreements negotiated under the benefits of such zone shall remain in effect for the originally agreed upon duration.

At the hearing, interested parties, including the director, may present witnesses and evidence as to why the enterprise zone designation for that particular area should be continued or cancelled. Within thirty days after the hearing, the director shall determine whether or not the designation should be continued. If it is not continued, the director shall remove the designation from the area and, following the procedures outlined in this section, award the designation of an enterprise zone to another applicant.

The exemption or credit established and allowed by section 135.220 and the credits allowed and established by subdivisions (1), (2), (3) and (4) of subsection 1 of section 135.225 shall be granted with respect to any new business facility located within an enterprise zone for a vested period not to exceed ten years following the date upon which the new business facility commences operation within the enterprise zone and such exemption shall be calculated, for each succeeding year of eligibility, in accordance with the formulas applied in the initial year in which the new business facility is certified as such, subject, however, to the limitation that all such credits allowed in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 shall be removed not later than fifteen years after the enterprise zone is designated as such. No credits shall be allowed pursuant to subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of subsection 1 of section 135.225 or section 135.235 and no exemption shall be allowed pursuant to section 135.220 unless the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the new business facility for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed equals or exceeds two or the new business facility is a revenue-producing enterprise as defined in paragraph (d) of subdivision (6) of section 135.200. In order to qualify for either the exemption pursuant to section 135.220 or the credit pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 135.225, or both, it shall be required that at least thirty percent of new business facility employees, as determined by subsection 4 of section 135.110, meet the criteria established in section 135.240 or are residents of an enterprise zone or some combination thereof, except taxpayers who establish a new business facility by operating a revenue-producing enterprise as defined in paragraph (d) of subdivision (6) of section 135.200 or any taxpayer that is an insurance company that established a new business facility satisfying the requirements of subdivision (8) of section 135.100 located within an enterprise zone after June 30, 1993, and before December 31, 1994, and that employs in excess of three hundred fifty new business facility employees at such facility each tax period for which the credits allowable pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (4) of subsection 1 of section 135.225 are claimed shall not be required to meet such requirement. A new business facility described as SIC 3751 shall be required to employ fifteen percent of such employees instead of the required thirty percent. For the purpose of satisfying the thirty-percent requirement, residents must have lived in the enterprise zone for a period of at least one full calendar month and must have been employed at the new business facility for at least one full calendar month, and persons qualifying because they meet the requirements of section 135.240 must have satisfied such requirement at the time they were employed by the new business facility and must have been employed at the new business facility for at least one full calendar month. The director may temporarily reduce or waive this requirement for any business in an enterprise zone with ten or less full-time employees, and for businesses with eleven to twenty full-time employees this requirement may be temporarily reduced. No reduction or waiver may be granted for more than one tax period and shall not be renewable.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, motor carriers, barge lines or railroads engaged in transporting property for hire or any interexchange telecommunications company that establish a new business facility shall be eligible to qualify for the exemptions allowed in sections 135.215 and 135.220, and the credits allowed in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the refund established and authorized in section 135.245, except that trucks, truck-trailers, truck semitrailers, rail or barge vehicles or other rolling stock for hire, track, switches, bridges, barges, tunnels, rail yards and spurs shall not constitute new business facility investment nor shall truck drivers or rail or barge vehicle operators constitute new business facility employees.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 135.200 to 135.256 to the contrary, motor carriers establishing a new business facility on or after January 1, 1993, but before January 1, 1995, may qualify for the tax credits available pursuant to sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption provided in section 135.220, even if such new business facility has not satisfied the employee criteria, provided that such taxpayer employs an average of at least two hundred persons at such facility, exclusive of truck drivers and provided that such taxpayer maintains an average investment of at least ten million dollars at such facility, exclusive of rolling stock, during the tax period for which such credits and exemption are being claimed.\n\n4. Any governing authority having jurisdiction of an area that has been designated an enterprise zone may petition the department to expand the boundaries of such existing enterprise zone. The director may approve such expansion if the director finds that:\n\n(1) The area to be expanded meets the requirements prescribed in section 135.207 or 135.210, whichever is applicable;\n\n(2) The area to be expanded is contiguous to the existing enterprise zone; and\n\n(3) The number of expansions do not exceed three after August 28, 1994.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the fifteen-year limitation as prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, any governing authority having jurisdiction of an area that has been designated as an enterprise zone by the director, except one designated pursuant to this subsection, may file a petition, as prescribed by the director, for redesignation of such area for an additional period not to exceed seven years following the fifteenth anniversary of the enterprise zone's initial designation date; provided:\n\n(1) The petition is filed with the director within three years prior to the date the tax credits authorized in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 are required to be removed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section;\n\n(2) The governing authority identifies and conforms the boundaries of the area to be designated a new enterprise zone to the political boundaries established by the latest decennial census, unless otherwise approved by the director;\n\n(3) The area satisfies the requirements prescribed in subdivisions (3) and (4) of section 135.205 according to the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey, based on the most recent of five-year period estimate data in which the final year of the estimate ends in either zero or five or other appropriate source as approved by the director;\n\n(4) The governing authority satisfies the requirements prescribed in sections 135.210, 135.215 and 135.255;\n\n(5) The director finds that the area is unlikely to support reasonable tax assessment or to experience reasonable economic growth without such designation; and\n\n(6) The director's recommendation that the area be designated as an enterprise zone is approved by the joint committee on economic development policy and planning, as otherwise required in subsection 3*of section 135.210.\n\n6. Any taxpayer having established a new business facility in an enterprise zone except one designated pursuant to subsection 5 of this section, who did not earn the tax credits authorized in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 for the full ten-year period because of the fifteen-year limitation as prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, shall be granted such benefits for ten tax years, less the number of tax years the benefits were claimed or could have been claimed prior to the expiration of the original fifteen-year period, except that such tax benefits shall not be earned for more than seven tax periods during the ensuing seven-year period, provided the taxpayer continues to operate the new business facility in an area that is designated an enterprise zone pursuant to subsection 5 of this section. Any taxpayer who establishes a new business facility subsequent to the commencement of the ensuing seven-year period, as authorized in subsection 5 of this section, may qualify for the tax credits authorized in sections 135.225 and 135.235, and the exemptions authorized in sections 135.215 and 135.220, pursuant to the same terms and conditions as prescribed in sections 135.100 to 135.256.

The director of the department of economic development may, subject to the requirements of section 536.021, issue such rules and regulations as he deems necessary regarding the qualifications necessary for an area to be deemed an \"enterprise zone\" and for the continuation of such designation. Beginning January 1, 1987, the director shall prescribe the method for submitting applications for claiming the tax credits allowed in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 and shall, if such application is approved, certify same to the director of revenue that the taxpayer claiming the credits allowed in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 has satisfied all requirements prescribed in sections 135.200 to 135.255, and is therefore eligible to claim the credits and exemption. The director shall also calculate and specify the amount of the credits earned by the taxpayer during the taxpayer's first taxable year in which such credits are claimed and for each of the nine succeeding taxable years the credits are claimed by the taxpayer and shall certify such amounts to the director of revenue. The director shall certify the extent to which such earned credits and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 can be claimed to the director of revenue and shall notify the taxpayer in writing of such determination. The director may prescribe such rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 135.200 to 135.255.\n\n2. The director of revenue shall determine the amount of the taxpayer's refund, as allowed in section 135.245, if any, and shall notify the taxpayer in writing of any amount to be refunded. The director of revenue may, subject to the requirements of section 536.021, prescribe rules and regulations necessary to process the credits allowed in sections 135.225 and 135.235 and the exemption allowed in section 135.220 and the refund allowed in section 135.245 following certification of eligibility by the director. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of this section shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of section 536.024.\n\n3.

The protest shall be in writing and shall set forth the grounds on which the protest is based.\n\n4. If a protest is filed, the director of economic development shall consider the taxpayer's grounds for protest and make a determination concerning such protest. The director of economic development shall notify the taxpayer in writing of such determination within thirty days following the date in which the written protest was received. Such notice shall be mailed to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail and such notice shall set forth briefly the director of economic development's findings of fact and the basis of decision.\n\n5.

The certified capital company shall state the amount of capital it or a qualified investing entity intends to invest and the name of the business in which it or a qualified investing entity intends to invest. The certified capital company shall also provide to the department an explanation of its determination that the business meets the definition of a qualified Missouri business. If the department determines that the business does not meet the definition of a qualified Missouri business, it shall, within the fifteen-working-day period prior to the making of the proposed investment, notify the certified capital company of its determination and an explanation thereof. If the department fails to notify the certified capital company with respect to the proposed investment within the fifteen-working-day period prior to the making of the proposed investment, the company in which the certified capital company or a qualified investing entity proposes to invest shall be deemed to be a qualified Missouri business. If a certified capital company fails to notify the department prior to making an initial investment in a business, the department may subsequently determine that the business in which the certified capital company or a qualified investing entity invested was not a qualified Missouri business even though the business, at the time of the investment, met the requirements of subdivision (15) of subsection 2 of section 135.500;\n\n(5) All certified capital which is not required to be placed in qualified investments or which has been placed in qualified investments and can be received by the company, may be held or invested in such manner as the Missouri certified capital company, in its discretion, deems appropriate. The proceeds of all certified capital which is received by a certified capital company after it was originally placed in qualified investments may be placed again in qualified investments and shall count toward any requirement in sections 135.500 to 135.529 with respect to placing certified capital in qualified investments.\n\n2. A certified capital company may make qualified distributions at any time. In order to make distributions, other than qualified distributions, a certified capital company must have made cumulative qualified investments, including those made through a qualified investing entity, in an amount cumulatively equal to at least one hundred percent of its certified capital. Cumulative distributions to equity holders, other than qualified distributions, in excess of the certified capital company's original certified capital and any additional capital contributions to the certified capital company shall be subject to audit by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm acceptable to the department, at the expense of the certified capital company. The audit shall determine whether aggregate cumulative distributions to all investors and equity holders, other than qualified distributions, when combined with all tax credits utilized by investors pursuant to sections 135.500 to 135.529, have resulted in an annual internal rate of return of fifteen percent computed on the sum of total original certified capital of the certified capital company and any additional capital contributions to the certified capital company. Twenty-five percent of distributions made, other than qualified distributions, in excess of the amount required to produce a fifteen percent annual internal rate of return, as determined by the audit, shall be payable by the certified capital company to the Missouri development finance board. Distributions or payments to debt holders of a certified capital company, however, may be made without restriction with respect to debt owed to them by a certified capital company. A debt holder that is also an investor or equity holder of a certified capital company may receive distributions or payments with respect to such debt without restriction.\n\n3. No qualified investment may be made at a cost to a Missouri certified capital company greater than fifteen percent of the total certified capital under management of the Missouri certified capital company at the time of investment.\n\n4. Documents and other materials submitted by Missouri certified capital companies or by businesses for purposes of the continuance of certification may be deemed \"closed records\" pursuant to the provisions of section 620.014.\n\n5. Each Missouri certified capital company shall report the following to the department:\n\n(1) As soon as practicable after the receipt of certified capital, the name of each investor from which the certified capital was received, the amount of each investor's investment of certified capital and tax credits computed without regard to any limitations under subsection 3 of section 135.503, and the date on which the certified capital was received;\n\n(2) On a quarterly basis, the amount of the Missouri certified capital company's certified capital at the end of the quarter, whether or not the Missouri certified capital company has invested, together with any investments made by a qualified investing entity that are deemed to have been made by the certified capital company, more than fifteen percent of the total certified capital under management in any one company, and all qualified investments that the Missouri certified capital company has made or has been deemed to have been made through a qualified investing entity;\n\n(3) Each Missouri certified capital company shall provide annual audited financial statements to the department which include an opinion of an independent certified public accountant to the department within ninety days of the close of the fiscal year. At the same time, the certified capital company shall also provide audited financial statements for any qualified investing entity that has made qualified investments on its behalf, unless the financial results of such qualified investing entity are included in the consolidated financial statements of the certified capital company. The audit shall address the methods of operation and conduct of the business of the Missouri certified capital company to determine if the Missouri certified capital company is complying with the statutes and program rules and that the funds received by the Missouri certified capital company have been invested as required within the time limits provided by sections 135.500 to 135.529.\n\n(L. 1996 H.B. 1237, A.L. 1997 2d Ex.

The amount of the tax credit claimed shall not exceed the amount of the taxpayer's state tax liability for the tax year for which the credit is claimed. No tax credit claimed under this section shall be refundable. The tax credit shall be claimed in the tax year in which the qualifying sale of the qualifying beef occurred, but any amount of credit that the taxpayer is prohibited by this section from claiming in a tax year may be carried forward to any of the taxpayer's four subsequent tax years. The total amount of tax credits that any taxpayer may claim shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars per year.

All required information obtained by the authority shall be confidential and not disclosed except by court order, subpoena, or as otherwise provided by law. If the taxpayer and the qualified sale meet all criteria required by this section and approval is granted by the authority, the authority shall issue a tax credit certificate in the appropriate amount. Tax credit certificates issued under this section may be assigned, transferred, sold, or otherwise conveyed, and the new owner of the tax credit certificate shall have the same rights in the tax credit as the original taxpayer.

The authority shall, at least annually, submit a report to the Missouri general assembly reviewing the costs and benefits of the program established under this section.\n\n8. The authority may promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028.

As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Adjusted purchase price\", the product of:\n\n(a) The amount paid to the issuer of a qualified equity investment for such qualified equity investment; and\n\n(b) The following fraction:\n\na. The numerator shall be the dollar amount of qualified low-income community investments held by the issuer in this state as of the credit allowance date during the applicable tax year; and\n\nb. The denominator shall be the total dollar amount of qualified low-income community investments held by the issuer in all states as of the credit allowance date during the applicable tax year;\n\nc. For purposes of calculating the amount of qualified low-income community investments held by an issuer, an investment shall be considered held by an issuer even if the investment has been sold or repaid; provided that the issuer reinvests an amount equal to the capital returned to or recovered by the issuer from the original investment, exclusive of any profits realized, in another qualified low-income community investment within twelve months of the receipt of such capital. An issuer shall not be required to reinvest capital returned from qualified low-income community investments after the sixth anniversary of the issuance of the qualified equity investment, the proceeds of which were used to make the qualified low-income community investment, and the qualified low-income community investment shall be considered held by the issuer through the seventh anniversary of the qualified equity investment's issuance;\n\n(2)\"Applicable percentage\", zero percent for each of the first two credit allowance dates, seven percent for the third credit allowance date, and eight percent for the next four credit allowance dates;\n\n(3)\"Credit allowance date\", with respect to any qualified equity investment:\n\n(a) The date on which such investment is initially made; and\n\n(b) Each of the six anniversary dates of such date thereafter;\n\n(4)\"Long-term debt security\", any debt instrument issued by a qualified community development entity, at par value or a premium, with an original maturity date of at least seven years from the date of its issuance, with no acceleration of repayment, amortization, or prepayment features prior to its original maturity date, and with no distribution, payment, or interest features related to the profitability of the qualified community development entity or the performance of the qualified community development entity's investment portfolio. The foregoing shall in no way limit the holder's ability to accelerate payments on the debt instrument in situations where the issuer has defaulted on covenants designed to ensure compliance with this section or Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n\n(5)\"Qualified active low-income community business\", the meaning given such term in Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; provided that any business that derives or projects to derive fifteen percent or more of its annual revenue from the rental or sale of real estate shall not be considered to be a qualified active low-income community business;\n\n(6)\"Qualified community development entity\", the meaning given such term in Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; provided that such entity has entered into an allocation agreement with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the U.S. Treasury Department with respect to credits authorized by Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which includes the state of Missouri within the service area set forth in such allocation agreement;\n\n(7)\"Qualified equity investment\", any equity investment in, or long-term debt security issued by, a qualified community development entity that:\n\n(a) Is acquired after September 4, 2007, at its original issuance solely in exchange for cash;\n\n(b) Has at least eighty-five percent of its cash purchase price used by the issuer to make qualified low-income community investments; and\n\n(c) Is designated by the issuer as a qualified equity investment under this subdivision and is certified by the department of economic development as not exceeding the limitation contained in subsection 2 of this section. This term shall include any qualified equity investment that does not meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivision if such investment was a qualified equity investment in the hands of a prior holder;\n\n(8)\"Qualified low-income community investment\", any capital or equity investment in, or loan to, any qualified active low-income community business. With respect to any one qualified active low-income community business, the maximum amount of qualified low-income community investments made in such business, on a collective basis with all of its affiliates, that may be used from the calculation of any numerator described in subparagraph a. of paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be ten million dollars whether issued to one or several qualified community development entities;\n\n(9)\"Tax credit\", a credit against the tax otherwise due under chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed in sections 143.191 to 143.265, or otherwise due under section 375.916 or chapter 147, 148, or 153;\n\n(10)\"Taxpayer\", any individual or entity subject to the tax imposed in chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed in sections 143.191 to 143.265, or the tax imposed in section 375.916 or chapter 147, 148, or 153.\n\n2. A taxpayer that makes a qualified equity investment earns a vested right to tax credits under this section. On each credit allowance date of such qualified equity investment the taxpayer, or subsequent holder of the qualified equity investment, shall be entitled to a tax credit during the taxable year including such credit allowance date. The tax credit amount shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the adjusted purchase price paid to the issuer of such qualified equity investment. The amount of the tax credit claimed shall not exceed the amount of the taxpayer's state tax liability for the tax year for which the tax credit is claimed. No tax credit claimed under this section shall be refundable or transferable. Tax credits earned by a partnership, limited liability company, S-corporation, or other pass-through entity may be allocated to the partners, members, or shareholders of such entity for their direct use in accordance with the provisions of any agreement among such partners, members, or shareholders. Any amount of tax credit that the taxpayer is prohibited by this section from claiming in a taxable year may be carried forward to any of the taxpayer's five subsequent taxable years. The department of economic development shall limit the monetary amount of qualified equity investments permitted under this section to a level necessary to limit tax credit utilization at no more than twenty-five million dollars of tax credits in any fiscal year. Such limitation on qualified equity investments shall be based on the anticipated utilization of credits without regard to the potential for taxpayers to carry forward tax credits to later tax years.\n\n3. The issuer of the qualified equity investment shall certify to the department of economic development the anticipated dollar amount of such investments to be made in this state during the first twelve-month period following the initial credit allowance date. If on the second credit allowance date, the actual dollar amount of such investments is different than the amount estimated, the department of economic development shall adjust the credits arising on the second allowance date to account for such difference.\n\n4. The department of economic development shall recapture the tax credit allowed under this section with respect to such qualified equity investment under this section if:\n\n(1) Any amount of the federal tax credit available with respect to a qualified equity investment that is eligible for a tax credit under this section is recaptured under Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; or\n\n(2) The issuer redeems or makes principal repayment with respect to a qualified equity investment prior to the seventh anniversary of the issuance of such qualified equity investment. Any tax credit that is subject to recapture shall be recaptured from the taxpayer that claimed the tax credit on a return.\n\n5. The department of economic development shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section, including recapture provisions on a scaled proportional basis, and to administer the allocation of tax credits issued for qualified equity investments, which shall be conducted on a first-come, first-serve basis. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after September 4, 2007, shall be invalid and void.\n\n6. For fiscal years following fiscal year 2010, qualified equity investments shall not be made under this section unless reauthorization is made pursuant to this subsection. For all fiscal years following fiscal year 2010, unless the general assembly adopts a concurrent resolution granting authority to the department of economic development to approve qualified equity investments for the Missouri new markets development program and clearly describing the amount of tax credits available for the next fiscal year, or otherwise complies with the provisions of this subsection, no qualified equity investments may be permitted to be made under this section. The amount of available tax credits contained in such a resolution shall not exceed the limitation provided under subsection 2 of this section. In any year in which the provisions of this section shall sunset pursuant to subsection 7 of this section, reauthorization shall be made by general law and not by concurrent resolution. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a taxpayer who makes a qualified equity investment prior to the expiration of authority to make qualified equity investments from claiming tax credits relating to such qualified equity investment for each applicable credit allowance date.\n\n7. Under section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset act:\n\n(1) The provisions of the new program authorized under this section shall automatically sunset six years after September 4, 2007, unless reauthorized by an act of the general assembly; and\n\n(2) If such program is reauthorized, the program authorized under this section shall automatically sunset twelve years after the effective date of the reauthorization of this section; and\n\n(3) This section shall terminate on September first of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the program authorized under this section is sunset. However, nothing in this subsection shall preclude a taxpayer who makes a qualified equity investment prior to sunset of this section under the provisions of section 23.253 from claiming tax credits relating to such qualified equity investment for each credit allowance date.\n\n(L. 2007 1st Ex.

Tax credit allowed, duration — prohibition on receiving other tax credits — limitations on issuance of tax credits — cap — eligibility of certain expansions — employee calculations — computation of credit — flow-through tax treatments — credits may be claimed, when — certificates — refunds — verification procedures. —1. A taxpayer who establishes a new business facility may, upon approval by the department, be allowed a credit, each tax year for up to ten tax years, in an amount determined as set forth in this section, against the tax imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265. No taxpayer shall receive multiple ten-year periods for subsequent expansions at the same facility.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any taxpayer who establishes a new business facility in an enhanced enterprise zone and is awarded state tax credits under this section may not also receive tax credits under sections 135.100 to 135.150, sections 135.200 to 135.286, or section 135.535, and may not simultaneously receive tax credits under sections 620.1875 to 620.1890 at the same facility.\n\n3. No credit shall be issued pursuant to this section unless:\n\n(1) The number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the new business facility for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed equals or exceeds two; and\n\n(2) The new business facility investment for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n4. The annual amount of credits allowed for an approved enhanced business enterprise shall be the lesser of:\n\n(1) The annual amount authorized by the department for the enhanced business enterprise, which shall be limited to the projected state economic benefit, as determined by the department; or\n\n(2) The sum calculated based upon the following:\n\n(a) A credit of four hundred dollars for each new business facility employee employed within an enhanced enterprise zone;\n\n(b) An additional credit of four hundred dollars for each new business facility employee who is a resident of an enhanced enterprise zone;\n\n(c) An additional credit of four hundred dollars for each new business facility employee who is paid by the enhanced business enterprise a wage that exceeds the average wage paid within the county in which the facility is located, as determined by the department; and\n\n(d) A credit equal to two percent of new business facility investment within an enhanced enterprise zone.\n\n5. Prior to January 1, 2007, in no event shall the department authorize more than four million dollars annually to be issued for all enhanced business enterprises. After December 31, 2006, in no event shall the department authorize more than twenty-four million dollars annually to be issued for all enhanced business enterprises.\n\n6. If a facility, which does not constitute a new business facility, is expanded by the taxpayer, the expansion shall be considered eligible for the credit allowed by this section if:\n\n(1) The taxpayer's new business facility investment in the expansion during the tax period in which the credits allowed in this section are claimed exceeds one hundred thousand dollars and if the number of new business facility employees engaged or maintained in employment at the expansion facility for the taxable year for which credit is claimed equals or exceeds two, and the total number of employees at the facility after the expansion is at least two greater than the total number of employees before the expansion; and\n\n(2) The taxpayer's investment in the expansion and in the original facility prior to expansion shall be determined in the manner provided in subdivision (19) of section 135.950.\n\n7. The number of new business facility employees during any taxable year shall be determined by dividing by twelve the sum of the number of individuals employed on the last business day of each month of such taxable year. If the new business facility is in operation for less than the entire taxable year, the number of new business facility employees shall be determined by dividing the sum of the number of individuals employed on the last business day of each full calendar month during the portion of such taxable year during which the new business facility was in operation by the number of full calendar months during such period. For the purpose of computing the credit allowed by this section in the case of a facility which qualifies as a new business facility under subsection 6 of this section, and in the case of a new business facility which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of subdivision (17) of section 135.950, or subdivision (25) of section 135.950, the number of new business facility employees at such facility shall be reduced by the average number of individuals employed, computed as provided in this subsection, at the facility during the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which such expansion, acquisition, or replacement occurred and shall further be reduced by the number of individuals employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer that was subsequently transferred to the new business facility from another Missouri facility and for which credits authorized in this section are not being earned, whether such credits are earned because of an expansion, acquisition, relocation, or the establishment of a new facility.\n\n8. In the case where a new business facility employee who is a resident of an enhanced enterprise zone for less than a twelve-month period is employed for less than a twelve-month period, the credits allowed by paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section shall be determined by multiplying four hundred dollars by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the taxpayer's tax year for which such credits are claimed, in which the employee was a resident of an enhanced enterprise zone, and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five.\n\n9. For the purpose of computing the credit allowed by this section in the case of a facility which qualifies as a new business facility pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, and in the case of a new business facility which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of subdivision (17) of section 135.950 or subdivision (25) of section 135.950, the amount of the taxpayer's new business facility investment in such facility shall be reduced by the average amount, computed as provided in subdivision (19) of section 135.950 for new business facility investment, of the investment of the taxpayer, or related taxpayer immediately preceding such expansion or replacement or at the time of acquisition. Furthermore, the amount of the taxpayer's new business facility investment shall also be reduced by the amount of investment employed by the taxpayer or related taxpayer which was subsequently transferred to the new business facility from another Missouri facility and for which credits authorized in this section are not being earned, whether such credits are earned because of an expansion, acquisition, relocation, or the establishment of a new facility.\n\n10. For a taxpayer with flow-through tax treatment to its members, partners, or shareholders, the credit shall be allowed to members, partners, or shareholders in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the taxpayer's tax period.\n\n11. Credits may not be carried forward but shall be claimed for the taxable year during which commencement of commercial operations occurs at such new business facility, and for each of the nine succeeding taxable years for which the credit is issued.\n\n12. Certificates of tax credit authorized by this section may be transferred, sold, or assigned by filing a notarized endorsement thereof with the department that names the transferee, the amount of tax credit transferred, and the value received for the credit, as well as any other information reasonably requested by the department. The sale price cannot be less than seventy-five percent of the par value of such credits.\n\n13. The director of revenue shall issue a refund to the taxpayer to the extent that the amount of credits allowed in this section exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's income tax.\n\n14. Prior to the issuance of tax credits, the department shall verify through the department of revenue, or any other state department, that the tax credit applicant does not owe any delinquent income, sales, or use tax or interest or penalties on such taxes, or any delinquent fees or assessments levied by any state department and through the department of commerce and insurance that the applicant does not owe any delinquent insurance taxes. Such delinquency shall not affect the authorization of the application for such tax credits, except that the amount of credits issued shall be reduced by the applicant's tax delinquency. If the department of revenue or the department of commerce and insurance, or any other state department, concludes that a taxpayer is delinquent after June fifteenth but before July first of any year and the application of tax credits to such delinquency causes a tax deficiency on behalf of the taxpayer to arise, then the taxpayer shall be granted thirty days to satisfy the deficiency in which interest, penalties, and additions to tax shall be tolled. After applying all available credits toward a tax delinquency, the administering agency shall notify the appropriate department, and that department shall update the amount of outstanding delinquent tax owed by the applicant. If any credits remain after satisfying all insurance, income, sales, and use tax delinquencies, the remaining credits shall be issued to the applicant, subject to the restrictions of other provisions of law.\n\n(L. 2004 S.B. 1155 § 135.1070, A.L. 2007 1st Ex.

Megaprojects, tax credit authorized, eligibility — department duties — binding contract required, when — issuance of credits, procedure. —1. A taxpayer who establishes a megaproject, approved by the department, within an enhanced enterprise zone shall, in exchange for the consideration provided by new tax revenues and other economic stimuli that will be generated from the new jobs created by the megaproject, be allowed an income tax credit equal to the percentage of actual new annual payroll of the taxpayer attributable to employees directly related to the manufacturing and assembly process and administration, as provided under subsection 4 of this section. A taxpayer seeking approval of a megaproject shall submit an application to the department. The department shall not approve any megaproject after December 31, 2008. The department shall not approve any credits for megaprojects to be issued prior to January 1, 2013, and in no event shall the department authorize more than forty million dollars to be issued annually for all megaprojects. The total amount of credits issued under this section shall not exceed two hundred forty million dollars.\n\n2. In considering applications for approval of megaprojects, the department may approve an application if:\n\n(1) The taxpayer's project is financially sound and the taxpayer has adequately demonstrated an ability to successfully undertake and complete the megaproject. This determination shall be supported by a professional third-party market feasibility analysis conducted on behalf of the state by a firm with direct experience with the industry of the proposed megaproject, and by a professional third-party financial analysis of the taxpayer's ability to complete the project;\n\n(2) The taxpayer's plan of repayment to the state of the amount of tax credits provided is reasonable and sound;\n\n(3) The taxpayer's megaproject will create new jobs that were not jobs previously performed by employees of the taxpayer or a related taxpayer in Missouri;\n\n(4) Local taxing entities are providing a significant level of incentives for the megaproject relative to the projected new local tax revenues created by the megaproject;\n\n(5) There is at least one other state or foreign country that the taxpayer verifies is being considered for the project, and receiving megaproject tax credits is a major factor in the taxpayer's decision to go forward with the project and not receiving the credit will result in the taxpayer not creating new jobs in Missouri;\n\n(6) The megaproject will be located in an enhanced enterprise zone which constitutes an economic or social liability and a detriment to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition and use;\n\n(7) The completion of the megaproject will serve an essential public municipal purpose by creating a substantial number of new jobs for citizens, increasing their purchasing power, improving their living conditions, and relieving the demand for unemployment and welfare assistance thereby promoting the economic development of the enhanced enterprise zone, the municipality, and the state; and\n\n(8) The creation of new jobs will assist the state in providing the services needed to protect the health, safety, and social and economic well-being of the citizens of the state.\n\n3. Prior to final approval of an application, a binding contract shall be executed between the taxpayer and the department of economic development which shall include, but not be limited to:\n\n(1) A repayment plan providing for cash payment to the state general revenue fund which shall result in a positive internal rate of return to the state and fully comply with the provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The rate of return shall be commercially reasonable and, over the life of the project, exceed one hundred and fifty percent of the state's borrowing costs based on the AAA-rated twenty-year tax-exempt bond rate average over a twenty-year borrowing period. The rate shall be verified by a professional third-party financial analysis;\n\n(2) The taxpayer's obligation to construct a facility of at least one million square feet within five years from the date of approval;\n\n(3) A requirement that the issuance of tax credits authorized under this section shall cease and the taxpayer shall immediately submit payment, to the state general revenue fund, in an amount equal to all credits previously issued less any amounts previously repaid, increased by an additional amount that shall provide the state a reasonable rate of return, in the event the taxpayer:\n\n(a) Fails to construct a facility of at least one million square feet within five years of the date of approval;\n\n(b) Fails to make a scheduled payment as required by the repayment plan; or\n\n(c) Fails to compensate new jobs at rate equal to or in excess of the county average wage or fails to offer health insurance to all such new jobs and pay at least eighty percent of such premiums; and\n\n(4) A requirement that the department shall suspend issuance of tax credits authorized under this section if, at any point, the total amount of tax credits issued less the total amount of repayments received equals one hundred and fifty-five million dollars.\n\n4. Upon approval of an application by the department, tax credits shall be issued annually for a period not to exceed eight years from the commencement of commercial operations of the megaproject. The eight-year period for the issuance of megaproject tax credits may extend beyond the expiration of the enhanced enterprise zone. The maximum percentage of the annual payroll of the taxpayer for new jobs located at the megaproject which may be approved or issued by the department for tax credits shall not exceed:\n\n(1) Eighty percent for the first three years that tax credits will be issued for the megaproject;\n\n(2) Sixty percent for the next two subsequent years;\n\n(3) Fifty percent for the next two subsequent years; and\n\n(4) Thirty percent for the remaining year.­­In no event shall the department issue more than forty million dollars annually in megaproject tax credits to any taxpayer. In any given year, the amount of tax credits issued shall be the lesser of forty million dollars, the applicable annual payroll percentage, or the amount of tax credits remaining unissued under the two hundred forty million dollar limitation on megaproject tax credit issuance provided under subsection 1 of this section.\n\n­­In no event shall the department issue more than forty million dollars annually in megaproject tax credits to any taxpayer. In any given year, the amount of tax credits issued shall be the lesser of forty million dollars, the applicable annual payroll percentage, or the amount of tax credits remaining unissued under the two hundred forty million dollar limitation on megaproject tax credit issuance provided under subsection 1 of this section.\n\n5. Tax credits issued under this section may be claimed against the tax imposed by chapter 143, excluding withholding tax imposed by sections 143.191 to 143.265. For taxpayers with flow-through tax treatment of its members, partners, or shareholders, the credit shall be allowed to members, partners, or shareholders in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the taxpayer's tax period. The director of revenue shall issue a refund to a taxpayer to the extent the amount of credits allowed in this section exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's income tax liability in the year redemption is authorized. An owner of tax credits issued under this section shall not be required to have any Missouri income tax liability in order to redeem such tax credits and receive a refund. The director of revenue shall prepare a form to permit the owner of such tax credits to obtain a refund.\n\n6. Certificates of tax credits authorized under this section may be transferred, sold, or assigned by filing a notarized endorsement thereof with the department that names the transferee, the amount of tax credit transferred, and the value received for the credit, as well as any other information reasonably requested by the department. Upon such transfer, sale, or assignment, the transferee shall be the owner of such tax credits entitled to claim the tax credits or any refunds with respect thereto issued to the taxpayer. Tax credits may not be carried forward past the year of issuance. Tax credits authorized by this section may not be pledged or used to secure any bonds or other indebtedness issued by the state or any political subdivision of the state. Once such tax credits have been issued, nothing shall prohibit the owner of the tax credits from pledging the tax credits to any lender or other third party.\n\n7. Any taxpayer issued tax credits under this section shall provide an annual report to the department and the house and senate appropriations committees of the number of new jobs located at the megaproject, the new annual payroll of such new jobs, and such other information as may be required by the department to document the basis for benefits under this section. The department may withhold the approval of the annual issuance of any tax credits until it is satisfied that proper documentation has been provided, and shall reduce the tax credits to reflect any reduction in new payroll. If the department determines the average wage is below the county average wage, or the taxpayer has not maintained employee health insurance as required, the taxpayer shall not receive tax credits for that year.\n\n8. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any taxpayer who is awarded tax credits under this section shall not also receive tax credits under sections 135.100 to 135.150, sections 135.200 to 135.286, section 135.535, or sections 620.1875 to 620.1890.\n\n9. Any action brought in any court contesting the approval of a megaproject and the issuance of the tax credits, or any other action undertaken pursuant to this section related to such megaproject, shall be filed within ninety days following approval of the megaproject by the department.\n\n10. Records and documents relating to a proposed megaproject shall be deemed closed records until such time as the application has been approved. Provisions of this subsection to the contrary notwithstanding, records containing business plan information which may endanger the competitiveness of the business shall remain closed.\n\n11. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, no taxpayer who receives megaproject tax credits authorized under this section or any related taxpayer shall employ, prior to January 1, 2022, directly:\n\n(1) Any elected public official of this state holding office as of January 1, 2008;\n\n(2) Any director, deputy director, division director, or employee directly involved in negotiations between the department of economic development and a taxpayer relative to the megaproject who was employed as of January 1, 2008, by the department.\n\n(L. 2008 H.B. 2393)",
