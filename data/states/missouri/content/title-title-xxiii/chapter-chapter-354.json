Such changes shall be filed with the director prior to the actual modification.

Issuance of a certificate of authority may then be granted upon payment of the application fee prescribed in section 354.500 if the director is satisfied that the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The persons responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the applicant are competent, trustworthy, and possess good reputations;\n\n(2) The health care organization constitutes an appropriate mechanism whereby the health maintenance organization will effectively provide or arrange for the provision of basic health care services on a prepaid basis through insurance or otherwise, except to the extent of requirements for co-payments, coinsurance or deductibles;\n\n(3) The health maintenance organization is financially responsible and may reasonably be expected to meet its obligations to enrollees and prospective enrollees. In making this determination, the director may consider:\n\n(a) The financial soundness of the arrangements for health care services and the schedule of charges used in connection therewith;\n\n(b) The adequacy of working capital;\n\n(c) Any agreement with an insurer, a government, or any other organization for insuring the payment of the cost of health care services or the provision for automatic applicability of an alternative coverage in the event of discontinuance of the health maintenance organization;\n\n(d) Any agreement with providers for the provision of health care services; and\n\n(e) Any deposit of cash or securities submitted in accordance with subsection 2;\n\n(4) The health maintenance organization's arrangements for health care services and the schedule of charges used in connection therewith are financially sound;\n\n(5) The working capital be adequate;\n\n(6) Any agreement with an insurer, a health service corporation, a government, or any other organization for insuring the payment of the cost of health care services contain a provision for the automatic applicability of alternative coverage in the event of discontinuance of the health maintenance organization;\n\n(7) There be an agreement with providers for the provision of health care services;\n\n(8) The enrollees shall be afforded an opportunity to participate in matters of policy and operation pursuant to section 354.420;\n\n(9) Nothing in the proposed method of operation, as shown by the information submitted pursuant to section 354.405 or by independent investigation, is contrary to the public interest; and\n\n(10) The health maintenance organization is able to provide its enrollees with adequate access to health care providers.\n\n2. Unless otherwise provided below, each health maintenance organization shall deposit with the director, or with any organization or trustee acceptable to the director through which a custodial or controlled account is utilized, cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures that is acceptable to the director in the amount set forth in this subsection:\n\n(1) The amount for an organization that is beginning operation shall be the greater of: (a) five percent of its estimated expenditures for health care services for its first year of operation, (b) twice its estimated average monthly uncovered expenditures for its first year of operation, or (c) one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a medical group/staff model, or three hundred thousand dollars for an individual practice association. At the beginning of each succeeding year, unless not applicable, the organization shall deposit with the director, or organization or trustee, cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures acceptable to the director, in an amount equal to four percent of its estimated annual uncovered expenditures for that year.\n\n(2) Unless not applicable, an organization that is in operation on September 28, 1983, shall make a deposit equal to the larger of: (a) one percent of the preceding twelve months' uncovered expenditures, or (b) one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a medical group/staff model, or three hundred thousand dollars for an individual practice association on the first day of the first calendar year beginning six months or more after September 28, 1983. In the second calendar year, if applicable, the amount of the additional deposit shall be equal to two percent of its estimated annual uncovered expenditures. In the third calendar year, if applicable, the additional deposit shall be equal to three percent of its estimated annual uncovered expenditures for that year, and in the fourth calendar year and subsequent years, if applicable, the additional deposit shall be equal to four percent of its estimated annual uncovered expenditures for each year. Each year's estimate, after the first year of operation, shall reasonably reflect the prior years' operating experience and delivery arrangements. The director may waive any of the deposit requirements set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) above, whenever satisfied that the organization has sufficient net worth and an adequate history of generating net income to assure its financial viability for the next year, or its performance and obligations are guaranteed by an organization with sufficient net worth and an adequate history of generating net income, or the assets of the organization or its contracts with insurers, hospital or medical service corporations, governments, or other organizations are sufficient to reasonably assure the performance of its obligations.\n\n3. When an organization has achieved a net worth not including land, buildings, and equipment, of at least one million dollars or has achieved a net worth including organization-related land, buildings, and equipment of at least five million dollars, the annual deposit requirements shall not apply. The annual deposit requirement shall not apply to an organization if the total amount of the deposit is equal to twenty-five percent of its estimated annual uncovered expenditures for the next calendar year, or the capital and surplus requirements for the formation or admittance of an accident and health insurer in this state, whichever is less. If the organization has a guaranteeing organization which has been in operation for at least five years and has a net worth not including land, buildings, and equipment of at least one million dollars or which has been in operation for at least ten years and has a net worth including organization-related land, buildings, and equipment of at least five million dollars, the annual deposit requirement shall not apply; provided, however, that if the guaranteeing organization is sponsoring more than one organization, the net worth requirement shall be increased by a multiple equal to the number of such organizations. This requirement to maintain a deposit in excess of the deposit required of an accident and health insurer shall not apply during any time that the guaranteeing organization maintains a net worth at least equal to the capital and surplus requirements for an accident and health insurer for each organization it sponsors.\n\n4. All income from deposits shall belong to the depositing organization and shall be paid to it as it becomes available. A health maintenance organization that has made a securities deposit may withdraw the securities deposit or any part thereof, first having deposited, in lieu thereof, a deposit of cash, securities, or any combination of these or other measures of equal amount and value to that withdrawn. Any securities shall be approved by the director before being substituted.\n\n5. In any year in which an annual deposit is not required of an organization, at its request the director shall reduce the required deposit by one hundred thousand dollars for each two hundred fifty thousand dollars of net worth in excess of the amount that allows it not to make an annual deposit. If the amount of net worth no longer supports a reduction of its required deposit, the organization shall immediately redeposit one hundred thousand dollars for each two hundred fifty thousand dollars of reduction in net worth, provided that its total deposit shall not exceed the maximum required under this section. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 354.400 to 354.636, the deposit held by the director shall in no case be less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a group staff/model or three hundred thousand dollars for an individual practice association model.\n\n6.

The capital account shall be net of any accrued liabilities and be in the form of cash, securities or any combination of these or other measures acceptable to the director.\n\n7.

This agreement shall not prohibit the provider from collecting coinsurance, deductibles or co-payments, as specifically provided in the evidence of coverage, or fees for uncovered services delivered on a fee-for-service basis to enrollees. This agreement shall not prohibit a provider, except for a health care professional who is employed full time on the staff of a health carrier and has agreed to provide service exclusively to that health carrier's enrollees and no others, and an enrollee from agreeing to continue services solely at the expense of the enrollee, as long as the provider has clearly informed the enrollee that the health carrier may not cover or continue to cover a specific service or services. Except as provided herein, this agreement does not prohibit the provider from pursuing any available legal remedy; including, but not limited to, collecting from any insurance carrier providing coverage to a covered person.\"\n\n3. Every contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall set forth that in the event of a health carrier's or intermediary's insolvency or other cessation of operations, covered services to enrollees shall continue through the period for which a premium has been paid to the health carrier on behalf of the enrollee or until the enrollee's discharge from an inpatient facility, whichever time is greater.\n\n4.

In no event shall a participating provider collect or attempt to collect from an enrollee any money owed to the provider by the health carrier nor shall a participating provider collect or attempt to collect from an enrollee any money in excess of the coinsurance, co-payments or deductibles. Failure of a health carrier to make timely payment of an amount owed to a provider in accordance with the provider's contract shall constitute an unfair claims settlement practice subject to sections 375.1000 to 375.1018.\n\n6. (1) A health carrier shall develop selection standards for participating primary care professionals and each participating health care professional specialty. Such standards shall be in writing and used in determining the selection of health care professionals by the health carrier, its intermediaries and any provider networks with which it contracts. Selection criteria shall not be established in a manner that will:\n\n(a) Allow a health carrier to avoid a high-risk population by excluding a provider because such provider is located in a geographic area that contains a population presenting a risk of higher than average claims, losses or health services utilization; or\n\n(b) Exclude a provider because such provider treats or specializes in treating a population presenting a risk of higher than average claims, losses or health services utilization.\n\n(2) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit a health carrier from declining to select a provider who fails to meet the other legitimate selection criteria of the health carrier developed in compliance with sections 354.600 to 354.636.\n\n(3) The provisions of sections 354.600 to 354.636 shall not require a health carrier, its intermediaries or the provider networks with which it contracts, to employ specific providers or types of providers, or to contract with or retain more providers or types of providers than are necessary to maintain an adequate network.\n\n7. A health carrier shall file its selection standards for participating providers with the director. A health carrier shall also file any subsequent changes to its selection standards with the director. The selection standards shall be made available to licensed health care providers.\n\n8. A health carrier shall notify a participating provider of the provider's responsibilities with respect to the health carrier's applicable administrative policies and programs, including but not limited to payment terms, utilization review, quality assessment and improvement programs, credentialing, grievance procedures, data reporting requirements, confidentiality requirements and any applicable federal or state programs.\n\n9. No contract between a health carrier and a provider for the delivery of health care service, entered into or renewed after August 28, 2001, shall require the mandatory use of a hospitalist. For purposes of this subsection,\"hospitalist\"means a physician who becomes a physician of record at a hospital for a patient of a participating provider and who may return the care of the patient to that participating provider at the end of hospitalization.\n\n10. A health carrier shall not offer an inducement under the managed care plan to a provider to provide less than medically necessary services to an enrollee.\n\n11. A health carrier shall not prohibit a participating provider from advocating in good faith on behalf of enrollees within the utilization review or grievance processes established by the health carrier or a person contracting with the health carrier.\n\n12. A health carrier shall require a provider to make health records available to appropriate state and federal authorities involved in assessing the quality of care but shall not disclose individual identities, or investigating the grievances or complaints of enrollees, and to comply with the applicable state and federal laws related to the confidentiality of medical or health records.\n\n13. The rights and responsibilities of a provider under a contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall not be assigned or delegated by the provider without the prior written consent of the health carrier.\n\n14. A health carrier shall be responsible for ensuring that a participating provider furnishes covered benefits to all enrollees without regard to the enrollee's enrollment in the plan as a private purchaser of the plan or as a participant in a publicly financed program of health care service.\n\n15. A health carrier shall notify the participating providers of their obligations, if any, to collect applicable coinsurance, co-payments or deductibles from enrollees pursuant to the evidence of coverage, or of the providers' obligations, if any, to notify enrollees of their personal financial obligations for noncovered services.\n\n16. A health carrier shall not penalize a provider because the provider, in good faith, reports to state or federal authorities any act or practice by the health carrier that may jeopardize patient health or welfare.\n\n17. A health carrier shall establish a mechanism by which a participating provider may determine in a timely manner whether a person is covered by the carrier.\n\n18. A health carrier shall not discriminate between health care professionals when selecting such professionals for enrollment in the network or when referring enrollees for health care services to be provided by such health care professional who is acting within the scope of his professional license.\n\n19. A health carrier shall establish procedures for resolution of administrative, payment or other disputes between providers and the health carrier.\n\n20. A contract between a health carrier and a provider shall not contain definitions or other provisions that conflict with the definitions or provisions contained in the managed care plan or sections 354.600 to 354.636.\n\n(L. 1997 H.B. 335, A.L. 2001 H.B. 328 & 88)",

Either party to a contract may exercise a right of nonrenewal at the expiration of the contract period set forth therein or upon sixty days' notice to the other party; provided, however, that any nonrenewal shall not constitute a termination for purposes of this section.\n\n4. A health carrier shall develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that a health care professional is regularly informed of information maintained by the health carrier to evaluate the performance or practice of the health care professional. The health carrier shall consult with health care professionals in developing methodologies to collect and analyze health care professional profiling data. The health carrier shall provide any such information and profiling data and analysis to the health care professionals. Such information, data or analysis shall be provided on a periodic basis appropriate to the nature and amount of data and the volume and scope of services provided.

A health carrier shall have a procedure by which an enrollee who needs ongoing care from a specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist. If the health carrier, or the primary care provider in consultation with the medical director of the health carrier and an appropriate specialist, determines that such a standing referral is warranted, the carrier shall make such a referral to a specialist. In no event shall a health carrier be required to permit an enrollee to elect to have a nonparticipating specialist, except pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 of this section. Such referral shall be pursuant to a treatment plan approved by the health carrier in consultation with the primary care provider, the specialist, and the enrollee or the enrollee's designee.
