Registration as a limited liability partnership — renewals — withdrawal of registration — amendment — revocation, effect — fees — false statements, penalty — foreign partnership requirements. —1. To register as a limited liability partnership pursuant to this section, a written application shall be filed with the office of the secretary of state. The application shall set forth:\n\n(1) The name of the partnership;\n\n(2) The address of a registered office and the name and address of a registered agent for service of process required to be maintained by section 358.470;\n\n(3) The number of partners in the partnership at the date of application;\n\n(4) A brief statement of the principal business in which the partnership engages;\n\n(5) That the partnership thereby applies for registration as a registered limited liability partnership; and\n\n(6) Any other information the partnership determines to include in the application.\n\n2. The application shall be signed on behalf of the partnership by a majority of the partners or by one or more partners authorized by a majority in interest of the partners to sign the application on behalf of the partnership.\n\n3. The application shall be accompanied by a fee payable to the secretary of state of twenty-five dollars for each partner of the partnership, but the fee shall not exceed one hundred dollars. All moneys from the payment of this fee shall be deposited into the general revenue fund.\n\n4. A person who files a document according to this section as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of the partner's authority as a prerequisite to filing. Any signature on such document may be a facsimile. If the secretary of state finds that the filing conforms to law, the secretary of state shall:\n\n(1) Endorse on the copy the word \"Filed\" and the month, day and year of the filing;\n\n(2) File the original in the secretary of state's office; and\n\n(3) Return the copy to the person who filed it or to the person's representative.\n\n5. A partnership becomes a registered limited liability partnership on the date of the filing in the office of the secretary of state of an application that, as to form, meets the requirements of subsections 1 and 2 of this section and that is accompanied by the fee specified in subsection 3 of this section, or at any later time specified in the application.\n\n6. An initial application filed under subsection 1 of this section by a partnership registered by the secretary of state as a limited liability partnership expires one year after the date of registration unless earlier withdrawn or revoked or unless renewed in accordance with subsection 9 of this section.\n\n7. If a person is included in the number of partners of a registered limited liability partnership set forth in an application, a renewal application or a certificate of amendment of an application or a renewal application, the inclusion of such person shall not be admissible as evidence in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, for the purpose of determining whether such person is liable as a partner of such registered limited liability partnership. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership and the liability of a partner of such registered limited liability partnership shall not be adversely affected if the number of partners stated in an application, a renewal application or a certificate of amendment of an application or a renewal application is erroneously stated provided that the application, renewal application or certificate of amendment of an application or a renewal application was filed in good faith.\n\n8. Any person who files an application or a renewal application in the office of the secretary of state pursuant to this section shall not be required to file any other documents pursuant to chapter 417 which requires filing for fictitious names.\n\n9. An effective registration may be renewed before its expiration by filing in duplicate with the secretary of state an application containing current information of the kind required in an initial application, including the registration number as assigned by the secretary of state. The renewal application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars on the date of renewal plus, if the renewal increases the number of partners, fifty dollars for each partner added, but the fee shall not exceed two hundred dollars. All moneys from such fees shall be deposited into the general revenue fund. A renewal application filed under this section continues an effective registration for one year after the date the effective registration would otherwise expire.\n\n10. A registration may be withdrawn by filing with the secretary of state a written withdrawal notice signed on behalf of the partnership by a majority of the partners or by one or more partners authorized by a majority of the partners to sign the notice on behalf of the partnership. A withdrawal notice shall include the name of the partnership, the date of registration of the partnership's last application under this section, and a current street address of the partnership's principal office in this state or outside the state, as applicable. A withdrawal notice terminates the registration of the partnership as a limited liability partnership as of the date of filing the notice in the office of the secretary of state. The withdrawal notice shall be accompanied by a filing fee of twenty dollars.\n\n11. If a partnership that has registered pursuant to this section ceases to be registered as provided in subsection 6 or 10 of this section, that fact shall not affect the status of the partnership as a registered limited liability partnership prior to the date the partnership ceased to be registered pursuant to this section.\n\n12. A document filed under this section may be amended or corrected by filing with the secretary of state articles of amendment, signed by a majority of the partners or by one or more partners authorized by a majority of the partners. The articles of amendment shall contain:\n\n(1) The name of the partnership;\n\n(2) The identity of the document being amended;\n\n(3) The part of the document being amended; and\n\n(4) The amendment or correction.­­The articles of amendment shall be accompanied by a filing fee of twenty dollars plus, if the amendment increases the number of partners, fifty dollars for each partner added, but the fee shall not exceed two hundred dollars; provided that no amendment of an application or a renewal application is required as a result of a change after the application or renewal application is filed in the number of partners of the registered limited liability partnership or in the business in which the registered limited liability partnership engages. All moneys from such fees shall be deposited into the general revenue fund. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership shall not be affected by changes after the filing of an application or a renewal application in the information stated in the application or renewal application.\n\n­­The articles of amendment shall be accompanied by a filing fee of twenty dollars plus, if the amendment increases the number of partners, fifty dollars for each partner added, but the fee shall not exceed two hundred dollars; provided that no amendment of an application or a renewal application is required as a result of a change after the application or renewal application is filed in the number of partners of the registered limited liability partnership or in the business in which the registered limited liability partnership engages. All moneys from such fees shall be deposited into the general revenue fund. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership shall not be affected by changes after the filing of an application or a renewal application in the information stated in the application or renewal application.\n\n13. No later than ninety days after the happening of any of the following events, an amendment to an application or a renewal application reflecting the occurrence of the event or events shall be executed and filed by a majority in interest of the partners or by one or more partners authorized by a majority of the partners to execute an amendment to the application or renewal application:\n\n(1) A change in the name of the registered limited liability partnership;\n\n(2) Except as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of section 358.470, a change in the address of the registered office or a change in the name or address of the registered agent of the registered limited liability partnership.\n\n14. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or in the certificate of amendment of an application or a renewal application, a certificate of amendment of an application or a renewal application or a withdrawal notice of an application or a renewal application shall be effective at the time of its filing with the secretary of state.\n\n15. The secretary of state may provide forms for the application specified in subsection 1 of this section, the renewal application specified in subsection 9 of this section, the withdrawal notice specified in subsection 10 of this section, and the amendment or correction specified in subsection 12 of this section.\n\n16. The secretary of state may remove from its active records the registration of a partnership whose registration has been withdrawn, revoked or has expired.\n\n17. The secretary of state may revoke the filing of a document filed under this section if the secretary of state determines that the filing fee for the document was paid by an instrument that was dishonored when presented by the state for payment. The secretary of state shall return the document and give notice of revocation to the filing party by regular mail. Failure to give or receive notice does not invalidate the revocation. A revocation of a filing does not affect an earlier filing.\n\n18. If any person signs a document required or permitted to be filed pursuant to sections 358.440 to 358.500 which the person knows is false in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered on behalf of a partnership to the secretary of state for filing, such person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Unintentional errors in the information set forth in an application filed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, or changes in the information after the filing of the application, shall not affect the status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership.\n\n19. Before transacting business in this state, a foreign registered limited liability partnership shall:\n\n(1) Comply with any statutory or administrative registration or filing requirements governing the specific type of business in which the partnership is engaged; and\n\n(2) Register as a limited liability partnership as provided in this section by filing an application which shall, in addition to the other matters required to be set forth in such application, include a statement:\n\n(a) That the secretary is irrevocably appointed the agent of the foreign limited liability partnership for service of process if the limited liability partnership fails to maintain a registered agent in this state or if the agent cannot be found or served with the exercise of reasonable diligence; and\n\n(b) Of the address of the office required to be maintained in the jurisdiction of its organization by the laws of that jurisdiction or, if not so required, of the principal office of the foreign limited liability partnership.\n\n20. A partnership that registers as a limited liability partnership shall not be deemed to have dissolved as a result thereof and is for all purposes the same partnership that existed before the registration and continues to be a partnership under the laws of this state. If a registered limited liability partnership dissolves, a partnership which is a successor to such registered limited liability partnership and which intends to be a registered limited liability partnership shall not be required to file a new registration and shall be deemed to have filed any documents required or permitted under this chapter which were filed by the predecessor partnership.\n\n21. Fees mandated in subsection 3 of this section shall be waived if a general partner of the partnership is a member of the Missouri National Guard or any other active duty military, resides in the state of Missouri, and provides proof of such service to the secretary of state.\n\n(L. 1995 H.B. 558, A.L. 1997 H.B. 655 merged with S.B. 170, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1664, A.L. 2014 S.B. 600)",

Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a domestic general partnership may merge or consolidate with or into one or more general partnerships formed under the laws of this state or any other jurisdiction, with such general partnership as the agreement shall provide being the surviving or resulting general partnership. A domestic general partnership may merge or consolidate with one or more domestic or foreign limited partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, business trusts, corporations, real estate investment trusts and other associations or business entities at least one of which is not a general partnership, as provided in sections 347.700 to 347.735.\n\n2. The agreement of merger or consolidation shall be approved by the number or percentage of partners specified in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement fails to specify the required partner approval for merger or consolidation of the general partnership, then the agreement of merger or consolidation shall be approved by that number or percentage of partners specified by the partnership agreement to approve an amendment to the partnership agreement. However, if the merger effects a change for which the partnership agreement requires a greater number or percentage of partners than that required to amend the partnership agreement, then the merger or consolidation shall be approved by that greater number or percentage. If the partnership agreement contains no provision specifying the vote required to amend the partnership agreement, then the agreement of merger must be approved by all the partners.\n\n3. In the case of a merger or consolidation of one or more domestic partnerships into a surviving partnership, the surviving partnership shall file articles of merger or consolidation with the secretary of state setting forth:\n\n(1) The name of each party to the merger or consolidation;\n\n(2) The effective date of the merger or consolidation which shall be the date the articles of merger or consolidation are filed with the secretary of state or on a later date set forth in the articles of merger or consolidation not to exceed ninety days after the filing date;\n\n(3) The name of the surviving partnership in a merger or the new partnership in a consolidation and the state of its formation;\n\n(4) A statement that the merger or consolidation was authorized and approved by the partners of each party to the merger or consolidation in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where it was organized;\n\n(5) If applicable, the address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent at such office for the surviving or new partnership;\n\n(6) A statement that the executed agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or new partnership, stating the address of such place of business; and\n\n(7) A statement that a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be furnished by the surviving or new partnership, on request and without cost, to any partner of any entity that is a party to the merger or consolidation.\n\n4. The certificate of merger or consolidation shall be executed by at least one general partner of each domestic partnership and one authorized agent, or its equivalent, for the other party to the merger or consolidation who is duly authorized to execute such notice.\n\n5. If, following a merger or consolidation of one or more domestic partnerships and one or more partnerships formed under the laws of any state, the surviving or resulting partnership is not a domestic partnership, there shall be attached to the articles of merger or consolidation filed pursuant to subsection 3 of this section a certificate executed by the surviving or resulting partnership, stating that such surviving or resulting partnership may be served with process in this state in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of such domestic partnership, irrevocably appointing the secretary of state as such surviving or resulting partnership's agent to accept service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding and specifying the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed to such surviving or resulting partnership to the secretary of state.\n\n6. When the articles of merger or consolidation required by subsection 3 of this section shall have become effective, for all purposes of the laws of this state, all the rights, privileges, franchises and powers of each of the partnerships that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to any of such partnerships, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such partnerships shall be vested in the surviving or resulting partnership, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or resulting partnership as they were of each of the partnerships that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of this state, in any such partnerships, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this section; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any such partnerships shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the partnerships that have merged or consolidated shall thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting partnership, and may be enforced against such surviving or resulting partnership to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by such surviving or resulting partnership.\n\n(L. 1997 H.B. 655 merged with S.B. 170, A.L. 2003 S.B. 394)",
