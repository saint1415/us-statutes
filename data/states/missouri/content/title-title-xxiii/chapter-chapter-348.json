It is hereby found and declared that:\n\n(1) The high and increasing cost of agricultural land, improvements, and equipment creates an urgent demand for financing which is not available in the amounts needed and at reasonable interest rates in the present market, and the inability on the part of persons engaged in agriculture to acquire modern agricultural property at reasonable financing costs makes it difficult for such persons to continue their operations at present levels; and\n\n(2) Such inability to continue agricultural operations decreases employment and results in unemployment and its attendant problems; and\n\n(3) That environmental damage, resulting from air, water, and other pollution and from public water supply, solid waste disposal, noise and other environmental problems, seriously endangers the public health and welfare; and\n\n(4) That the high cost of financing capital improvements and the need to comply with environmental quality standards impose a heavy economic burden on small business in this state; and\n\n(5) That it is desirable to provide small business with additional and alternative methods of financing the costs of acquisition and installation of the devices, equipment, and facilities required to comply with the quality standards which have been established to reduce, control, and prevent pollution and related problems; and\n\n(6) That the viability of small business is threatened by the high cost of obtaining funds to meet general capital improvement programs and that the continued existence of small business enterprise in this state is desirable and necessary for the maintenance and expansion of employment opportunities in and the preservation of the economic well-being of this state; and\n\n(7) It is necessary, desirable, and in the best interest of the citizens of this state that provision be made for the establishment of a public corporation to promote the development of agriculture and small business and to reduce, control, and prevent environmental damage in this state by making available to persons engaged in agriculture in this state and to small businesses located in this state, at interest rates lower than would be otherwise obtainable, funds for use in agriculture operations or for use in the reduction, control, and prevention of environmental damage or, in the case of small business, for use in general capital improvement programs, and to vest such corporation with all powers that may be necessary to enable it to accomplish such purposes; and\n\n(8) It is the intent of the general assembly that such public corporation shall give special consideration to small business, as defined in sections 348.005 to 348.180, in authorizing the issuance of bonds for the financing of agricultural property or pollution control facilities in order to assist small business in assuming the economic burdens imposed by the required financing of such agricultural property or pollution control facilities.\n\n2. Sections 348.005 to 348.180 shall be liberally construed to accomplish the intentions expressed in this section.\n\n(L. 1981 H.B. 681 § 2)",

As used in this section,\"state tax liability\", any state tax liability incurred by a taxpayer under the provisions of chapters 143, 147, and 148, exclusive of the provisions relating to the withholding of tax as provided for in sections 143.191 to 143.265 and related provisions.\n\n2. Any eligible lender under the family farm livestock loan program under section 348.500 shall be entitled to receive a tax credit equal to one hundred percent of the amount of interest waived by the lender under section 348.500 on a qualifying loan for the first year of the loan only. The tax credit shall be evidenced by a tax credit certificate issued by the agricultural and small business development authority and may be used to satisfy the state tax liability of the owner of such certificate that becomes due in the tax year in which the interest on a qualified loan is waived by the lender under section 348.500. No lender may receive a tax credit under this section unless such person presents a tax credit certificate to the department of revenue for payment of such state tax liability. The amount of the tax credits that may be issued to all eligible lenders claiming tax credits authorized in this section in a fiscal year shall not exceed three hundred thousand dollars.\n\n3. The agricultural and small business development authority shall be responsible for the administration and issuance of the certificate of tax credits authorized by this section. The authority shall issue a certificate of tax credit at the request of any lender. Each request shall include a true copy of the loan documents, the name of the lender who is to receive a certificate of tax credit, the type of state tax liability against which the tax credit is to be used, and the amount of the certificate of tax credit to be issued to the lender based on the interest waived by the lender under section 348.500 on the loan for the first year.\n\n4. The Missouri department of revenue shall accept a certificate of tax credit in lieu of other payment in such amount as is equal to the lesser of the amount of the tax or the remaining unused amount of the credit as indicated on the certificate of tax credit, and shall indicate on the certificate of tax credit the amount of tax thereby paid and the date of such payment.\n\n5. The following provisions shall apply to tax credits authorized under this section:\n\n(1) Tax credits claimed in a taxable year may be claimed on a quarterly basis and applied to the estimated quarterly tax of the lender;\n\n(2) Any amount of tax credit which exceeds the tax due, including any estimated quarterly taxes paid by the lender under subdivision (1) of this subsection which results in an overpayment of taxes for a taxable year, shall not be refunded but may be carried over to any subsequent taxable year, not to exceed a total of three years for which a tax credit may be taken for a qualified family farm livestock loan;\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a lender may assign, transfer or sell tax credits authorized under this section, with the new owner of the tax credit receiving the same rights in the tax credit as the lender. For any tax credits assigned, transferred, sold, or otherwise conveyed, a notarized endorsement shall be filed by the lender with the authority specifying the name and address of the new owner of the tax credit and the value of such tax credit; and\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, any commercial bank may use tax credits created under this section as provided in section 148.064 and receive a net tax credit against taxes actually paid in the amount of the first year's interest on loans made under this section. If such first year tax credits reduce taxes due as provided in section 148.064 to zero, the remaining tax credits may be carried over as otherwise provided in this section and utilized as provided in section 148.064 in subsequent years.\n\n(L. 2006 S.B. 1017, A.L. 2008 S.B. 931)",
