Each limited partnership shall continuously maintain in this state:\n\n(1) A registered office which may be, but need not be, a place of its business in this state; and\n\n(2) A registered agent for service of process on the limited partnership, which agent may be either an individual, resident in this state, whose business office is identical with such registered office, or a domestic corporation or a foreign corporation authorized to do business in this state, whose business office is identical with such registered office.\n\n2. A limited partnership may from time to time change the address of its registered office. A limited partnership shall change its registered agent if the office of registered agent shall become vacant for any reason, if its registered agent becomes disqualified or incapacitated to act, or if the limited partnership revokes the appointment of its registered agent. A limited partnership may change the address of its registered office or change its registered agent, or both, by filing in the office of the secretary of state, on a form approved by the secretary of state, a statement setting forth:\n\n(1) The name of the limited partnership;\n\n(2) The address, including street and number, if any, of its then registered office;\n\n(3) If the address of its registered office be changed, the address, including street and number, if any, to which the registered office is to be changed;\n\n(4) The name of its then registered agent;\n\n(5) If its registered agent be changed, the name of its successor registered agent and the successor registered agent's written consent to the appointment either on the statement or attached thereto;\n\n(6) That the address of its registered office and the address of the business office of its registered agent, as changed, will be identical; and\n\n(7) That such change was authorized by the limited partnership.\n\n3. Such statement shall be executed in duplicate by the limited partnership by a general partner, and delivered to the secretary of state. The execution of such a statement by a general partner constitutes an affirmation under the penalties of section 575.040 that the facts stated therein are true. If the secretary of state finds that such statement conforms to the provisions of this chapter, the secretary of state shall file the same, keeping the original and returning the other copy to the limited partnership or to its representative.\n\n4. The change of address of the registered office, or the change of the registered agent, or both, as the case may be, shall become effective upon the filing of such statement by the secretary of state. The location or residence of any limited partnership shall be deemed for all purposes to be in the county where its registered office is maintained.\n\n5.

The change of address of the registered office shall become effective upon the filing of the statement to the secretary of state.\n\n6. In the event that a limited partnership shall fail to appoint or maintain a registered agent in this state, then the secretary of state, as long as such default exists, shall be automatically appointed as an agent of such limited partnership upon whom any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon the limited partnership may be served. Service on the secretary of state of any process, notice or demand against a limited partnership shall be made by delivering to and leaving with the secretary of state, or with any clerk having charge of the limited partnership department of the secretary of state's office, a copy of such process, notice or demand. In the event that any process, notice, or demand is served on the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall immediately cause a copy thereof to be forwarded by registered mail, addressed to the limited partnership at its registered office in this state. Nothing herein contained shall limit or affect the right to serve any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon a limited partnership in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 512 & 650, A.L. 1998 S.B. 844, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1664)",

Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a domestic limited partnership may merge or consolidate with or into one or more limited partnerships formed under the laws of this state or any other jurisdiction, with such limited partnership as the agreement shall provide being the surviving or resulting limited partnership. A domestic limited partnership may merge or consolidate with one or more domestic or foreign general partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, business trusts, corporations, real estate investment trusts and other associations or business entities at least one of which is not a limited partnership, as provided in sections 347.700 to 347.735.\n\n2. The agreement of merger or consolidation shall be approved by the number or percentage of general and limited partners specified in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement fails to specify the required partner approval for merger or consolidation of the limited partnership, then the agreement of merger or consolidation shall be approved by that number or percentage of general and limited partners specified by the partnership agreement to approve an amendment to the partnership agreement. However, if the merger effects a change for which the partnership agreement requires a greater number or percentage of general and limited partners than that required to amend the partnership agreement, then the merger or consolidation shall be approved by that greater number or percentage. If the partnership agreement contains no provision specifying the vote required to amend the partnership agreement, then the agreement of merger must be approved by all the general and limited partners.\n\n3. In the case of a merger or consolidation of one or more domestic limited partnerships into a surviving limited partnership, the surviving limited partnership shall file articles of merger or consolidation with the secretary of state setting forth:\n\n(1) The name of each party to the merger or consolidation;\n\n(2) The effective date of the merger or consolidation which shall be the date the articles of merger or consolidation are filed with the secretary or on a later date set forth in the articles of merger or consolidation not to exceed ninety days after the filing date;\n\n(3) The name of the surviving limited partnership in a merger or the new limited partnership in a consolidation and the state of its formation;\n\n(4) A statement that the merger or consolidation was authorized and approved by the partners of each party to the merger or consolidation in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where it was organized;\n\n(5) If applicable, the address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent at such office for the surviving or new limited partnership;\n\n(6) In the case of a merger in which a domestic limited partnership is the surviving entity, such amendments or changes to the certificate of limited partnership of the surviving limited partnership as are desired to be effected by the merger, or, if no such amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of limited partnership of the surviving limited partnership shall not be amended or changed as a result of the merger;\n\n(7) In the case of a consolidation in which a domestic limited partnership is the continuing limited partnership, the certificate of limited partnership of the new domestic limited partnership shall be set forth in an attachment to the certificate of consolidation;\n\n(8) A statement that the executed agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or new limited partnership, stating the address of such place of business; and\n\n(9) A statement that a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be furnished by the surviving or new limited partnership, on request and without cost, to any partner of any entity that is a party to the merger or consolidation.\n\n4. The certificate of merger or consolidation shall be executed by at least one general partner of each domestic limited partnership and one authorized agent, or its equivalent, for the other party to the merger or consolidation who is duly authorized to execute such notice.\n\n5. In the case of a merger of one or more domestic limited partnerships into a surviving limited partnership, the certificate of limited partnership of the surviving domestic limited partnership shall be amended to the extent provided in the articles of merger and the certificates of limited partnership of each other domestic limited partnership shall be deemed cancelled by the filing of the articles of merger with the secretary of state.\n\n6. If, following a merger or consolidation of one or more domestic limited partnerships and one or more limited partnerships formed under the laws of any state, the surviving or resulting limited partnership is not a domestic limited partnership, there shall be attached to the articles of merger or consolidation filed pursuant to subsection 3 of this section a certificate executed by the surviving or resulting limited partnership, stating that such surviving or resulting limited partnership may be served with process in this state in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of such domestic limited partnership, irrevocably appointing the secretary of state as such surviving or resulting limited partnership's agent to accept service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding and specifying the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed to such surviving or resulting limited partnership to the secretary of state.\n\n7.

This authority shall consist of, but is not limited to, the following powers:\n\n(1) (a) The power to examine the books and records of any limited partnership to which this chapter applies, and it shall be the duty of any general partner or agent of such limited partnership to produce such books and records for examination on demand of the secretary of state or designated employee; provided, that no person shall be subject to any criminal prosecution on account of any matter or thing which may be disclosed by the examination of any limited partnership books, or records, which they may produce or exhibit for examination; or on account of any matter or thing concerning which they may make any voluntary and truthful statement in writing to the secretary of state, or designated employee. All facts obtained in the examination of the books and records of any limited partnership, or through voluntary sworn statement of any partner, agent, or employee of any limited partnership, shall be treated as confidential, except insofar as official duty may require the disclosure of same; or when such facts are material to any issue in any legal proceeding in which the secretary of state or designated employee may be a party or called as a witness, and, if the secretary of state or designated employee shall, except as herein provided, disclose any information relative to the private accounts, affairs, and transactions of any such limited partnership, he shall be deemed guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\n\n(b) If any general partner, or registered agent, of any such limited partnership shall refuse the demand of the secretary of state, or designated employee, to exhibit the books and records of such limited partnership for examination, he, or they, shall be deemed guilty of a class B misdemeanor.\n\n(2) (a) The power to cancel or disapprove any certificate of limited partnership or other filing required under this chapter, if the limited partnership fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter by failing to file required documents under this chapter by failing to maintain a registered agent, by failing to pay the required filing fees, by using fraud or deception in effecting any filing, by filing a required document containing a false statement, or by violating any section or sections of the criminal laws of Missouri, the federal government or any other state of the United States. Thirty days before such cancellation shall take effect, the secretary of state shall notify the limited partnership with written notice, either personally or by mail. If mailed, the notice shall be deemed delivered five days after it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to such limited partnership's last registered agent and office or to one of the limited partnership's general partners. The written notice of the secretary of state's proposed cancellation to the limited partnership, domestic or foreign, will specify the reasons for such action.\n\n(b) The limited partnership may appeal this notice of proposed cancellation to the circuit court of the county in which the registered office of such limited partnership is or is proposed to be situated by filing with the clerk of such court a petition setting forth a copy of the certificate of limited partnership or other relevant documents and a copy of the proposed written cancellation thereof by the secretary of state, such petition to be filed within thirty days after notice of such cancellation shall have been given, and the matter shall be tried by the court, and the court shall either sustain the action of the secretary of state or direct him to take such action as the court may deem proper. An appeal from the circuit court in such a case shall be allowed as in civil action.\n\n(c) The limited partnership may provide information to the secretary of state that would allow the secretary of state to withdraw the notice of proposed cancellation. This information may consist of, but need not be limited to, corrected statements and documents, new filings, affidavits and certified copies of other filed documents.\n\n(3) The power to rescind a cancellation provided for in subsection 2 of this section upon compliance with either of the following:\n\n(a) The affected limited partnership provides the necessary documents and affidavits indicating the limited partnership has corrected the conditions causing the proposed cancellation or the cancellation;\n\n(b) The limited partnership provides the correct statements or documentation that the limited partnership is not in violation of any section of the criminal code.\n\n(4) The power to charge late filing fees for any filing fee required under this chapter. Late filing fees shall be assessed at a rate of ten dollars for each thirty-day period of delinquency.\n\n(5) (a) The power to administratively cancel a certificate of limited partnership if the limited partnership's period of duration stated in the certificate of limited partnership expires.\n\n(b) Not less than thirty days before such administrative cancellation shall take effect, the secretary of state shall notify the limited partnership with written notice, either personally or by mail. If mailed, the notice shall be deemed delivered five days after it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to such limited partnership's last registered agent and office or to one of the limited partnership's general partners.\n\n(c) If the limited partnership does not timely file a certificate of amendment in accordance with section 359.101 to extend the duration of the limited partnership, which may be any number of years or perpetual, or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that the period of duration determined by the secretary of state is incorrect, within sixty days after service of the notice is perfected by posting with the United States Postal Service, then the secretary of state shall cancel the certificate of limited partnership by signing a certificate of administrative cancellation that recites the grounds for cancellation and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the limited partnership as provided in section 359.141.\n\n(d) A limited partnership whose certificate of limited partnership has been administratively cancelled continues its existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 359.471 and notify claimants under section 359.481.\n\n(e) The administrative cancellation of a certificate of limited partnership does not terminate the authority of its registered agent.\n\n(6) (a) The power to rescind an administrative cancellation and reinstate the certificate of limited partnership.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, a limited partnership whose certificate of limited partnership has been administratively cancelled under subdivision (5) of this section may file a certificate of amendment in accordance with section 359.101 to extend the duration of the limited partnership, which may be any number or perpetual.\n\n(c) A limited partnership whose certificate of limited partnership has been administratively cancelled under subdivision (5) of this section may apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement. The applicant shall:\n\na. Recite the name of the limited partnership and the effective date of its administrative cancellation;\n\nb. State that the grounds for cancellation either did not exist or have been eliminated, as applicable, and be accompanied by documentation satisfactory to the secretary of state evidencing the same;\n\nc. State that the limited partnership's name satisfies the requirements of section 359.021;\n\nd. Be accompanied by a reinstatement fee in the amount of one hundred dollars, or such greater amount as required by state regulation, plus any delinquent fees, penalties, and other charges as determined by the secretary of state to then be due.\n\n(d) If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information and is accompanied by the fees required in paragraph (c) of this subdivision and that the information and fees are correct, the secretary of state shall rescind the certificate of administrative cancellation and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his or her determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the limited partnership as provided in section 359.141.\n\n(e) When the reinstatement is effective, it shall relate back to and take effect as of the effective date of the administrative cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership and the limited partnership may continue carrying on its business as if the administrative cancellation had never occurred.\n\n(f) In the event the name of the limited partnership was reissued by the secretary of state to another entity prior to the time application for reinstatement was filed, the limited partnership applying for reinstatement may elect to reinstate using a new name that complies with the requirements of section 359.021 and that has been approved by appropriate action of the limited partnership for changing the name thereof.\n\n(g) If the secretary of state denies a limited partnership's application for reinstatement following administrative cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership, he or she shall serve the limited partnership as provided in section 359.141 with a written notice that explains the reason or reasons for denial.\n\n(h) The limited partnership may appeal a denial of reinstatement as provided for in paragraph (b) of subdivision (2) of this section.\n\n(7) Subdivision (6) of this section shall apply to any limited partnership whose certificate of limited partnership was cancelled because such limited partnership's period of duration stated in the certificate of limited partnership expired on or after August 28, 2003.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 512 & 650, A.L. 2009 H.B. 481 merged with S.B. 217)",
