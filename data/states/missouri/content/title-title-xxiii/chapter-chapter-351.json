Power to issue shares — preferences — procedure — redemption of stock by corporation, requirements — amended certificate of designation for classes or series adversely affecting holders, majority vote of holders required. —1. Every corporation may issue one or more classes of stock or one or more series of stock within any class thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par value and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of its articles of incorporation. Any of the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any such class or series of stock may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the articles of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or outside the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by its articles of incorporation, provided that the manner in which such facts shall operate upon the voting powers, designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such class or series of stock is clearly and expressly set forth in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors. The power to increase or decrease or otherwise adjust the capital stock as provided in this chapter shall apply to all or any such classes of stock.\n\n2. (1) Subject to the provisions of section 351.200, the stock of any class or series may be made subject to redemption by the corporation at its option or at the option of the holders of such stock or upon the happening of a specified event; provided, that at the time of such redemption the corporation shall have outstanding shares of at least one class or series of stock with full voting powers which shall not be subject to redemption. Notwithstanding the limitation stated in the foregoing provision:\n\n(a) Any stock of a regulated investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, may be made subject to redemption by the corporation at its option or at the option of the holders of such stock;\n\n(b) Any stock of a corporation which holds, directly or indirectly, a license, franchise, or contract from a governmental agency to conduct its business or is a member of a national securities exchange, which license, franchise, contract, or membership is conditioned upon some or all of the holders of its stock possessing the prescribed qualifications, may be made subject to redemption by the corporation to the extent necessary to prevent the loss of such license, franchise or membership or to reinstate it.\n\n(2) Any stock which may be redeemable under this section may be redeemed for cash, property or rights, including securities of the same or another corporation, at such time or times, price or prices, or rate or rates, and with such adjustments, as shall be stated in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors as hereinabove provided.\n\n3. The holders of preferred or special stock of any class or of any series thereof shall be entitled to receive dividends at such rates, on such conditions and at such times as shall be stated in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors as hereinabove provided, payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or of any other series of stock, and cumulative or noncumulative as shall be so stated and expressed. When dividends upon the preferred and special stocks, if any, to the extent of the preference to which such stocks are entitled, have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, a dividend on the remaining class or classes or series of stock may then be paid out of the remaining assets of the corporation available for dividends as is provided elsewhere in this chapter.\n\n4. The holders of the preferred or special stock of any class or of any series thereof are entitled to such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the corporation as is stated in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors as hereinabove provided.\n\n5. Any stock of any class or of any series thereof may be made convertible into, or exchangeable for, at the option of either the holder or the corporation or upon the happening of a specified event, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation, at such price or prices or at such rate or rates of exchange and with such adjustments as is stated in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors as hereinabove provided.\n\n6. If any corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation issues to represent such class or series of stock in the case of shares represented by a certificate; but, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation issues to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. The corporation shall also furnish such information upon request to holders of uncertificated shares.\n\n7. When any corporation desires to issue any shares of stock of any class or of any series of any class of which the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, have not been set forth in the articles of incorporation or in any amendment thereto, but are provided for in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of the articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto, a certificate of designations setting forth a copy of such resolution or resolutions and the number of shares of stock of such class or series as to which the resolution or resolutions apply shall be executed by the president or any vice president and filed by the corporation with the secretary of state. Unless otherwise provided in any such resolution or resolutions, the number of shares of stock of any such class or series to which such resolution or resolutions apply may be increased, but not above the number of shares of the class authorized by the articles of incorporation with respect to which the powers, designations, preferences and rights have not been set forth, or decreased, but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding, by a certificate likewise executed and filed setting forth a statement that a specified increase or decrease therein had been authorized and directed by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by the board of directors. In case the number of such shares shall be decreased, the number of shares so specified in the certificate shall resume their status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution or resolutions creating such shares. When no shares of any such class or series are outstanding, either because none were issued or because no issued shares of any such class or series remain outstanding, a certificate setting forth a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors that none of the authorized shares of such class or series are outstanding, and that none will be issued subject to the certificate of designations previously filed with respect to such class or series, may be executed by the president or any vice president and filed by the corporation with the secretary of state and, when such certificate becomes effective, it shall have the effect of eliminating from the articles of incorporation all reference to such class or series of stock. When shares of stock of any class or of any series of any class of which the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, have not been set forth in the articles of incorporation or in any amendment thereto, but are provided in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of the articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto, the board of directors may, by resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors, amend the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, of any such class or series by filing an amended certificate of designations setting forth a copy of such resolution or resolutions, which shall include the terms and conditions of such amendment, executed by the president or any vice president and filed by the corporation with the secretary of state. Provided, however, that if any shares of any such class or series shall be issued and outstanding at the time of such filing, such amendment, if it adversely affects the holders thereof, shall not become effective unless as to any such class or series, a majority of the holders thereof, or such greater vote as the articles of incorporation or any amendment thereto require, adopts such amendment, and the certificate of designations shall state that such approval has been obtained. When any certificate is filed under this subsection, it shall have the effect of amending the articles of incorporation and shall become effective as provided in subsection 1 of section 351.105.\n\n(RSMo 1939 §§ 5359, 5543, A.L. 1943 p. 410 § 12, A.L. 1975 S.B. 14, A.L. 1986 S.B. 565, A.L. 1995 H.B. 558, A.L. 1997 S.B. 197, A.L. 1998 S.B. 680, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1664, A.L. 2005 H.B. 678)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 5100",

Any corporation which issued preferred shares prior to November 21, 1943, the issued certificates evidencing which shares contain no provision for redemption, and which corporation has no provision in its articles of incorporation providing for the redemption of such shares, may redeem all of such shares at the par or stated value thereof plus, in the case of cumulative preferred shares, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of redemption; provided, that the corporation shall proceed in the following manner:\n\n(1) The board of directors may adopt a resolution recommending the redemption and directing the submission of the resolution for approval or rejection by a vote of all the shareholders of the corporation, each share entitling the holder to one vote, whether by the terms of the articles of incorporation the shareholder is entitled to vote or not, and such vote may be at either an annual or a special meeting, except that the proposed redemption need not be adopted by the board of directors and may be directly submitted to any annual or special meeting of shareholders;\n\n(2) Written or printed notice stating that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider and vote upon the adoption or rejection of a resolution providing for the redemption of the preferred shares shall be given to each shareholder of record within the time and in the manner provided by this chapter for the giving of notice of meetings of shareholders; if the meeting is an annual meeting, the purpose shall, nevertheless, be included in the notice of the annual meeting;\n\n(3) At the meeting the shareholders may adopt the resolution for the redemption of all of such preferred shares, and may authorize the board of directors to fix the terms and conditions thereof. The authorization shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least three-fifths of the outstanding shares of the corporation. In the event that the redemption of the preferred shares is authorized by a vote of the shareholders of the corporation, any holder of a preferred share or of preferred shares who did not vote in favor thereof, and who, at or prior to the meeting at which the redemption was submitted to a vote of the shareholders, shall file with the corporation written objections thereto, may, within twenty days after the vote was taken, make written demand on the corporation for the payment to him of the fair value of his preferred shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken authorizing the redemption. The demand shall state the number of preferred shares owned by the dissenting shareholder. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the twenty-day period shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the redemption of the preferred shares at their par or stated value plus, in the case of cumulative preferred shares, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of redemption, and shall be bound by the terms of the resolution.\n\n2. If, within thirty days after the date on which the vote was taken, the value of the preferred shares is agreed upon between the dissenting shareholder and the corporation, the corporation shall make payment of the agreed value within ninety days after the date on which the vote was taken authorizing the redemption, upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in the shares.\n\n3. If within the period of thirty days, the shareholder and the corporation do not so agree, then the dissenting shareholder may, within sixty days after the expiration of the thirty-day period, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction within the county in which the registered office of the corporation is situated, asking for a finding and determination of the fair value of the shares, and shall be entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value as of the day prior to the day upon which the vote was taken, together with interest thereon to the date of the judgment. The judgment shall be payable only upon and simultaneously with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon the payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in the shares.

Any corporation may elect its directors for one or more years, not to exceed three years, the time of service and mode of classification to be provided for by the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation; but, there shall be an annual election for such number or proportion of directors as may be found upon dividing the entire number of directors by the number of years composing a term. At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each annual meeting thereafter the shareholders entitled to vote shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except as herein provided. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he is elected or until his successor shall have been elected and qualified.\n\n2. The articles of incorporation may confer upon holders of any class or series of stock the right to elect one or more directors who shall serve for such term and shall have such voting powers as shall be stated in the articles of incorporation. The terms of office and voting powers of the directors elected in the manner so provided in the articles of incorporation may be greater than or less than those of any other director or class of directors. If the articles of incorporation provide that directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, every reference in this chapter to a majority or other proportion of directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes such directors are entitled to cast.\n\n3. At a meeting called expressly for that purpose, directors may be removed in the manner provided in this section. Such meeting shall be held at the registered office or principal business office of the corporation in this state or in the city or county in this state in which the principal business office of the corporation is located. Unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws provide otherwise, one or more directors or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. If the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against such director's removal would be sufficient to elect such director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors, or, if there be classes of directors, at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part.

Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, to the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsections 1 and 2 of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.\n\n4. Any indemnification under subsections 1 and 2 of this section, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this section. The determination shall be made by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding, or if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or by the shareholders.\n\n5.

Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit the power of the corporation under subsection 6 of this section to enact bylaws or to enter into agreements without shareholder adoption of the same.\n\n8. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or another arrangement on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this section. Without limiting the power of the corporation to procure or maintain any kind of insurance or other arrangement the corporation may for the benefit of persons indemnified by the corporation create a trust fund, establish any form of self insurance, secure its indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other lien on the assets of the corporation, or establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement.

If within such period of thirty days the shareholder and the corporation do not so agree, then the dissenting shareholder may, within sixty days after the expiration of the thirty-day period, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction within the county in which the registered office of the corporation is situated asking for a finding and determination of the fair value of such shares, and shall be entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of such fair value as of the day prior to the date on which such vote was taken, together with interest thereon to the date of such judgment. The judgment shall be payable only upon and simultaneously with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing said shares. Upon the payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in such shares or in the corporation. Unless the dissenting shareholder shall file such petition within the time herein limited, such shareholder and all persons claiming under him shall be conclusively presumed to have approved and ratified the sale or exchange and shall be bound by the terms thereof.\n\n4. The rights of a dissenting shareholder to be paid the fair value of his shares as herein provided shall cease if and when the corporation shall abandon the sale or exchange or the shareholders shall revoke the authority to make such sale or exchange.\n\n5. Shares acquired by the corporation pursuant to the payment of the agreed value thereof or to the payment of judgment entered therefor, as in this section provided, may be held and disposed of by the corporation as it shall see fit.\n\n6. This section shall not apply to any sale, exchange or other disposition of assets of a corporation authorized by a vote of the shareholders of the corporation if, prior to or in connection with such authorization, the shareholders have consented to or approved the voluntary dissolution of the corporation pursuant to section 351.464 or 351.466, if the sale, exchange or other disposition is made in liquidation of the corporation's business and affairs as provided in section 351.476.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 410 § 73, A.L. 1979 S.B. 216, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1432)",

Unless, before the control share acquisition, the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that this section does not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of the corporation, control shares of an issuing public corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have only such voting rights as are conferred by subsection 5 of this section.\n\n2. Any person who proposes to make or has made a control share acquisition may at the person's election deliver an acquiring person statement to the issuing public corporation at the issuing public corporation's principal office. The acquiring person statement must set forth all of the following:\n\n(1) The identity of the acquiring person and each other member of any group of which the person is a part for purposes of determining control shares;\n\n(2) A statement that the acquiring person statement is given pursuant to this section;\n\n(3) The number of shares of the issuing public corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the acquiring person and each other member of the group;\n\n(4) The range of voting power under which the control share acquisition falls or would, if consummated, fall;\n\n(5) If the control share acquisition has not taken place:\n\n(a) A description in reasonable detail of the terms of the proposed control share acquisition; and\n\n(b) Representations of the acquiring person, together with a statement in reasonable detail of the facts upon which they are based, that the proposed control share acquisition, if consummated, will not be contrary to law, and that the acquiring person has the financial capacity to make the proposed control share acquisition.\n\n3.

If a shareholder shall file with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of shareholders at which the voting rights to be accorded any control shares are submitted to a vote, a written objection to such voting rights being accorded any control shares, and shall not vote in favor thereof, and such shareholder, within twenty days after approval of voting rights being accorded any control shares, shall make written demand on the corporation for payment of the fair value of his shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving voting rights being accorded any control shares, the corporation shall pay to such shareholder, upon surrender of his certificate or certificates representing such shares, the fair value of his shares. Such demand shall state the number and class of the shares owned by such dissenting shareholder. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the twenty-day period provided in this subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the control share acquisition.\n\n7. If within thirty days after the date of approval of voting rights being accorded any control shares the value of such shares is agreed upon between the dissenting shareholder and the corporation, payment for the shares shall be made within ninety days after approval of voting rights being accorded any control shares, upon the surrender of his certificate or certificates representing such shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in such shares or in the corporation.\n\n8.

The judgment shall be payable only upon and simultaneously with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Upon the payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in such shares, or in the corporation.

Any other entity may convert to a corporation of this state by complying with subsection 8 of this section and filing in the office of the secretary of state:\n\n(1) A certificate of conversion to corporation that has been executed in accordance with subsection 9 of this section and filed in accordance with section 351.046; and\n\n(2) Articles of incorporation that have been executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with section 351.046.\n\n3.

A corporation of this state may, upon the authorization of such conversion in accordance with this section, convert to a limited liability company, statutory trust, business trust or association, real estate investment trust, common law trust or any other unincorporated business including a partnership (whether general (including a limited liability partnership) or limited (including a limited liability limited partnership)) or a foreign corporation.\n\n2. The board of directors of the corporation which desires to convert under this section shall adopt a resolution approving such conversion, specifying the type of entity into which the corporation shall be converted and recommending the approval of such conversion by the shareholders of the corporation. Such resolution shall be submitted to the shareholders of the corporation at an annual or special meeting. Due notice of the time and purpose of the meeting shall be mailed to each holder of stock, whether voting or nonvoting, of the corporation at the address of the shareholder as it appears on the records of the corporation, at least twenty days prior to the date of the meeting.

The secretary of state is authorized to issue such rules and regulations with respect to such service as the secretary of state deems necessary or appropriate. In the event of such service upon the secretary of state in accordance with subdivision (5) of this subsection, the secretary of state shall forthwith notify such corporation that has converted out of the state of Missouri by letter, directed to such corporation that has converted out of the state of Missouri at the address so specified, unless such corporation shall have designated in writing to the secretary of state a different address for such purpose, in which case it shall be mailed to the last address designated. Such letter shall be sent by a mail or courier service that includes a record of mailing or deposit with the courier and a record of delivery evidenced by the signature of the recipient. Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served on the secretary of state under this subsection. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the secretary of state that service is being effected under this subsection and to pay the secretary of state the sum of fifty dollars for the use of the state, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff shall prevail therein.

Such certificate of the secretary of state shall be prima facie evidence of the conversion by such corporation.\n\n5. The conversion of a corporation in accordance with this section and the resulting cessation of its existence as a corporation of this state pursuant to a certificate of conversion shall not be deemed to affect any obligations or liabilities of the corporation incurred prior to such conversion or the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such conversion, nor shall it be deemed to affect the choice of law applicable to the corporation with respect to matters arising prior to such conversion.\n\n6. Unless otherwise provided in a resolution of conversion adopted in accordance with this section, the converting corporation shall not be required to wind up its affairs or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets, and the conversion shall not constitute a dissolution of such corporation.\n\n7. In connection with a conversion of a domestic corporation to another entity under this section, shares of stock of the corporation of this state which is to be converted may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the entity to which the corporation of this state is being converted or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, shares of stock, rights or securities of, or interests in, another domestic corporation or other entity or may be cancelled.\n\n8.

No vote of shareholders of a corporation shall be necessary to authorize a conversion if no shares of the stock of such corporation shall have been issued prior to the adoption by the board of directors of the resolution approving the conversion.\n\n10.

The definitions in this subsection apply to this section.\n\n2. (1)\"Cooperative\"includes a domestic or foreign cooperative that was the predecessor of the cooperative referred to in this section in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor's existence ceased upon consummation of the transaction.\n\n(2)\"Official capacity\"means:\n\n(a) With respect to a director, the position of director in a cooperative;\n\n(b) With respect to a person other than a director, the elective or appointive office or position held by the person, member of a committee of the board, the employment relationship undertaken by an employee of the cooperative, or the scope of the services provided by members who provide services to the cooperative; and\n\n(c) With respect to a director, chief executive officer, member, or employee of the cooperative who, while a member, director, chief executive officer, or employee of the cooperative, is or was serving at the request of the cooperative or whose duties in that position involve or involved service as a director, manager, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another organization or employee benefit plan, the position of that person as a director, manager, officer, member, partner, trustee, employee, or agent, as the case may be, of the other organization or employee benefit plan.\n\n(3)\"Proceeding\"means a threatened, pending, or completed civil, criminal, administrative, arbitration, or investigative proceeding, including a proceeding by or in the right of the cooperative.\n\n3. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection 5 of this section, a cooperative may indemnify a person made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of the former or present official capacity of the person against judgments, penalties, fines, including, without limitation, excise taxes assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan, settlements, and reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding, if, with respect to the acts or omissions of the person complained of in the proceeding, the person:\n\n(a) Has not been indemnified, or if indemnified, then not fully indemnified by another organization or employee benefit plan for the same judgments, penalties, fines, including, without limitation, excise taxes assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan, settlements, and reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding with respect to the same acts or omissions;\n\n(b) Acted in good faith;\n\n(c) Received no improper personal benefit and the person has not committed an act for which liability cannot be eliminated or limited under subsection 2 of section 351.1078;\n\n(d) In the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful; and\n\na. In the case of acts or omissions occurring in the official capacity described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision (2) of subsection 2*of this section, reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interests of the cooperative, or in the case of acts or omissions occurring in the official capacity described in paragraph (c) of subdivision (2) of subsection 2*of this section, reasonably believed that the conduct was not opposed to the best interests of the cooperative. If the person's acts or omissions complained of in the proceeding relate to conduct as a director, officer, trustee, employee, or agent of an employee benefit plan, the conduct is not considered to be opposed to the best interests of the cooperative if the person reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interests of the participants or beneficiaries of the employee benefit plan; or\n\nb. Was not at the time of the acts or omissions complained of in the proceeding a director, chief executive officer, or person possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of the cooperative.\n\n(2) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent does not, of itself, establish that the person did not meet the criteria set forth in this section.\n\n4. Subject to the provisions of subsection 5 of this section, if a person is made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding, such person shall be entitled, upon written request to the board, to payment or reimbursement by the cooperative of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements incurred by the person in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding, provided that:\n\n(1) Upon receipt by the cooperative of a written affirmation by the person of a good faith belief that the criteria for indemnification set forth in subsection 3 of this section has been satisfied, such person makes a written undertaking, in a form acceptable to the cooperative, to repay all amounts paid or reimbursed by the cooperative, if it is ultimately determined that the criteria for indemnification have not been satisfied, which written undertaking is an unlimited general obligation of the person making it, but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make payment; and\n\n(2) Those making the determination determine that the facts then known would not preclude indemnification under subsection 3 of this section.\n\n5. The articles or bylaws may prohibit indemnification or advances of expenses otherwise required by this section or may impose conditions on indemnification or advances of expenses in addition to the conditions contained in subsections 3 and 4 of this section, including, without limitation, monetary limits on indemnification or advances of expenses if the conditions apply equally to all persons or to all persons within a given class. A prohibition or limit on indemnification or advances of expenses shall not apply to or affect the right of a person to indemnification or advances of expenses with respect to any acts or omissions of the person occurring before the effective date of a provision in the articles or the date of adoption of a provision in the bylaws establishing the prohibition or limit on indemnification or advances of expenses.\n\n6. This section shall not require or limit the ability of a cooperative to reimburse expenses, including attorney fees and disbursements, incurred by a person in connection with an appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the person has not been made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding.\n\n7. Unless otherwise set forth in the articles or bylaws, all determinations whether indemnification of a person is required because the criteria set forth in subsection 4 of this section has been satisfied and whether a person is entitled to payment or reimbursement of expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding as provided in subsection 3 of this section shall be made:\n\n(1) By a majority of the board at a meeting where a quorum is present, provided that the directors who are, at the time, parties to the proceeding are not counted for determining either a majority or the presence of a quorum;\n\n(2) If a quorum of the board under subdivision (1) of this subsection cannot be obtained, then by a majority of a committee of the board consisting solely of two or more directors who are not, at the time, parties to the proceeding, but who are duly designated to make such a determination by a majority of the board, which majority includes directors who are, at the time, parties to the proceeding;\n\n(3) If a determination is not made under subdivisions (1) or (2) of this subsection, then by legal counsel selected either by a majority of the board in the manner set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection, provided a quorum can be obtained, or by a committee by vote in the manner set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection, provided a committee can be established by a majority of the board, including directors who are parties to the proceeding; or\n\n(4) If a determination is not made under subdivisions (1) to (3) of this subsection inclusive, then by the affirmative vote of the members, but the membership interests held by parties to the proceeding shall not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum, and are not considered to be present and entitled to vote on the determination.\n\n8. A cooperative may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person in that person's official capacity against any liability asserted against and incurred by the person in or arising from that person's official capacity, whether or not the cooperative would have been required to indemnify the person against the liability under the provisions of this section.\n\n9. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of the cooperative to indemnify persons other than a director, chief executive officer, member, employee, or member of a committee of the board by contract or otherwise.\n\n(L. 2011 S.B. 366)\n\n*\"Subsection 1\" appears in original rolls.",

A patron member of a cooperative is entitled to one vote on an issue to be voted upon by patron members, except that if authorized in the articles or bylaws, a patron member may be entitled to additional votes based on patronage criteria as described in section 351.1120. On any matter of the cooperative, an affirmative vote of all patron members entitled to vote on such matter, unless a greater or lesser amount is required by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, the bylaws, or the articles, shall be binding on all patron members. A nonpatron member has the voting rights in accordance with his or her nonpatron membership interest as granted in the articles or bylaws, subject to the provisions of sections 351.1000 to 351.1228.\n\n2. Unless otherwise set forth in the articles or bylaws, a member's vote at a members' meeting shall be in person, by mail, if a mail vote is authorized by the board, by alternative ballot if authorized by the board, or by proxy as set forth in subsection 3 of this section.\n\n3. Unless otherwise set forth in the articles or bylaws:\n\n(1) All proxies shall be in writing and executed by the member issuing such proxy, or such member's attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the chairman of the board before or at the time of a meeting in order to be effective at that meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. No appointment is irrevocable unless the appointment is coupled with an interest in the membership interests of the cooperative;\n\n(2) A copy, facsimile, or other reproduction of the original written proxy may be substituted or used in lieu of the original written proxy for any purpose for which the original written proxy could be used, if the copy, facsimile, or other reproduction is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original written proxy;\n\n(3) An appointment of a proxy for membership interests owned jointly by two or more members is valid if signed by any one of those members, unless the cooperative receives from any one of those members written notice either denying the authority of that person to appoint a proxy or appointing a different proxy, in which case the proxy will be deemed invalid. If the cooperative shall receive conflicting proxies signed by the different owners of the membership interests, then all proxies submitted for such membership interests will be deemed invalid;\n\n(4) An appointment may be terminated at will unless the appointment is coupled with an interest, in which case it shall not be terminated except in accordance with the terms of an agreement, if any, between the parties to the appointment. Termination may be made by filing written notice of the termination of the appointment with the cooperative or by filing a new written appointment of a proxy with the cooperative. Termination in either manner revokes all prior proxy appointments and is effective when filed with the cooperative.\n\n4. (1) A cooperative may provide in the articles or bylaws that units, districts, or other type of classification authorized under sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 of members are entitled to be represented at members' meetings by delegates chosen by the members of such unit, district, or other classification. The delegates may vote on matters at the members' meeting in the same manner as a member. The delegates may only exercise the voting rights on a basis and with the number of votes as prescribed in the articles or bylaws.\n\n(2) If the approval of a certain portion of the members is required for adoption of amendments, a dissolution, a merger, a consolidation, or a sale of assets, the votes of delegates shall be counted as votes by the members represented by the delegate.\n\n5. The board may fix a record date not more than sixty days, or a shorter time period as provided in the articles or bylaws, before the date of a members' meeting as the date for the determination of the owners of membership interests entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at a meeting. When a record date is so fixed, only members on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that members' meeting.\n\n6. The articles or bylaws may give or prescribe the manner of giving a creditor, security holder, or other nonmember, other than a vote by proxy under subsection 3 of this section or as otherwise allowed under section 351.1123, governance rights in the cooperative. If not otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws or by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, creditors, security holders, or other nonmembers shall not have any governance rights in the cooperative.\n\n7. Membership interests owned by two or more persons may be voted by any one of such persons unless the cooperative receives written notice from any one of such persons denying the authority of the other person or persons to vote those membership interests, in which case any vote of such membership interests shall be deemed invalid. Jointly owned membership interests shall have one vote, regardless of the number of owners, unless otherwise provided under subsection 1 of this section, the articles, or the bylaws. If the cooperative receives conflicting votes for the same membership interests, then all votes cast by such membership interests will be deemed invalid.\n\n8. Except as provided in subsection 7 of this section, an owner of a nonpatron membership interest or a patron membership interest with more than one vote may vote any portion of the membership interest in any way the member chooses, provided that such member is entitled to vote on the particular matter at issue. If a member votes without designating the proportion voted in a particular way, the member is considered to have voted all of the membership interest in that way.\n\n9. Any ballot, vote, authorization, or consent submitted by electronic communication under sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 may be revoked by the member submitting a written revocation including another ballot, vote, authorization, or consent so long as the revocation is received by a director or an officer of the cooperative which has been designated, under the bylaws or by resolution of the board, to receive such revocation at or before the meeting or before an action without a meeting is effective. A ballot, vote, authorization, or consent submitted by a member who attends a members' meeting shall automatically and without further action revoke such member's previous electronic ballot, vote, authorization, or consent, if any.\n\n(L. 2011 S.B. 366)",

A restriction on the transfer of membership interests of a cooperative may be imposed in the articles, bylaws, by a resolution adopted by the members, or by an agreement among or other written action by a number of members or holders of other membership interests or among them and the cooperative. A restriction is not binding with respect to membership interests issued prior to the adoption of the restriction, unless the holders of those membership interests are parties to the agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.\n\n2. The articles or bylaws may, but shall not be required to, provide that the cooperative or the patron members, individually or collectively, have the first right of purchasing the membership interests of any membership interests, or class thereof, offered for sale upon the terms and conditions as set forth in the articles or bylaws. A repurchase of the membership interests by the cooperative shall render such membership interests null and void.\n\n3. Except as provided in subsection 4 of this section or as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a member's financial rights are transferable in whole or in part. Such an assignment does not dissolve the cooperative and does not entitle or empower the assignee to become a member, to exercise any governance rights, to receive any notices from the cooperative, or to cause dissolution of the cooperative.\n\n4. A restriction on the assignment of financial rights may be imposed in the articles or bylaws, by a resolution adopted by the board, by a resolution adopted by the members, by an agreement among or other written action by the members, or by an agreement among or other written action by the members and the cooperative. A restriction is not binding with respect to financial rights reflected in the required records before the adoption of the restriction, unless the owners of those financial rights are parties to the agreement or voted in favor of the restriction. Once a restriction is imposed under this subsection, such restriction cannot be amended or removed by the members unless by an affirmative two-thirds majority vote of the members at an annual or special members' meeting.\n\n5. On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member, the court may charge a member's or an assignee's financial rights with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of a member's financial rights under this section. Sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 shall not deprive any member or assignee of financial rights of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the membership interest.

Subject to section 351.1123, if a member is a business entity, trust, or other entity and is dissolved, terminated, or placed by a court in receivership or bankruptcy, the powers of that member may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.

A court may grant equitable relief that it deems just and reasonable in the circumstances or may dissolve a cooperative and liquidate its assets and business:\n\n(1) In a supervised voluntary dissolution that is applied for by the cooperative;\n\n(2) In an action by a majority of the members when it is established that:\n\n(a) The directors or the persons having the authority otherwise vested in the board are deadlocked in the management of the cooperative's affairs and the members are unable to break the deadlock;\n\n(b) The board or those in control of the cooperative have breached their fiduciary duties to the members;\n\n(c) The members are so divided in voting power that, for a period that includes the time when two consecutive regular members' meetings were held, they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon the election and qualification of their successors;\n\n(d) The cooperative assets are being misapplied or wasted; or\n\n(e) The period of duration as provided in the articles has expired and has not been extended as provided in sections 351.1000 to 351.1228; and\n\n(3) In an action by a creditor when:\n\n(a) The cooperative has admitted in writing that the claim of the creditor against the cooperative is due and owing and it is established that the cooperative is unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business; or\n\n(b) In an action by the attorney general to dissolve the cooperative in accordance with sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 when it is established that a decree of dissolution is appropriate.\n\n2. In determining whether to order equitable relief or dissolution, the court shall take into consideration the financial condition of the cooperative but shall not refuse to order equitable relief or dissolution solely on the grounds that the cooperative has accumulated operating net income or current operating net income.\n\n3. In deciding whether to order dissolution of the cooperative, the court shall consider whether lesser relief suggested by one or more parties, such as a form of equitable relief or a partial liquidation, would be adequate to permanently relieve the circumstances established under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this section. Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n4. If the court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily, or otherwise not in good faith, the court may in its discretion award reasonable expenses including attorney fees and disbursements to any of the other parties.\n\n5.

(1) Subject to the constitution of this state, the laws of the jurisdiction under which a foreign cooperative is organized govern its organization and internal affairs and the liability of its members. A foreign cooperative shall not be denied a certificate of authority to transact business in this state by reason of any difference between those laws and the laws of this state.\n\n(2) A foreign cooperative holding a valid certificate of authority in this state has no greater rights or privileges than a domestic cooperative. The certificate of authority does not authorize the foreign cooperative to exercise any of its powers or purposes that a domestic cooperative is forbidden by law to exercise in this state.\n\n(3) A foreign cooperative may apply for a certificate of authority under any name that would be available to a cooperative, whether or not the name is the name under which it is authorized in its jurisdiction of organization.\n\n(4) Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to require a foreign business entity which is not formed as a cooperative association under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction but is otherwise operating on a cooperative basis to comply with the provisions of sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, including but not limited to obtaining a certificate of authority as set forth in subsection 2 of this section. Such an entity shall, however, remain obligated to comply with the revised statutes of Missouri, as applicable to such entity.\n\n2. (1) Before transacting business in this state, a foreign cooperative shall obtain a certificate of authority from the secretary of state. An applicant for the certificate shall submit to the secretary of state an application for registration as a foreign cooperative, signed by an authorized person and setting forth:\n\n(a) The name of the foreign cooperative and, if different, the name under which it proposes to register and transact business in this state;\n\n(b) The jurisdiction of its organization or formation, and the date of such organization or formation;\n\n(c) The name and business address, which may not be a post office box, of the proposed registered agent in this state, which agent shall be an individual resident of this state, a domestic business entity, or a foreign cooperative having a place of business in, and authorized to do business in, this state;\n\n(d) The address of the registered office required to be maintained in the jurisdiction of its organization by the laws of that jurisdiction or, if not so required, of the principal place of business of the foreign cooperative;\n\n(e) The date the foreign cooperative expires in the jurisdiction of its organization; and\n\n(f) A statement that the secretary of state is appointed as the agent of the foreign cooperative for service of process if the foreign cooperative fails to maintain a registered agent in this state or if the agent cannot be found or served with the exercise of reasonable diligence.\n\n(2) The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee of one hundred dollars.\n\n(3) The application shall also be accompanied by a certificate of good standing or certificate of existence issued by the secretary of state of the foreign cooperative's state of domicile, which certificate shall be dated within sixty days of the date of filing.\n\n(4) If the secretary of state finds that an application for a certificate of authority conforms to law and all fees have been paid, the secretary of state shall:\n\n(a) File the original application; and\n\n(b) Return a copy of the original application to the person who filed it with a certificate of authority issued by the secretary of state.\n\n(5) A certificate of authority issued under this section is effective from the date the application is filed with the secretary of state accompanied by the payment of the requisite fees.\n\n(6) If any statement in the application for a certificate of authority by a foreign cooperative was false when made or any arrangements or other facts described have changed, making the application inaccurate in any respect, the foreign cooperative shall promptly file with the secretary of state:\n\n(a) In the case of a change in its name, a termination, or a merger, a certificate to that effect authenticated by the proper officer of the state or country under the laws of which the foreign cooperative is organized; and\n\n(b) A fee for the document, which is the same as the fee for filing an amendment.\n\n3. A foreign cooperative authorized to transact business in this state shall:\n\n(1) Appoint and continuously maintain a registered agent in the same manner as provided in section 351.1027; or\n\n(2) File a report upon any change in the name or business address of its registered agent in the same manner as provided in section 351.1027.\n\n4. (1) A foreign cooperative authorized to transact business in this state may cancel its registration by filing articles of cancellation with the secretary of state, which articles of cancellation shall set forth:\n\n(a) The name of the foreign cooperative and the state or country under the laws of which it is organized;\n\n(b) That the foreign cooperative is not transacting business in this state;\n\n(c) That the foreign cooperative surrenders its authority to transact business in this state;\n\n(d) That the foreign cooperative revokes the authority of its registered agent in this state to accept service of process and consents to that service of process in any action, suit, or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising in this state out of the transaction of the foreign cooperative in this state;\n\n(e) A post office address to which a person may mail a copy of any process against the foreign cooperative; and\n\n(f) That the authority of the secretary of state to accept service of process in this state for any cause of action arising out of the transactions of the foreign cooperative in this state remains in full force and effect.\n\n(2) The filing with the secretary of state of a certificate of termination or a certificate of merger if the foreign cooperative is not the surviving organization from the proper officer of the state or country under the laws of which the foreign cooperative is organized constitutes a valid application of withdrawal and the authority of the foreign cooperative to transact business in this state shall cease upon the filing of the certificate.\n\n(3) The certificate of authority of a foreign cooperative to transact business in this state may be revoked by the secretary of state upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\n\n(a) The foreign cooperative has failed to appoint and maintain a registered agent as required by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, file a report upon any change in the name or business address of the registered agent, or file in the office of the secretary of state any amendment to its application for a certificate of authority as specified in subdivision (6) of subsection 2 of this section; or\n\n(b) A misrepresentation has been made of any material matter in any application, report, affidavit, or other document submitted by the foreign cooperative under sections 351.1000 to 351.1228.\n\n(4) No certificate of authority of a foreign cooperative shall be revoked by the secretary of state unless:\n\n(a) The secretary of state has given the foreign cooperative not less than sixty days' notice by mail addressed to its registered office in this state or, if the foreign cooperative fails to appoint and maintain a registered agent in this state, addressed to the office address in the jurisdiction of organization; and\n\n(b) During the sixty-day period, the foreign cooperative has failed to file the report of change regarding the registered agent, to file any amendment, or to correct the misrepresentation.\n\n(5) Sixty days after the mailing of the notice without the foreign cooperative taking the action set forth in paragraph (b) of subdivision (4) of this subsection, the authority of the foreign cooperative to transact business in this state shall cease. The secretary of state shall issue a certificate of revocation and shall mail the certificate to the address of the registered agent in this state or if there is none, then to the principal place of business or the registered office required to be maintained in the jurisdiction of organization of the foreign cooperative.\n\n5. (1) A foreign cooperative transacting business in this state shall not maintain any action, suit, or proceeding in any court of this state until it possesses a certificate of authority.\n\n(2) The failure of a foreign cooperative to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of any contract or act of the foreign cooperative or prevent the foreign cooperative from defending any action, suit, or proceeding in any court of this state.\n\n(3) A foreign cooperative, by transacting business in this state without a certificate of authority, appoints the secretary of state as its agent upon whom any notice, process, or demand may be served.\n\n(4) A foreign cooperative that transacts business in this state without a valid certificate of authority is liable to the state for the years or parts of years during which it transacted business in this state without the certificate in any amount equal to all fees that would have been imposed by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 upon the foreign cooperative had it duly obtained the certificate, filed all reports required by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, and paid all penalties imposed by sections 351.1000 to 351.1228. The attorney general shall bring proceedings to recover all amounts due this state under the provisions of this section.\n\n(5) A foreign cooperative that transacts business in this state without a valid certificate of authority shall be subject to a civil penalty, payable to the state, not to exceed five thousand dollars. Each director or in the absence of directors, each member or agent who authorizes, directs, or participates in the transaction of business in this state on behalf of a foreign cooperative that does not have a certificate shall be subject to a civil penalty, payable to the state, not to exceed one thousand dollars.\n\n(6) The civil penalties set forth in subdivision (5) of this subsection may be recovered in an action brought in this state by the attorney general. Upon a finding by the court that a foreign cooperative or any of its members, directors, or agents have transacted business in this state in violation of sections 351.1000 to 351.1228, the court shall issue, in addition to the imposition of a civil penalty, an injunction restraining the further transaction of the business of the foreign cooperative and the further exercise of the foreign cooperative's rights and privileges in this state. The foreign cooperative shall be enjoined from transacting business in this state until all civil penalties plus any interest and court costs that the court may assess have been paid and until the foreign cooperative has otherwise complied with the provisions of sections 351.1000 to 351.1228.\n\n(7) A member of a foreign cooperative shall not be liable for the debts and obligations of the foreign cooperative solely by reason of foreign cooperative's having transacted business in this state without a valid certificate of authority.\n\n6. (1) The following activities of a foreign cooperative, among others, shall not constitute transacting business within the meaning of this section:\n\n(a) Maintaining or defending any action or suit or any administrative arbitration proceeding, or settling any proceeding, claim, or dispute;\n\n(b) Holding meetings of its members or carrying on any other activities concerning its internal affairs;\n\n(c) Maintaining bank accounts;\n\n(d) Having members that are residents of this state or such members having retail locations in this state;\n\n(e) Selling through independent contractors;\n\n(f) Soliciting or obtaining orders, whether by mail or through employees or agents or otherwise, if the orders require acceptance outside this state before they become contracts;\n\n(g) Creating or acquiring indebtedness, mortgages, and security interests in real or personal property;\n\n(h) Securing or collecting debts or enforcing mortgages and security interests in property securing the debts;\n\n(i) Selling or transferring title to property in this state to any person; or\n\n(j) Conducting an isolated transaction that is completed within thirty days and that is not one in the course of repeated transactions of a like manner.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, any foreign cooperative that owns income-producing real or tangible personal property in this state, other than property exempted under subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall be considered to be transacting business in this state.\n\n(3) The list of activities in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be exhaustive. This subsection shall not apply in determining the contracts or activities that may subject a foreign cooperative to service of process or taxation in this state or to regulation under any other law of this state.\n\n7. The secretary of state, the attorney general, or both, may bring an action to restrain a foreign cooperative from transacting business in this state in violation of sections 351.1000 to 351.1228 or other laws of this state.\n\n8. Service of process on a foreign cooperative shall be as provided under Missouri law.\n\n(L. 2011 S.B. 366)",
