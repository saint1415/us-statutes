All facts obtained in the examination of the books and records of any limited liability company, or through the voluntary sworn statement of any manager, member, agent or employee of any limited liability company, shall be treated as confidential, except insofar as official duty may require the disclosure of same, or when such facts are material to any issue in any legal proceeding in which the secretary or his designated employee may be a party or called as witness, and, if the secretary or his designated employee shall, except as provided in this subdivision, disclose any information relative to the private accounts, affairs, and transactions of any such limited liability company, he shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor. If any manager, member or registered agent in possession or control of such books and records of any such limited liability company shall refuse a demand of the secretary or his designated employee, to exhibit the books and records of such limited liability company for examination, such person shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor;\n\n(2) The power to cancel or disapprove any articles of organization or other filing required under sections 347.010 to 347.187, if the limited liability company fails to comply with the provisions of sections 347.010 to 347.187 by failing to file required documents under sections 347.010 to 347.187, by failing to maintain a registered agent, by failing to pay the required filing fees, by using fraud or deception in effecting any filing, by filing a required document containing a false statement, or by violating any section or sections of the criminal laws of Missouri, the federal government or any other state of the United States. Thirty days before such cancellation shall take effect, the secretary shall notify the limited liability company with written notice, either personally or by certified mail, deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to such limited liability company's last registered agent in office, or to one of the limited liability company's members or managers. Written notice of the secretary's proposed cancellation to the limited liability company, domestic or foreign, shall specify the reasons for such action. The limited liability company may appeal this notice of proposed cancellation to the circuit court of the county in which the registered office of such limited liability company is or is proposed to be situated by filing with the clerk of such court a petition setting forth a copy of the articles of organization or other relevant documents and a copy of the proposed written cancellation thereof by the secretary, such petition to be filed within thirty days after notice of such cancellation shall have been given, and the matter shall be tried by the court, and the court shall either sustain the action of the secretary or direct him to take such action as the court may deem proper. An appeal from the circuit court in such a case shall be allowed as in civil action.

If mailed, the notice shall be deemed delivered five days after it is deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope addressed to such limited liability company's last registered agent and office or to one of the limited liability company's managers or members.\n\n(c) If the limited liability company does not timely file an articles of amendment in accordance with section 347.041 to extend the duration of the limited liability company, which may be any number of years or perpetual, or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary that the period of duration determined by the secretary is incorrect, within sixty days after service of the notice is perfected by posting with the United States Postal Service, then the secretary shall cancel the articles of organization by signing an administrative cancellation that recites the grounds for cancellation and its effective date. The secretary shall file the original of the administrative cancellation and serve a copy on the limited liability company as provided in section 347.051.\n\n(d) A limited liability company whose articles of organization has been administratively cancelled continues its existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 347.147 and notify claimants under section 347.141.\n\n(e) The administrative cancellation of an articles of organization does not terminate the authority of its registered agent.\n\n(6) (a) The power to rescind an administrative cancellation and reinstate the articles of organization.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a limited liability company whose articles of organization has been administratively cancelled under subdivision (5) of this section may file an articles of amendment in accordance with section 347.041 to extend the duration of the limited liability company, which may be any number or perpetual.\n\n(c) A limited liability company whose articles of organization has been administratively cancelled under subdivision (5) of this section may apply to the secretary for reinstatement. The applicant shall:\n\na. Recite the name of the limited liability company and the effective date of its administrative cancellation;\n\nb.

Be accompanied by a reinstatement fee in the amount of one hundred dollars, or such greater amount as required by state regulation, plus any delinquent fees, penalties, and other charges as determined by the secretary to then be due.\n\n(d) If the secretary determines that the application contains the information and is accompanied by the fees required in paragraph (c) of this subdivision and that the information and fees are correct, the secretary shall rescind the cancellation and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his or her determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original articles of organization, and serve a copy on the limited liability company as provided in section 347.051.\n\n(e) When the reinstatement is effective, it shall relate back to and take effect as of the effective date of the administrative cancellation of the articles of organization and the limited liability company may continue carrying on its business as if the administrative cancellation had never occurred.\n\n(f) In the event the name of the limited liability company was reissued by the secretary to another entity prior to the time application for reinstatement was filed, the limited liability company applying for reinstatement may elect to reinstate using a new name that complies with the requirements of section 347.020 and that has been approved by appropriate action of the limited liability company for changing the name thereof.\n\n(g) If the secretary denies a limited liability company's application for reinstatement following administrative cancellation of the articles of organization, he or she shall serve the limited liability company as provided in section 347.051 with a written notice that explains the reason or reasons for denial.\n\n(h) The limited liability company may appeal a denial of reinstatement as provided for in subdivision (2) of this section.\n\n(7) Subdivision (6) of this section shall apply to any limited liability company whose articles of organization was cancelled because such limited liability company's period of duration stated in the articles of organization expired on or after August 28, 2003.\n\n(L. 1993 S.B. 66 & 20 § 359.828, A.L. 2009 H.B. 481 merged with S.B. 217)",

Each series with limited liability may, in its own name, contract, hold title to assets, grant security interests, sue and be sued, and otherwise conduct business and exercise the powers of a limited liability company under this chapter. The limited liability company and any of its series may elect to consolidate its operations as a single taxpayer to the extent permitted under applicable law, elect to work cooperatively, elect to contract jointly, or elect to be treated as a single business for the purposes of qualification or authorization to do business in this or any other state. Such elections shall not affect the limitation of liability set forth in this section except to the extent that the series have specifically accepted joint liability by contract.\n\n3. Except in the case of a foreign limited liability company that has adopted a name that is not the name under which it is registered in its jurisdiction of organization, as permitted under sections 347.153 and 347.157, the name of the series with limited liability is required to contain the entire name of the limited liability company and be distinguishable from the names of the other series set forth in the articles of organization. In the case of a foreign limited liability company that has adopted a name that is not the name under which it is registered in its jurisdiction of organization, as permitted under sections 347.153 and 347.157, the name of the series with limited liability must contain the entire name under which the foreign limited liability company has been admitted to transact business in this state.\n\n4.

If not the same as the limited liability company, the names of the members of a member-managed series or of the managers of a manager-managed series may be changed by an amendment to the articles of organization with the secretary of state.\n\n(d) A series with limited liability under this section may be dissolved by filing with the secretary of state articles of amendment pursuant to section 347.041 identifying the series being dissolved or by the dissolution of the limited liability company as provided in section 347.045. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the limited liability company. The dissolution of a series established in accordance with subsection 2 of this section shall not affect the limitation on liabilities of such series provided by subsection 2 of this section. A series is terminated and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of the limited liability company under section 347.045.\n\n(e) Articles of organization, amendment, or termination described under this subdivision may be executed by the limited liability company or any manager, person, or entity designated in the operating agreement for the limited liability company.\n\n(2) If different from the limited liability company, the articles of organization shall list the names of the members for each series if the series is member-managed or the names of the managers if the series is manager-managed.\n\n(3) A series of a limited liability company shall be deemed to be in good standing as long as the limited liability company is in good standing.\n\n(4) The registered agent and registered office for the limited liability company appointed under section 347.033 shall serve as the agent and office for service of process for each series in this state.\n\n5. (1) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights, powers, and duties as an operating agreement may provide and may make provision for the future creation of additional classes or groups of members or managers associated with the series having such relative rights, powers, and duties as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers, and duties senior and subordinate to or different from existing classes and groups of members or managers associated with the series.\n\n(2) A series may be managed either by the member or members associated with the series or by the manager or managers chosen by the members of such series, as provided in the operating agreement. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with such series.\n\n(3) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified members or managers, or to a specified class or group of the members or managers associated with a series, the right to vote separately or with all or any class or group of the members or managers associated with the series, on any matter. An operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of members associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series, but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the series.\n\n(4) Except as modified in this section, the provisions of this chapter which are generally applicable to limited liability companies and their managers, members, and transferees shall be applicable to each particular series with respect to the operation of such series.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event specified in this chapter or in an operating agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a manager with respect to a series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to cease to be a manager of the limited liability company or with respect to any other series thereof.\n\n(6) Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event specified in this chapter or in an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to be associated with any other series, terminate the continued membership of a member in the limited liability company, or cause the termination of the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining member associated with such series.\n\n(7) An operating agreement may impose restrictions, duties, and obligations on members of the limited liability company or any series thereof as a matter of internal governance, including, without limitation, those with regard to:\n\n(a) Choice of law, forum selection, or consent to personal jurisdiction;\n\n(b) Capital contributions;\n\n(c) Restrictions on, or terms and conditions of, the transfer of membership interests;\n\n(d) Restrictive covenants, including noncompetition, nonsolicitation, and confidentiality provisions;\n\n(e) Fiduciary duties; and\n\n(f) Restrictions, duties, or obligations to or for the benefit of the limited liability company, other series thereof, or their affiliates.\n\n6. (1) If a limited liability company with the ability to establish series does not register to do business in a foreign jurisdiction for itself and its series, a series of a limited liability company may itself register to do business as a limited liability company in the foreign jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.\n\n(2) If a foreign limited liability company, as permitted in the jurisdiction of its organization, has established a series having separate rights, powers, or duties and has limited the liabilities of such series so that the debts, liabilities, and obligations incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, or so that the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof are not enforceable against the assets of such series, then the limited liability company, on behalf of itself or any of its series, or any of its series on its own behalf may register to do business in this state in accordance with this chapter. The limitation of liability shall also be stated on the application for registration. As required under section 347.153, the registration application filed shall identify each series being registered to do business in the state by the limited liability company. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, the debts, liabilities, and obligations incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series of such a foreign limited liability company shall be enforceable against the assets of such series only and not against the assets of the foreign limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing with respect to such a foreign limited liability company generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.\n\n7. Nothing in sections 347.039, 347.153, or 347.186 shall be construed to alter existing Missouri statute or common law providing any cause of action for fraudulent conveyance, including but not limited to chapter 428, or any relief available under existing law that permits a challenge to limited liability.\n\n(L. 2013 H.B. 510)\n\n*Words \"subparagraphs (e) and (f) of paragraph (1) of subdivision 1\" appear in original rolls.",
