When a death occurs outside a licensed health care facility, the first licensed medical professional or law enforcement official learning of such death shall immediately contact the county coroner. Immediately upon receipt of such notification, the coroner or the coroner's deputy shall make the determination if further investigation is necessary, based on information provided by the individual contacting the coroner, and immediately advise such individual of the coroner's intentions.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2 of this section to the contrary, when a death occurs under the care of a hospice, no investigation shall be required if the death is certified by the treating physician of the deceased or the medical director of the hospice as a natural death due to disease or diagnosed illness. The hospice shall provide written notice to the coroner within twenty-four hours of the death.\n\n4. Upon taking charge of the dead body and before moving the body the coroner shall notify the police department of any city in which the dead body is found, or if the dead body is found in the unincorporated area of a county governed by the provisions of sections 58.451 to 58.457, the coroner shall notify the county sheriff or the highway patrol and cause the body to remain unmoved until the police department, sheriff or the highway patrol has inspected the body and the surrounding circumstances and carefully noted the appearance, the condition and position of the body and recorded every fact and circumstance tending to show the cause and manner of death, with the names and addresses of all known witnesses, and shall subscribe the same and make such record a part of the coroner's report.\n\n5. In any case of sudden, violent or suspicious death after which the body was buried without any investigation or autopsy, the coroner, upon being advised of such facts, may at the coroner's own discretion request that the prosecuting attorney apply for a court order requiring the body to be exhumed.\n\n6. The coroner may certify the cause of death in any case where death occurred without medical attendance or where an attending physician refuses to sign a certificate of death or when a physician is unavailable to sign a certificate of death.\n\n7. When the cause of death is established by the coroner, the coroner shall file a copy of the findings in the coroner's office within thirty days.\n\n8. If on view of the dead body and after personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death, the coroner determines that a further examination is necessary in the public interest, the coroner on the coroner's own authority may make or cause to be made an autopsy on the body. The coroner may on the coroner's own authority employ the services of a pathologist, chemist, or other expert to aid in the examination of the body or of substances supposed to have caused or contributed to death, and if the pathologist, chemist, or other expert is not already employed by the city or county for the discharge of such services, the pathologist, chemist, or other expert shall, upon written authorization of the coroner, be allowed reasonable compensation, payable by the city or county, in the manner provided in section 58.530. The coroner shall, at the time of the autopsy, record or cause to be recorded each fact and circumstance tending to show the condition of the body and the cause and manner of death.\n\n9. If on view of the dead body and after personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death, the coroner considers a further inquiry and examination necessary in the public interest, the coroner shall make out the coroner's warrant directed to the sheriff of the city or county requiring the sheriff forthwith to summon six good and lawful citizens of the county to appear before the coroner, at the time and place expressed in the warrant, and to inquire how and by whom the deceased died.\n\n10. (1) When a person is being transferred from one county to another county for medical treatment and such person dies while being transferred, or dies while being treated in the emergency room of the receiving facility the place which the person is determined to be dead shall be considered the place of death and the county coroner or medical examiner of the county from which the person was originally being transferred shall be responsible for determining the cause and manner of death for the Missouri certificate of death.\n\n(2) The coroner or medical examiner in the county in which the person is determined to be dead may with authorization of the coroner or medical examiner from the original transferring county, investigate and conduct postmortem examinations at the expense of the coroner or medical examiner from the original transferring county. The coroner or medical examiner from the original transferring county shall be responsible for investigating the circumstances of such and completing the Missouri certificate of death. The certificate of death shall be filed in the county where the deceased was pronounced dead.\n\n(3) Such coroner or medical examiner of the county where a person is determined to be dead shall immediately notify the coroner or medical examiner of the county from which the person was originally being transferred of the death of such person, and shall make available information and records obtained for investigation of the death.\n\n(4) If a person does not die while being transferred and is institutionalized as a regularly admitted patient after such transfer and subsequently dies while in such institution, the coroner or medical examiner of the county in which the person is determined to be dead shall immediately notify the coroner or medical examiner of the county from which such person was originally transferred of the death of such person. In such cases, the county in which the deceased was institutionalized shall be considered the place of death. If the manner of death is by homicide, suicide, accident, criminal abortion including those that are self-induced, child fatality, or any unusual or suspicious manner, the investigation of the cause and manner of death shall revert to the county of origin, and this coroner or medical examiner shall be responsible for the Missouri certificate of death. The certificate of death shall be filed in the county where the deceased was pronounced dead.\n\n11. There shall not be any statute of limitations or time limits on the cause of death when death is the final result or determined to be caused by homicide, suicide, accident, child fatality, criminal abortion including those self-induced, or any unusual or suspicious manner. The place of death shall be the place in which the person is determined to be dead. The final investigation of death in determining the cause and matter of death shall revert to the county of origin, and the coroner or medical examiner of such county shall be responsible for the Missouri certificate of death. The certificate of death shall be filed in the county where the deceased was pronounced dead.\n\n12. Except as provided in subsection 10 of this section, if a person dies in one county and the body is subsequently transferred to another county, for burial or other reasons, the county coroner or medical examiner where the death occurred shall be responsible for the certificate of death and for investigating the cause and manner of the death.\n\n13.

When any person, in any county in which a coroner is required by section 58.010, dies and there are reasonable grounds to believe that such person was less than eighteen years of age, who is eligible to receive a certificate of live birth, the police, sheriff, law enforcement officer or official, health practitioner or hospital or any person having knowledge of such a death shall immediately notify the coroner of the known facts concerning the time, place, manner and circumstances of the death. The coroner shall notify the division of the child's death pursuant to section 210.115. The coroner shall immediately evaluate the necessity for child fatality review and shall immediately notify the chairman of the child fatality review panel. The child fatality review panel shall be activated within twenty-four hours of such notice to review any death which includes one or more of the suspicious circumstances described in the protocol developed by the department of social services, state technical assistance team pursuant to section 210.194.\n\n2. If the coroner determines that the death of the person under age eighteen years, who is eligible to receive a certificate of live birth, does not include any suspicious circumstances listed in the protocol, the coroner shall complete a nonsuspicious child death form provided by the department of social services, state technical assistance team and have the form cosigned by the chairman of the child fatality review panel and forward the original to the department of social services, state technical assistance team within forty-eight hours of receiving notice of the child's death.\n\n3. When a child under the age of eighteen years, who is eligible to receive a certificate of live birth dies, the coroner shall notify a certified child death pathologist to determine the need for an autopsy. The certified child death pathologist, in conjunction with the coroner, shall determine the need for an autopsy. If there is disagreement concerning the need for the autopsy, the certified child death pathologist shall make the determination unless the child fatality review panel, within twelve hours, decides against the certified child death pathologist.\n\n4. When there is a disagreement regarding the necessity for an autopsy, the certified child death pathologist shall file a report with the chairman of the child fatality review panel indicating the basis for the disagreement. The pathologist's report on the disagreement shall be included in the report to the department of social services, state technical assistance team.

Release of decedent information to procurement organizations, when — medicolegal examination permitted — recovery of body parts, requirements. —1. Upon request of a procurement organization, a coroner or medical examiner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner. If the decedent's body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, the coroner or medical examiner shall release postmortem examination results to the procurement organization. The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of the postmortem examination results or other information received from the coroner or medical examiner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.\n\n2. The coroner or medical examiner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all medical records, laboratory test results, x-rays, other diagnostic results, and other information that any person possesses about a prospective donor or a donor whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner which the coroner or medical examiner determines may be relevant to the investigation.\n\n3. A person that has any information requested by a coroner or medical examiner under subsection 2 of this section shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the coroner or medical examiner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of parts for purposes of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.\n\n4. If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner and a postmortem examination is not required, or the coroner or medical examiner determines that a postmortem examination is required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with the examination, the coroner or medical examiner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for purposes of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.\n\n5. If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner has been or might be made, but the coroner or medical examiner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the postmortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death, the coroner or medical examiner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery. After consultation, the coroner or medical examiner may allow recovery.\n\n6. Following the consultation under subsection 5 of this section, in the absence of mutually agreed upon protocols to resolve conflict between the coroner or medical examiner and the procurement organization, if the coroner or medical examiner intends to deny recovery, the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee, at the request of the procurement organization, shall attend the removal procedure for the part before making a final determination not to allow the procurement organization to recover the part. During the removal procedure, the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee may allow recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.\n\n7. If the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee denies recovery under subsection 6 of this section, the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee shall:\n\n(1) Explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part;\n\n(2) Include the specific reasons in the records of the coroner or medical examiner; and\n\n(3) Provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.\n\n8. If the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee allows recovery of a part under subsection 4, 5, or 6 of this section, the procurement organization shall, upon request, cause the physician or technician who removes the part to provide the coroner or medical examiner with a record describing the condition of the part, a biopsy, photograph, and any other information and observations that would assist in the postmortem examination.\n\n9. If a coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee is required to be present at a removal procedure under subsection 6 of this section, the procurement organization requesting the recovery of the part shall, upon request, reimburse the coroner or medical examiner or his or her designee for the additional costs incurred in complying with subsection 6 of this section.\n\n(L. 2008 S.B. 1139)",

If a coroner or medical examiner receives notice from a procurement organization that an anatomical gift might be available or was made with respect to a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner and a postmortem examination is going to be performed, unless the coroner or medical examiner denies recovery in accordance with section 58.785, the coroner or medical examiner or designee shall conduct a postmortem examination of the body or the part in a manner and within a time period compatible with its preservation for the purposes of the gift.\n\n3. A part may not be removed from the body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of a coroner or medical examiner for transplantation, therapy, research, or education unless the part is the subject of an anatomical gift. The body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner may not be delivered to a person for research or education unless the body is the subject of an anatomical gift. This subsection does not preclude a coroner or medical examiner from performing the medicolegal investigation upon the body or parts of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner.\n\n(L. 2008 S.B. 1139)",
