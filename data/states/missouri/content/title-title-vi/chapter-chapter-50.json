The clerk or court administrator of the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which such county is located shall set a date, time and place for the salary commission meeting and serve as temporary chairman of the salary commission until the members of the commission elect a chairman from their number. Upon written request of a majority of the salary commission members the clerk or court administrator of the circuit court shall forthwith set the earliest date possible for a meeting of the salary commission. The circuit clerk or court administrator shall give notice of the time and place of any meeting of the salary commission. Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in such county at least five days prior to such meeting. Such notice shall contain a general description of the business to be discussed at such meeting.\n\n3.

A majority of members shall constitute a quorum.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 610.021 and 610.022, all meetings of a county salary commission shall be open meetings and all votes taken at such meetings shall be open records. Any vote taken at any meeting of the salary commission shall be taken by recorded yeas and nays.\n\n5. In every county, the salary commission shall meet at least once before November thirtieth of each odd-numbered year and may meet in any even-numbered year. The salary commission may meet as many times as it deems necessary and may meet after November thirtieth and prior to December fifteenth of any odd-numbered year if the commission has met at least once prior to November thirtieth of that year. At any meeting of the salary commission, the members shall elect a chairman from their number. The county clerk shall present a report on the financial condition of the county to the commission once the chairman is elected, and shall keep the minutes of the meeting.\n\n6. For purposes of this section, the 1988 base compensation is the compensation paid on September 1, 1987, plus the same percentage increase paid or allowed, whichever is greater, to the presiding commissioner or the sheriff, whichever is greater, of that county for the year beginning January 1, 1988. Such increase shall be expressed as a percentage of the difference between the maximum allowable compensation and the compensation paid on September 1, 1987. At its meeting in 1987 and at any meeting held in 1988, the salary commission shall determine the compensation to be paid to every county officer holding office on January 1, 1988. The salary commission shall establish the compensation for each office at an amount not greater than that set by law as the maximum compensation. If the salary commission votes to increase compensation, but not to pay the maximum amount authorized by law for any officer or office, then the increase in compensation shall be the same percentage increase for all officers and offices and shall be expressed as a percentage of the difference between the maximum allowable compensation and the compensation being received at the time of the vote. If two-thirds of the members of the salary commission vote to decrease the compensation being received at the time of the vote below that compensation, all officers shall receive the same percentage decrease. The commission may vote not to increase or decrease the compensation and that compensation shall continue to be the salary of such offices and officers during the subsequent term of office.\n\n7. For the year 1989 and every second year thereafter, the salary commission shall meet in every county as many times as it deems necessary on or prior to November thirtieth of any such year for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be paid to county officials. For each year in which the commission meets, the members shall elect a chairman from their number. The county clerk shall present a report on the financial condition of the county to the commission once the chairman is elected, and shall keep minutes of the meeting. The salary commission shall then consider the compensation to be paid for the next term of office for each county officer to be elected at their next general election. If the commission votes not to increase or decrease the compensation, the salary being paid during the term in which the vote was taken shall continue as the salary of such offices and officers during the subsequent term of office. If the salary commission votes to increase the compensation, all officers or offices whose compensation is being considered by the commission at that time shall receive the same percentage of the maximum allowable compensation. However, for any county in which all offices' and officers' salaries have been set at one hundred percent of the maximum allowable compensation, the commission may vote to increase the compensation of all offices except that of full-time prosecuting attorneys at that or any subsequent meeting of the salary commission without regard to any law or maximum limitation established by law. Such increase shall be expressed as a percentage of the compensation being paid during the term of office when the vote is taken, and each officer or office whose compensation is being established by the salary commission at that time shall receive the same percentage increase over the compensation being paid for that office during the term when the vote is taken. This increase shall be in addition to any increase mandated by an official's salary schedule because of changes in assessed valuation during the current term. If the salary commission votes to decrease the compensation, a vote of two-thirds or more of all the members of the salary commission shall be required before the salary or other compensation of any county office shall be decreased below the compensation being paid for the particular office on the date the salary commission votes, and all officers and offices shall receive the same percentage decrease.\n\n8. The salary commission shall issue, not later than December fifteenth of any year in which it meets, a report of compensation to be paid to each officer and the compensation so set shall be paid beginning with the start of the subsequent term of office of each officer. The report of compensation shall be certified to the clerk of the county commission for the county and shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nThe salary commission for _________ County hereby certifies that it has met pursuant to law to establish compensation for county officers to be paid to such officers during the next term of office for the officers affected. The salary commission reports that there shall be (no increase in compensation) (an increase of _________ percent) (a decrease of _________ percent) (county officer's salaries set at _________ percent of the maximum allowable compensation).\n\n­­Salaries shall be adjusted each year on the official's year of incumbency for any change in the last completed assessment that would affect the maximum allowable compensation for that office.\n\n9. For the meeting in 1989 and every meeting thereafter, in the event a salary commission in any county fails, neglects or refuses to meet as provided in this section, or in the event a majority of the salary commission is unable to reach an agreement and so reports or fails to certify a salary report to the clerk of the county commission by December fifteenth of any year in which a report is required to be certified by this section, then the compensation being paid to each affected office or officer on such date shall continue to be the compensation paid to the affected office or officer during the succeeding term of office.\n\n10. Other provisions of law notwithstanding, in every instance where an officer or employee of any county is paid a mileage allowance or reimbursement, the county commission shall allow or reimburse such officers or employees out of the county treasury at the highest rate paid to any county officer for each mile actually and necessarily traveled in the performance of their official duties. The county commission of any county may elect to pay a mileage allowance for any county commissioner for travel going to and returning from the place of holding commission meetings and for all other necessary travel on official county business in the personal motor vehicle of the commissioner presenting the claim. The governing body of any county of the first classification not having a charter form of government may provide by order for the payment of mileage expenses of elected and appointed county officials by payment of a certain amount monthly which would reflect the average monthly mileage expenses of such officer based on the amount allowed pursuant to state law for the payment of mileage for state employees. Any order entered for such purpose shall not be construed as salary, wages or other compensation for services rendered.\n\n11. The term\"maximum allowable compensation\"as used in this section means the highest compensation which may be paid to the specified officer or office in the particular county based on the salary schedule established by law for the specified officer or office. If the salary commission at its meeting in 1987 voted for one hundred percent of the maximum allowable compensation and does not change such vote at its meeting held within thirty days after May 13, 1988, as provided in subsection 6 of this section, the one hundred percent shall be calculated on the basis of the total allowable compensation permitted after May 13, 1988.\n\n12. At the salary commission meeting which establishes the percentage rate to be applied to county officers during the next term of office, the salary commission may authorize the further adjustment of such officers' compensation as a cost-of-living component and effective January first of each year, the compensation for county officers may be adjusted by the county commission, and if the adjustment of compensation is authorized, the percentage increase shall be the same for all county officers, not to exceed the percentage increase given to the other county employees. The compensation for all county officers may be set as a group, although the change in compensation will not become effective until the next term of office for each officer.\n\n13. At the salary commission meeting in 1997 which establishes the salaries for those officers to be elected at the general election in 1998, the salary commission of each noncharter county may provide salary increases for associate county commissioners elected in 1996. This one-time increase is necessitated by the change from two- to four-year terms for associate commissioners pursuant to house bill 256*, passed by the first regular session of the eighty-eighth general assembly in 1995.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 65, et al. § 7, A.L. 1988 S.B. 431, A.L. 1990 S.B. 525 merged with S.B. 580, A.L. 1995 H.B. 274 & 268, A.L. 1996 S.B. 719, A.L. 1997 S.B. 11, A.L. 1998 S.B. 819, A.L. 2005 S.B. 210, A.L. 2018 S.B. 568)\n\n*See section 49.020.\n\n(2000) In determining amount of annual compensation to be paid to public administrators, more specific provisions of section 473.739 apply.

County sheriff's revolving fund established — fees deposited into, use of moneys — no prior approval for expenditures required—authorized payment of certain expenses — excess funds, use of. —1. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 50.525 to 50.745, the fee collected pursuant to subsections 11 and 12 of section 571.101 shall be deposited by the county treasurer into a separate interest-bearing fund to be known as the \"County Sheriff's Revolving Fund\" to be expended at the direction of the county or city sheriff or his or her designee as provided in this section.\n\n2. No prior approval of the expenditures from this fund shall be required by the governing body of the county or city not within a county, nor shall any prior audit or encumbrance of the fund be required before any expenditure is made by the sheriff from this fund. This fund shall only be used by law enforcement agencies for the purchase of equipment, to provide training, and to make necessary expenditures to process applications for concealed carry permits or renewals, including but not limited to the purchase of equipment, information and data exchange, training, fingerprinting and background checks, employment of additional personnel, and any expenditure necessitated by an action under section 571.114 or 571.117. Except as provided in subsection 5 of this section, if the moneys collected and deposited into this fund are not totally expended annually, then the unexpended balance may remain in said fund and the balance may be kept in said fund to accumulate from year to year. This fund may be audited by the state auditor's office or the appropriate auditing agency. The funds received under section 571.101 shall be used only to supplement the sheriff's funding received from other county, state, or general funds. The county commission shall not reduce any sheriff's budget as a result of funds received under section 571.101.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the sheriff of every county, regardless of classification, is authorized to pay, from the sheriff's revolving fund, all reasonable and necessary costs and expenses for activities or services occasioned by compliance with sections 571.101 to 571.121. Such was the intent of the general assembly in original enactment of this section and sections 571.101 to 571.121, and it is made express by this section in light of the decision in Brooks v. State of Missouri, (Mo. Sup. Ct. February 26, 2004). The application and renewal fees to be charged pursuant to section 571.101 shall be based on the sheriff's good faith estimate, made during regular budgeting cycles, of the actual costs and expenses to be incurred by reason of compliance with sections 571.101 to 571.121. If the maximum fee permitted by section 571.101 is inadequate to cover the actual reasonable and necessary expenses in a given year, and there are not sufficient accumulated unexpended funds in the revolving fund, a sheriff may present specific and verified evidence of the unreimbursed expenses to the office of administration, which upon certification by the attorney general shall reimburse such sheriff for those expenses from an appropriation made for that purpose.\n\n4. If pursuant to subsection 13 of section 571.101, the sheriff of a county of the first classification designates one or more chiefs of police of any town, city, or municipality within such county to accept and process applications for concealed carry permits, then that sheriff shall reimburse such chiefs of police, out of the moneys deposited into this fund, for any reasonable expenses related to accepting and processing such applications.\n\n5. Any excess funds unnecessary to meet the mandate of subsection 3 of this section may be expended for other purposes or transferred to discretionary funds for county sheriffs; provided that, no claim for inadequate coverage under subsection 3 of this section has been made within the last five years resulting in reimbursement from the office of administration for expenses incurred implementing sections 571.101 to 571.121.\n\n(L. 2003 H.B. 349, et al., A.L. 2005 H.B. 365, A.L. 2011 H.B. 294, et al., A.L. 2013 S.B. 75, A.L. 2016 S.B. 656)\n\n*Effective 10-14-16, see § 21.250.

Each member who makes contributions to the deferred compensation program described in section 50.1300 during the calendar year for which the contribution is made shall be eligible to receive an allocation of this contribution. Generally, the board shall allocate matching contributions pro rata, on the basis of a member's contributions to the deferred compensation program described in section 50.1300. However, the board shall follow these rules in making this allocation:\n\n(1) Board matching contributions allocated to a member who is not a member of LAGERS shall not exceed the lesser of (i) three percent of such nonLAGERS member's compensation for the calendar year or (ii) fifty percent of such nonLAGERS member's contributions to the deferred compensation program described in section 50.1300;\n\n(2) Board matching contributions allocated to a member who is a member of LAGERS shall not exceed the lesser of (i) one and one-half percent of such member's compensation for the calendar year or (ii) twenty-five percent of such member's contributions to the deferred compensation program described in section 50.1300;\n\n(3) The board shall set a specific matching percentage for each calendar year. Unless otherwise provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the matching contribution allocated to a nonLAGERS member shall be such matching percentage, multiplied by the member's contributions to the deferred compensation program for the calendar year. Unless otherwise provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the board matching contribution allocated to a member who is also a LAGERS member shall be one-half of the matching percentage, multiplied by the member's contributions to the deferred compensation program for the calendar year.\n\n2. In addition to matching contributions made by the board pursuant to the aforementioned criteria, a county shall also be entitled to make matching contributions to defined contribution accounts of members employed by such county in accordance with the rules and regulations formulated and adopted by the board from time to time.\n\n(L. 1999 S.B. 308 & 314 merged with S.B. 467, A.L. 2001 S.B. 274)\n\nEffective 1-01-02",
