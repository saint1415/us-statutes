SHORT TITLE\n\n1.1. This compact shall be known and may be cited as the \"Kansas-Missouri Flood Prevention and Control Compact\".\n\nARTICLE II. PURPOSES\n\n2.1. It is recognized that destructive floods occur in certain rivers which affect disastrously both of the party states by upsetting orderly processes, causing loss of life and property, the erosion of lands, impairing and obstructing farming and commercial operations, navigation, highways and railroads, and constitute a common menace to the states. The prevention and control of floods in these areas are public purposes of the party states. A single agency is essential for effective and economical direction, supervision and coordination of examination of needs and planning for flood prevention and control in these common areas. For these purposes the party states do hereby establish the Kansas-Missouri Flood Prevention and Control Commission. The commission shall have jurisdiction hereunder with respect to flood prevention and control in the district comprising the following counties of Kansas and Missouri: Johnson, Wyandotte and Atchison counties in Kansas; Jackson, Clay, Platte, and Buchanan counties in Missouri.\n\nARTICLE III. ORGANIZATION OF COMMISSION\n\n3.1. The commission shall be an interstate body, both corporate and politic serving as a common agency of the party states and representing them both collectively and individually in the exercise of its powers and duties.\n\n3.2. The commission shall be composed of eleven members, one commissioner representing the appropriate federal agency having jurisdiction of flood prevention and control measures in the area, five commissioners from Kansas and five from Missouri, each of whom shall be a resident of such state, and at least three commissioners from each state shall be residents of the region subject to the jurisdiction of the commission hereunder. The commissioners from each state shall be qualified, chosen and appointed by each state in the manner provided by the laws of the respective states. The federal representative shall be appointed by the officer or officers having power to appoint him to the federal office he then holds. The representative of the federal government shall not be entitled to vote on any action of the commission but may attend and otherwise participate in commission meetings and may make recommendations to the commission. Each member shall hold office at the pleasure of the appointing authority. The commission shall elect a chairman from among its members.\n\n3.3. The commission's functions shall be performed and carried out by its members, advisory committees and panels representative of citizens and political subdivisions and other governmental agencies in the compact region as may be established by the commission, and by such officers, agents and employees as may be appointed by the commission, subject to its direction and control. All such officers, agents and employees shall hold office at the pleasure of the commission, which shall prescribe their powers, duties and qualifications and fix their compensation and other terms of their employment.\n\n3.4. A quorum of the commission for the purpose of transacting business at any commission meeting shall exist only when there are present, in person, at least three members from each of the party states. No action of the commission shall be effective or binding unless a majority of each party state's representatives who are present at the commission meeting shall vote in favor thereof. Certified copies of the minutes of each commission meeting shall be sent to each of the governors of the party states within ten days of the meeting. The vote of any one or more of the representatives from each party state may be vetoed and cancelled by the governor of such state within ten days, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays of the particular state excepted, after receipt by the governor of the certified copy of the minutes of the meeting at which such vote was cast, the intent being to empower the governor of each party state to nullify the commission's action upon which such vote had been taken.\n\n3.5. The members of the commission shall receive no compensation for their services pursuant to this compact but they shall be entitled to be paid the expenses actually and necessarily incurred by them in the performance of their duties.\n\n3.6. No member of the commission who is otherwise a public officer or employee shall suffer a forfeiture of his office or employment, or any loss or diminution in the rights and privileges appertaining thereto, by reason of such membership.\n\nARTICLE IV. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION\n\n4.1. The function of the commission shall be to act as an official comprehensive study and planning agency of the party states for the compact region. It shall conduct surveys, make studies, submit recommendations and prepare plans designed to aid in solving immediate and long-range joint problems of flood prevention and control, including but not limited to, soil and water erosion control and abatement, the building of sanitary and storm sewers in watersheds extending into the territorial limits of both the states, the constructing of levees along the banks of, or shortening or diverting or otherwise improving any natural watercourse to prevent its overflow where the same overflow is likely to cause damage to lands situated within the territorial limits of the party states, and may receive aid from, contract and cooperate with the United States, and with public and private corporations and with individuals owning or exercising jurisdiction over lands which are subject to injury by such overflow, or which may require such sewers.\n\n4.2. The commission shall also act as a liaison to encourage coordination among and between all agencies and entities, governmental and private, charged with or having a substantial interest in the planning or providing of flood prevention and control measures within any part of the compact region. In furtherance of this function, the commission shall, through advisory committees or panels, provide for the representation and participation of officials of political subdivisions and other governmental agencies in the compact region in the development of policies, plans and programs and shall report to the party states on the regional implications of any development plans or programs proposed by any such agency or entity.\n\n4.3.

If the senate is not in session at the time for making any appointment, the governor shall make a temporary appointment as in case of a vacancy. Any two of the commissioners so appointed together with the attorney general of the state of Missouri may act to enter into the following compact:\n\nCOMPACT BETWEEN MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS CREATING THE BI-STATE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE BI-STATE METROPOLITAN DISTRICT\n\nThe states of Missouri and Illinois enter into the following agreement:\n\nThey agree to and pledge each to the other faithful cooperation in the future planning and development of the bi-state metropolitan district, holding in high trust for the benefit of its people and of the nation the special blessings and natural advantages thereof.\n\nTo that end the two states create a district to be known as the \"Bi-State Metropolitan Development District\" (herein referred to as \"The District\") which shall embrace the following territory: The City of St. Louis and the counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson, and Franklin in Missouri and the counties of Madison, St. Clair, and Monroe in Illinois.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThere is created \"The Bi-State Development Agency of the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District\" (herein referred to as \"The Bi-State Agency\") which shall be a body corporate and politic. The bi-state agency shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) To plan, construct, maintain, own and operate bridges, tunnels, airports and terminal facilities and to plan and establish policies for sewage and drainage facilities;\n\n(2) To make plans for submission to the communities involved for coordination of streets, highways, parkways, parking areas, terminals, water supply and sewage and disposal works, recreational and conservation facilities and projects, land use pattern and other matters in which joint or coordinated action of the communities within the areas will be generally beneficial;\n\n(3) To charge and collect fees for use of the facilities owned and operated by it;\n\n(4) To issue bonds upon the security of the revenues to be derived from such facilities; and, or upon any property held or to be held by it;\n\n(5) To receive for its lawful activities any contributions or moneys appropriated by municipalities, counties, state or other political subdivisions or agencies; or by the federal government or any agency or officer thereof;\n\n(6) To disburse funds for its lawful activities, and fix salaries and wages of its officers and employees;\n\n(7) To perform all other necessary and incidental functions; and\n\n(8) To exercise such additional powers as shall be conferred on it by the legislature of either state concurred in by the legislature of the other or by act of Congress.\n\nNo property now or hereafter vested in or held by either state, or by any county, city, borough, village, township or other political subdivision, shall be taken by the bi-state agency without the authority or consent of such state, county, city, borough, village, township or other political subdivision, nor shall anything herein impair or invalidate in any way any bonded indebtedness of such state, county, city, borough, village, township or other political subdivision, nor impair the provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds of revenues derived from municipal property, or dedicating the revenues derived from any municipal property to a specific purpose.\n\nUnless and until otherwise provided, it shall make an annual report to the governor of each state, setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this agreement and any legislation thereunder.\n\nNothing contained in this compact shall impair the powers of any municipality to develop or improve terminal or other facilities.\n\nThe bi-state agency shall from time to time make plans for the development of the district; and when such plans are duly approved by the legislatures of the two states, they shall be binding upon both states with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this compact.\n\nThe bi-state agency may from time to time make recommendations to the legislatures of the two states or to the Congress of the United States, based upon study and analysis, for the improvement of transportation, terminal, and other facilities in the district.\n\nThe bi-state agency may petition any interstate commerce commission (or like body), public service commission, public utilities commission (or like body), or any other federal, municipal, state or local authority, administrative, judicial or legislative, having jurisdiction in the premises, for the adoption and execution of any physical improvements, change in method, rate of transportation, system of handling freight, warehousing, docking, lightering, or transfer of freight, which, in the opinion of the bi-state agency, may be designed to improve or better the handling of commerce in and through the district, or improve terminal and transportation facilities therein. It may intervene in any proceeding affecting the commerce of the district.\n\nThe bi-state agency shall consist of ten commissioners, five of whom shall be resident voters of the state of Missouri and five of whom shall be resident voters of the state of Illinois.

Each state reserves the right hereafter to provide by law for the exercise of the veto power by the governor thereof over any action of any commissioner appointed therefrom.\n\nUntil otherwise determined by the action of the legislature of the two states, the bi-state agency shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office or other administrative expenses, prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same.\n\nThe bi-state agency is hereby authorized to make suitable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the constitution or laws of the United States or of either state, or of any political subdivision thereof, and subject to the exercise of the power of Congress, for the improvement of the district, which when concurred in or authorized by the legislatures of both states, shall be binding and effective upon all persons and corporations affected thereby.\n\nThe two states shall provide penalties for violations of any order, rule or regulation of the bi-state agency, and for the manner of enforcing same.\n\nThe bi-state agency is authorized and directed to proceed with the development of the district in accordance with the articles of this compact as rapidly as may be economically practicable and is vested with all necessary and appropriate powers not inconsistent with the constitution or the laws of the United States or of either state, to effectuate the same, except the power to levy taxes or assessments.\n\nIt shall render such advice, suggestion and assistance to all municipal officials as will permit all local and municipal improvements, so far as practicable, to fit in with the plan.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nIn witness thereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals under authority vested in us by law.\n\nIn the presence of:\n\n(L. 1949 p. 558 § 1, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1809 merged with S.B. 881)\n\nRevisor's Note: Approved by Congress, 64 Stat. 568\n\nFor corresponding Illinois laws see Illinois Revised Statutes 1949 chapter 127, paragraph 63 r-1 et seq.

The bi-state development agency shall have the power to employ or appoint personnel to maintain safety and order and to enforce the rules and regulations of the agency upon the public mass transportation system, passenger transportation facilities, conveyances, and other property that the agency may own, lease, or operate, except bi-state may only employ peace officers through contracts with law enforcement agencies within the bi-state service area. The board of commissioners of the bi-state development agency shall determine the qualifications and duties of such personnel, subject to the limitations set forth in this section.\n\n2. All persons designated under subsection 1 of this section by the bi-state development agency to serve as personnel shall have the power to give warnings or to issue citations for violations of the rules and regulations of the agency and for any violation of section 70.441 (or a similar section under Illinois law) to request identification from those violators, and to remove those violators from the passenger transportation facilities or other property owned, leased or operated by the agency. All contracted personnel who are certified as peace officers shall also have the power to detain and to make arrests for the purpose of enforcing the rules and regulations of the agency and the provisions of section 70.441 (or a similar section under Illinois law). The personnel designated by the bi-state development agency under subsection 1 of this section are authorized to use only the equipment that is issued by the agency, and only while in the performance of their duties or while in direct transit to or from a duty assignment on the passenger transportation facilities and conveyances owned, controlled, or operated by the agency.

The jurisdiction of the personnel designated by the bi-state development agency under subsection 1 of this section shall be limited to passenger transportation facilities and conveyances (including bus stops) owned, controlled, or operated by the agency, but this restriction shall not limit the power of such persons to make arrests throughout the area in which the agency operates any public mass transportation system for violations committed upon or against those facilities from within or outside those facilities while such personnel are in hot or close pursuit of the violator. Nothing contained in this section shall either:\n\n(1) Relieve either signatory state or any political subdivision or agency of those states from its duty to provide police, fire, and other public safety service and protection; or\n\n(2) Limit, restrict or interfere with the jurisdiction of or the performance of duties of existing police, fire, and other public safety agencies.\n\n4. A citation issued by personnel designated under subsection 1 of this section shall be considered a release on the personal recognizance of the violator, provided that the citation shall contain a time and date for the appearance of the violator in circuit court to contest or admit the charges. Any violator failing to appear in circuit court when required to do so shall be subject to arrest upon order of the court. The circuit court may establish a schedule for the amount of fines for violations of section 70.441 (or a similar section under Illinois law). The court shall allow for the payment of the fine and court costs by mail instead of a court appearance for a violation in which the only penalty authorized by this section or section 70.441 is a fine.\n\n5. Those designated as personnel under subsection 1 of this section shall, upon the apprehension or arrest of any person, either issue a summons or citation against the person or deliver the person to the duly constituted police or judicial officer of the signatory state or political subdivision where the arrest is made, for disposition as required by law.\n\n6. The bi-state development agency shall provide for the training of personnel designated under subsection 1 of this section by the agency, and for this purpose the agency may enter into contracts or agreements for security training.

Notwithstanding the provisions of article V of the compact creating the bi-state development agency, any rules and regulations adopted under this subsection need not be concurred in or specifically authorized by the legislatures of either state. In the event that any such rules and regulations of the bi-state development agency contravene the laws, rules or regulations of a signatory state or its agency, the laws, rules and regulations of the signatory state or its agency shall apply, and the conflicting portions of the rules or regulations of the bi-state development agency shall be void within the jurisdiction of that signatory state. In the event that any rules or regulations of the bi-state development agency contravene the ordinances of any political subdivisions of the signatory states, the conflicting ordinances shall be void in or upon all agency passenger transportation facilities and conveyances. The rules and regulations of the bi-state development agency shall be uniform whenever possible throughout the area in which any passenger transportation facility or conveyance of the agency is located. The rules and regulations, and the amounts of fines for their violation adopted by the bi-state development agency shall be adopted by the agency's board of commissioners in accordance with all standards of due process, including, but not limited to, the holding of public hearings and subsequent publication of the agency rules and regulations and the amounts of fines for their violation in a manner designed to make them readily available to the public.\n\n9. Unless a greater penalty is provided by the laws of the signatory states, any violation of the rules and regulations of the agency shall constitute an infraction for which the authorized punishment shall be a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars and not greater than two hundred fifty dollars, in addition to court costs.\n\n10.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the creation of a metropolitan culture district as the means to implementation of the policy herein declared with the most beneficial and economical use of human and material resources.\n\nARTICLE III. DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\n(a)\"Metropolitan culture district\"means a political subdivision of the states of Kansas and Missouri which is created under and pursuant to the provisions of this compact and which is composed of the counties in the states of Kansas and Missouri which act to create or to become a part of the district in accordance with the provisions of Article IV.\n\n(b)\"Commission\"means the governing body of the metropolitan culture district.\n\n(c)\"Cultural activities\"means sports or activities which contribute to or enhance the aesthetic, artistic, historical, intellectual or social development or appreciation of members of the general public.\n\n(d)\"Cultural organizations\"means nonprofit and tax exempt social, civic or community organizations and associations which are dedicated to the development, provision, operation, supervision, promotion or support of cultural activities in which members of the general public may engage or participate.\n\n(e)\"Cultural facilities\"means facilities operated or used for sports or participation or engagement in cultural activities by members of the general public.\n\nARTICLE IV.

If additional ballot language is so submitted by the Commission, and a county governing body decides to place the ballot question before the qualified electors of that county, the additional ballot language shall be placed on the subject ballot by that governing body.\n\nG. When a majority of the qualified electors in the county or counties designated in the Program Plan for that Regional Program as one of those counties that must cast an affirmative vote on the ballot question before the sales tax may be imposed, have cast an affirmative vote, the Commission shall, in accordance with Article IX, Section A of this Compact, appoint an Oversight Committee for that Program Plan.\n\nH. The Commission shall have the power to contract and to be contracted with and to sue and to be sued.\n\nI. The Commission, when it deems it necessary and when requested to do so by an Oversight Committee, shall interpret and/or provide guidance and further details on a Program Plan to assist in the oversight of the appropriation and use of moneys by the Oversight Committee for that Program Plan.\n\nJ. In accordance with written guidelines adopted by the Commission, which guidelines shall be consistent with the Program Plans required by Article VI, Section C, the Commission may receive or provide donations, contributions, and grants or other support, financial or otherwise, from public or private entities, for Program Plans and the Eligible Uses set forth in Article VIII of this Compact.\n\nK. The Commission shall execute those contracts and agreements as an Oversight Committee shall direct to implement the Program Plan developed for an approved Regional Program, provided that, the Commission determines each contract is consistent with the Program Plan.\n\nL. The Commission may appoint advisory committees to provide input, consultation, guidance and assistance to the Commission on matters and issues related to any purposes for which the District and the Commission are hereby created.\n\nM.

The Commission may utilize assistance from any governmental or non-governmental entity, as it shall determine appropriate, in the form of personnel, technical expertise or other resources, to further the policies, purposes and goals of the District, as stated in Article II of this Compact.\n\nO. The Commission shall cause to be prepared annually a report on the operations and transactions conducted by the Commission during the preceding year. The report shall be an open record submitted to the legislatures and governors of the compacting states and to the governing bodies of the jurisdictions that are then a party to MARC's Articles of Agreement and of Buchanan County, Missouri, on or before March 15th of each calendar year, commencing on March 15th of the year following the year in which the certification described in Article IV, Section B hereof occurs. The Commission shall take those actions as are reasonably required to make this report readily available to the public.\n\nP. The Commission shall have the power to apply to the Congress of the United States for its consent and approval of this Compact, if it is determined by the Commission that this consent is appropriate.

The Commission shall have the power to perform all other necessary and incidental functions and duties and to exercise all other necessary and appropriate powers, not inconsistent with other provisions of this Compact or the constitution or laws of the United States or of the state or states in which its members are located, that it deems appropriate to effectuate the purposes for which this District and the Commission are created.\n\nVII. BALLOT QUESTIONS\n\nA. The Commission, as required by Article VI, Section C, shall develop Program Plans for Regional Programs to be submitted to the qualified electors within the District. A Program Plan developed by the Commission shall be available to the public for review and comment in advance of dates set by the Commission for submission of a ballot question to the electors in the District.\n\nB. The governing body of each county in the District shall determine whether the provision of financial support for a Regional Program is in the best interests of the citizens of the county and whether the levy of a sales tax to provide, on a cooperative basis with another county or other counties, for financial support of the Regional Program would be economically practicable and cost beneficial to the citizens of the county and the District. Each governing body that makes an affirmative determination with respect hereto shall adopt a resolution evidencing that determination and authorizing a vote of its citizens on the ballot question for the Regional Program, by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the members elect of the governing body.\n\nC. Upon adoption of a resolution pursuant to Section B of this Article, the governing body of that county, promptly after adoption of the resolution, shall request the county election commissioner to submit the ballot question for that Regional Program to the qualified electors of that county. Each such ballot question shall be printed on the ballot and in the notice of election. Each ballot question shall be submitted to the qualified electors of that county at the primary or general election next following the date the request was filed with the county election officer.\n\nD. The ballot for the proposition in each county shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nE. The governing body of each of the counties that requested their county election commissioner submit the ballot question to its qualified electors also shall provide their respective county election officers with copies of any additional language prepared by the Commission, pursuant to Article VI, Section F, which additional language shall be included by each such county on the ballot.\n\nF. The question of whether a sales tax for the support of a Regional Program involving a Public Transit System shall be imposed shall be submitted to qualified electors at the first election to be held on Regional Programs, pursuant to this Compact.\n\nG. The governing body of any county in the District that does not pass the resolution contemplated by Section B of this Article in time to cause the placement of the ballot question before the qualified electors of that county at the first election or any subsequent election to be held on Regional Programs, pursuant to this Compact, may adopt that resolution at any time thereafter, and that ballot question shall be provided to the election commissioner of that county and submitted to the qualified electors of the county at the next primary or general election, in accordance with Section C of this Article.\n\nH. In each county where a majority of the qualified electors voting in an election shall have cast an affirmative vote on a ballot question, that ballot question shall be approved.\n\nI. If a ballot question is submitted to the qualified electors of a county in the District, and the ballot question is not approved in that county, following defeat of the ballot question, the governing body of that county or counties may renew procedures to levy the sales tax in support of that Regional Program. A defeat of a ballot question in any county shall not affect the approval of that ballot question in any other county, which approval shall continue to have effect.\n\nJ. No county in the District shall levy a sales tax specified herein until the qualified electors in all the counties designated by the Commission in the Program Plan for the subject Regional Program, as those that must approve the sales tax, have approved the levy of the sales tax to support the Program Plan for that Regional Program.\n\nK. When, but only when, the electors in all of the counties designated by the Commission in the Program Plan for the Regional Program, as those that must approve the sales tax, have approved that ballot question, the governing body of each county that has approved that ballot question, at the first available opportunity, shall take all required actions to begin levying this tax.\n\nL. Any of the counties that have elected by a vote of its electors to levy a sales tax authorized by this Compact may cease to levy this sales tax upon the majority vote of the qualified electors of the county on a ballot question submitted to qualified electors asking if that county should cease to levy this sales tax. This vote shall take place in the same manner provided in this section for levying this sales tax; provided that, no vote to cease to levy this sales tax shall take place in any county on a date earlier than a date that is five years from the date that county approved this sales tax. Provided further, in no event shall any county cease to levy this sales tax until that county has entered into a written agreement with the Commission, which agreement shall provide for the terms of cessation, and shall specifically provide: (1) a means to ensure that the county pays a fair share of the outstanding obligations incurred by the District in furtherance of its established purposes; and (2) for the ongoing operations and maintenance or the termination of any facilities or services established in the county with support provided by the Commission. The governing body of a county that has decided by this vote to cease to levy this sales tax shall send formal written notice thereof to each of the other counties comprising the District. In no event, shall the county cease to levy the sales tax earlier than ninety days after this notice has been sent. If any county in the District decides to cease levying the sales tax, the status of the District as a political subdivision of the states of Kansas and Missouri shall be unaltered and that county shall continue to have the representation on the Commission, as set forth in Article V of this Compact.\n\nVIII. ELIGIBLE USES OF FUNDS\n\nA. The Commission shall only budget and authorize the appropriation of monies for the following eligible purposes:\n\n1. the actual and reasonably necessary expenses of the Commission and Oversight Committee, including, but not limited to, staff personnel, auditors, budget and financial consultation, legal assistance, administrative, operational, planning and engineering consultation and marketing, as well as for the actual and reasonably necessary expenses of individual Commission and Committee members that are incurred in the performance of their official duties; provided that, the Commission, in each fiscal year, shall not appropriate, for this purpose, any monies in excess of an amount that is equal to one percent of the funds appropriated to the Commission in that fiscal year by all of the counties imposing this sales tax; and\n\n2. the support of voter approved Regional Programs within the District;\n\n3. only pursuant to a contract with bodies corporate and politic, political subdivisions of the states of Missouri or Kansas and/or local units of government in the states of Missouri or Kansas, provided, however, the Commission may, in its discretion, require that entities contracted with shall procure a set percentage of Public Transit System services from third party contractors on a competitive basis; and\n\n4. only in support of a Regional Program in counties that have voted affirmatively to impose a sales tax in support of that Regional Program.\n\nB.

The number of individuals comprising the Oversight Committee shall be in the sole discretion of the Commission.\n\nB. An Oversight Committee shall be appointed within forty-five days of certification that the ballot question has been approved by the last of the counties designated by the Commission in the Program Plan for the Regional Plan, pursuant to Article VI, Section C, 1 hereof, to so certify and shall begin functioning immediately upon its appointment by the Commission.

Missouri local government employees' retirement system created — jurisdiction, Cole County — board of trustees, composition, terms — annual meeting — vacancies, how created — oath — appointment of actuary, attorney and investment counselor — mortality tables to be adopted — record of proceedings — hearings, notice — surety bonds — annual audits — expenses of board — rules and regulations, adoption. —1. For the purpose of providing for the retirement or pensioning of the officers and employees and the widows and children of deceased officers and employees of any political subdivision of the state, there is hereby created and established a retirement system which shall be a body corporate, which shall be under the management of a board of trustees herein described, and shall be known as the \"Missouri Local Government Employees' Retirement System\". Such system may sue and be sued, transact business, invest funds, and hold cash, securities, and other property. All suits or proceedings directly or indirectly against the system shall be brought in Cole County. The system shall begin operations on the first day of the calendar month next following sixty days after the date the board of trustees has received certification from ten political subdivisions that they have elected to become employers.\n\n2. The general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation of the system is vested in a board of trustees of seven persons: three persons to be elected as trustees by the members of the system; three persons to be elected trustees by the governing bodies of employers; and one person, to be appointed by the governor, who is not a member, retirant, or beneficiary of the system and who is not a member of the governing body of any political subdivision.\n\n3. Trustees shall be chosen for terms of four years from the first day of January next following their election or appointment, except that of the first board shall all be appointed by the governor by and with the consent of the senate, as follows:\n\n(1) Three persons who are officers or officials of political subdivisions, one for a term of three years, one for a term of two years, and one for a term of one year; and\n\n(2) Three persons who are employees of political subdivisions and who would, if the subdivision by which they are employed becomes an employer, be eligible as members, one for a term of three years, one for a term of two years, and one for a term of one year; and\n\n(3) That person appointed by the governor under the provisions of subsection 2 of this section. All the members of the first board shall take office as soon as appointed by the governor, but their terms shall be computed from the first day of January next following their appointment, and only one member may be from any political subdivision or be a policeman or fireman.\n\n4. Successor trustees elected or appointed as member trustees shall be members of the retirement system; provided, that not more than one member trustee shall be employed by any one employer, and not more than one member trustee shall be a policeman, and not more than one member trustee shall be a fireman.\n\n5. Successor trustees elected as employer trustees shall be elected or appointed officials of employers and shall not be members of the retirement system; provided, that not more than one employer trustee shall be from any one employer.\n\n6. An annual meeting of the retirement system shall be called by the board in the last calendar quarter of each year in Jefferson City, or at such place as the board shall determine, for the purpose of electing trustees and to transact such other business as may be required for the proper operation of the system. Notice of such meeting shall be sent by registered mail to the clerk or secretary of each employer not less than thirty days prior to the date of such meeting. The governing body of each employer shall certify to the board the name of one delegate who shall be an officer of the employer, and the members of the employer shall certify to the board a member of the employer to represent such employer at such meeting. The delegate certified as member delegate shall be elected by secret ballot by the members of such employer, and the clerk or secretary of each employer shall be charged with the duty of conducting such election in a manner which will permit each member to vote in such election. Under such rules and regulations as the board shall adopt, approved by the delegates, the member delegates shall elect a member trustee for each such position on the board to be filled, and the officer delegates shall elect an employer trustee for each such position on the board to be filled.\n\n7. In the event any member trustee ceases to be a member of the retirement system, or any employer trustee ceases to be an appointed or elected official of an employer, or becomes a member of the retirement system, or if the trustee appointed by the governor becomes a member of the retirement system or an elected or appointed official of a political subdivision, or if any trustee fails to attend three consecutive meetings of the board, unless in each case excused for cause by the remaining trustees attending such meeting or meetings, he or she shall be considered as having resigned from the board and the board shall, by resolution, declare his or her office of trustee vacated. If a vacancy occurs in the office of trustee, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled; provided, however, that the remaining trustees may fill employer and member trustee vacancies on the board until the next annual meeting.\n\n8. Each trustee shall be commissioned by the governor, and before entering upon the duties of his office, shall take and subscribe to an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution of the United States, and of the state of Missouri, and to demean himself faithfully in his or her office. Such oath as subscribed to shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state of this state.\n\n9. Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote in the board of trustees. Four votes shall be necessary for a decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board of trustees. Four trustees, of whom at least two shall be member trustees and at least two shall be employer trustees, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the board. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, a meeting need not be called or held to make any decision on a matter before the board. Each member must be sent by the executive secretary a copy of the matter to be decided with full information from the files of the board. The concurring decisions of four trustees may decide the issue by signing a document declaring their decision and sending the written instrument to the executive secretary, provided that no other trustee shall send a dissenting decision to the executive secretary within fifteen days after the document and information was mailed to him or her. If any trustee is not in agreement with the four trustees, the matter is to be passed on at a regular board meeting or a special meeting called for that purpose. The board shall hold regular meetings at least once each quarter, the dates of these meetings to be designated in the rules and regulations adopted by the board. Other meetings as deemed necessary may be called by the chairman or by any four trustees acting jointly.\n\n10. The board of trustees shall elect one of their number as chairman, and one of their number as vice chairman, and shall employ an executive secretary, not one of their number, who shall be the executive officer of the board. Other employees of the board shall be chosen only upon the recommendation of the executive secretary.\n\n11. The board shall appoint an actuary or a firm of actuaries as technical advisor to the board on matters regarding the operation of the system on an actuarial basis. The actuary or actuaries shall perform such duties as are required of him or her under sections 70.600 to 70.755, and as are from time to time required by the board.\n\n12. The board may appoint an attorney-at-law or firm of attorneys-at-law to be the legal advisor of the board and to represent the board in all legal proceedings.\n\n13. The board may appoint an investment counselor to be the investment advisor of the board.\n\n14. The board shall from time to time, after receiving the advice of its actuary, adopt such mortality and other tables of experience, and a rate or rates of regular interest, as shall be necessary for the actuarial requirements of the system, and shall require its executive secretary to keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for actuarial investigations of the experience of the system, and such data as shall be necessary for the annual actuarial valuations of the system.\n\n15. The board shall keep a record of its proceedings, which shall be open to public inspection. It shall prepare annually and render to each employer a report showing the financial condition of the system as of the preceding June thirtieth. The report shall contain, but shall not be limited to, a financial balance sheet; a statement of income and disbursements; a detailed statement of investments acquired and disposed of during the year, together with a detailed statement of the annual rates of investment income from all assets and from each type of investment; an actuarial balance sheet prepared by means of the last valuation of the system, and such other data as the board shall deem necessary or desirable for a proper understanding of the condition of the system.\n\n16. The board of trustees shall, after reasonable notice to all interested parties, conduct administrative hearings to hear and decide questions arising from the administration of sections 70.600 to 70.755; except, that such hearings may be conducted by a hearing officer who shall be appointed by the board. The hearing officer shall preside at the hearing and hear all evidence and rule on the admissibility of evidence. The hearing officer shall make recommended findings of fact and may make recommended conclusions of law to the board. All final orders or determinations or other final actions by the board shall be approved in writing by at least four members of the board. Any board member approving in writing any final order, determination or other final action, who did not attend the hearing, shall do so only after certifying that he or she reviewed all exhibits and read the entire transcript of the hearing. Within thirty days after a decision or order or final action of the board, any member, retirant, beneficiary or political subdivision adversely affected by that determination or order or final action may take an appeal under the provisions of chapter 536. Jurisdiction over any dispute regarding the interpretation of sections 70.600 to 70.755 and the determinations required thereunder shall lie in the circuit court of Cole County.\n\n17. The board shall arrange for adequate surety bonds covering the executive secretary and any other custodian of the funds or investments of the board. When approved by the board, said bonds shall be deposited in the office of the secretary of state.\n\n18. The board shall arrange for annual audits of the records and accounts of the system by a certified public accountant or by a firm of certified public accountants.\n\n19. The headquarters of the retirement system shall be in Jefferson City.\n\n20. The board of trustees shall serve as trustees without compensation for their services as such; except that each trustee shall be paid for any necessary expenses incurred in attending meetings of the board or in the performance of other duties authorized by the board.\n\n21. Subject to the limitations of sections 70.600 to 70.755, the board shall formulate and adopt rules and regulations for the government of its own proceedings and for the administration of the retirement system.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 141 § 2, A.L. 1974 S.B. 421, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1440, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2003 H.B. 131, A.L. 2013 H.B. 116)",

No such prior employment shall be so certified by an employer for any member unless he was employed by the employer within the one-year period immediately preceding the date an employer covers its employees and unless he is continuously employed by such employer from and after such date for (1) one year, or (2) until his death, or (3) until his total and permanent disability, whichever is earliest.\n\n3.

During the period of such disability his contributions to the system shall be suspended and any balance remaining to his credit in the members deposit fund shall be accumulated at regular interest.

However, if the member is eligible to receive retirement credits in a United States military service retirement system, he shall be permitted to purchase creditable prior service equivalent to his service in the armed services, but not to exceed four years, any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding. The purchase shall be effected by the member's paying to the retirement system an amount equal to the present value, on the date of payment, of the amount of the additional retirement allowance that would be obtained by virtue of the purchase of the additional service credit, using the interest rate specified by the board and the applicable mortality table adopted by the board and assuming continuous future service in the retirement system until, and retirement at, the age at which the minimum requirements of the retirement system for normal retirement or retirement with an allowance unreduced for retirement at an early age. The payment shall be made over a period of not longer than two years, measured from the date of election, and with compound interest on the unpaid balance.

The clerk or secretary of the political subdivision shall certify the election of the benefit program to the board within ten days after such vote. The effective date of the political subdivision's benefit program is the first day of the calendar month specified by such governing body, or the first day of the calendar month next following receipt by the board of the certification of election of benefit program, or the effective date of the political subdivision becoming an employer, whichever is the latest.

The limitation on increases in an employer's contribution provided by subsection 6 of section 70.730 shall not apply to any contribution increase resulting from an employer electing a benefit program which provides larger allowances.\n\n7. Subject to the provisions of subsections 8 and 9 of this section, for an allowance becoming effective on September 28, 1975, or later, and beginning with the October first which is at least twelve full months after the effective date of the allowance, the amount of the allowance shall be redetermined effective each October first and such redetermined amount shall be payable for the ensuing year. Subject to the limitations stated in the next sentence, such redetermined amount shall be the amount of the allowance otherwise payable multiplied by the following percent: one hundred percent, plus two percent for each full year (excluding any fraction of a year) in the period from the effective date of the allowance to the current October first. In no event shall such redetermined amount (1) be less than the amount of the allowance otherwise payable nor (2) be more than the amount of the allowance otherwise payable multiplied by the following fraction: the numerator shall be the Consumer Price Index for the month of June immediately preceding such October first (but in no event an amount less than the denominator below) and the denominator shall be the Consumer Price Index for the month of June immediately preceding the effective date of the allowance. As used herein,\"Consumer Price Index\"means a measure of the Consumer Price Index as determined by the United States Department of Labor and adopted by the board of trustees. As used herein\"the amount of the allowance otherwise payable\"means the amount of the allowance which would be payable without regard to these provisions redetermining allowance amounts after retirement.\n\n8. (1) The system establishes reserves for the payment of future allowances to retirants and beneficiaries. Should the board determine, after consulting with the actuary, that the established reserves are more than sufficient to provide such allowances, the board may increase the annual increase rate provided for in subsection 7 of this section, as it applies to any allowance payable, but in no event shall the total of all redetermined amounts as of October first of any year be greater than one hundred four percent of the allowances which would have been payable that October first without such redeterminations; provided, as of any redetermination date the same annual increase rate shall be applied to all allowances with effective dates in the range of November first to October first of the following year. The board may extend the provisions of subsection 7 of this section to allowances which became effective before September 28, 1975; provided such an action by the board shall not increase an employer contribution rate then in effect;\n\n(2) After August 28, 1993, the annual increase rate established by this subsection shall be a compound rate, compounded annually, and the four percent annual maximum rate shall also be a compound rate, compounded annually; provided, the use of such compounding shall not begin until October 1, 1993, and shall not affect redeterminations made prior to that date.\n\n9. Should the board determine that the provisions of subsections 7 and 8 of this section are jeopardizing the financial solvency of the system, the board shall suspend these provisions redetermining allowance amounts after retirement for such periods of time as the board deems appropriate.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 141 § 12, A.L. 1975 S.B. 16, A.L. 1977 H.B. 702, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1051 merged with H.B. 1050, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1098, A.L. 1993 H.B. 287, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1606, A.L. 1995 H.B. 416, et al. merged with S.B. 395, A.L. 2000 H.B. 1808, A.L. 2005 H.B. 261, A.L. 2025 H.B. 147 merged with S.B. 71)",

Optional retirement, election, when made — benefits, how computed — death of beneficiary, effect (member and beneficiary). —1. Except as otherwise provided herein, before the date the first payment of a person's allowance becomes due but not thereafter, a person about to become a retirant may elect to receive his or her allowance for life with or without a partial lump-sum distribution, as provided in this subsection. A person about to become a retirant may elect to receive a partial lump-sum distribution equal to twenty-four times the amount of his or her monthly allowance for life, not including any monthly temporary allowance which may be payable. Such lump sum shall be paid to the retirant, upon written application to the board, not fewer than ninety days nor more than one hundred fifty days after the date the first payment of his or her monthly allowance becomes due. The retirant's monthly life allowance shall be reduced to eighty-four percent if the retirant's age at the time of retirement is sixty, which percent shall be decreased by four-tenths of one percent for each year the retirant's age at the time of retirement is greater than sixty, or which percent shall be increased by four-tenths of one percent for each year the retirant's age at the time of retirement is less than sixty. The reductions in monthly life allowance in this subsection shall be calculated and applied before any reductions under subsection 2 of this section are calculated and applied.\n\n2. Before the date the first payment of a person's allowance becomes due but not thereafter, a person about to become a retirant may elect to have his or her allowance for life reduced but not any temporary allowance which may be payable, and nominate a beneficiary, as provided by option A, B, C, or D set forth below:\n\n(1) Option A. Under option A, a retirant's allowance payable to the retirant shall be reduced to a certain percent of the allowance otherwise payable to the retirant. If such first payment due date is on or after October 1, 1998, such percent shall be eighty-five percent if the retirant's age and the retirant's beneficiary's age are the same on such first due date, which shall be decreased by three-quarters of one percent for each year that the beneficiary's age is less than the retirant's age, or which shall be increased by three-quarters of one percent, up to a maximum of ninety percent, for each year that the beneficiary's age is more than the retirant's age. Upon the retirant's death three-quarters of the retirant's reduced allowance to which the retirant would have been entitled had the retirant lived shall be paid to his or her surviving beneficiary, nominated before such first payment due date but not thereafter, who was the retirant's spouse for not less than the two years immediately preceding such first payment due date, or another person aged forty years or older receiving more than one-half support from the retirant for not less than the two years immediately preceding such first payment due date.\n\n(2) Option B. Under option B, a retirant's allowance payable to the retirant shall be reduced to a certain percent of the allowance otherwise payable to the retirant. If such first payment due date is on or after October 1, 1998, such percent shall be ninety percent if the retirant's age and the retirant's beneficiary's age are the same on such first payment due date, which shall be decreased by one-half of one percent for each year that the beneficiary's age is less than the retirant's age, or which shall be increased by one-half of one percent, up to a maximum of ninety-five percent for each year that the beneficiary's age is more than the retirant's age. Upon the retirant's death one-half of his or her reduced allowance to which the retirant would have been entitled had the retirant lived shall be paid to the retirant's surviving beneficiary, nominated before such first payment due date but not thereafter, who was either the retirant's spouse for not less than the two years immediately preceding such first payment due date, or another person aged forty years or older receiving more than one-half support from the retirant for not less than the two years immediately preceding such first payment due date.\n\n(3) Option C. Under option C, a retirant's allowance payable to the retirant shall be reduced to ninety-five percent of the allowance otherwise payable to the retirant if such first payment due date is on or after October 1, 1998. If the retirant dies before having received one hundred twenty monthly payments of his or her reduced allowance, his or her reduced allowance to which the retirant would have been entitled had the retirant lived shall be paid for the remainder of the one hundred twenty months' period to such person as the retirant shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. If there is no such beneficiary surviving the retirant, the reserve for such allowance for the remainder of such one hundred twenty months' period shall be paid to the retirant's estate.\n\n(4) Option D. Some other option approved by the board which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the allowance to which the member is entitled under this system.\n\n3. The death of the beneficiary designated under option A or B of subsection 2 of this section before the death of the retirant after retirement shall, upon written notification to the system of the death of the beneficiary, cancel any optional plan elected at retirement to provide continuing lifetime benefits to the beneficiary and shall return the retirant to his or her single lifetime benefit equivalent, to be effective the month following receipt of the written notification of the death of the beneficiary by the system.\n\n4.
