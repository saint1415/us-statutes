At the regular general election in the year 1948, and every four years thereafter, the voters of each county of this state in counties of the second, third, and fourth classification shall elect a registered land surveyor as county surveyor, who shall hold office for four years and until a successor is duly elected, commissioned and qualified. The person elected shall be commissioned by the governor.\n\n2. No person shall be elected or appointed surveyor unless such person is a citizen of the United States, over the age of twenty-one years, a registered land surveyor, and shall have resided within the state one whole year. An elected surveyor shall have resided within the county for which the person is elected six months immediately prior to election and shall after election continue to reside within the county for which the person is surveyor. An appointed surveyor need not reside within the county for which the person is surveyor.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section, or any other law to the contrary, the county commission of any county of the third or fourth classification may appoint a surveyor following the deadline for filing for the office of surveyor, if no qualified candidate files for the office in the general election in which the office would have been on the ballot, provided that the notice required by section 115.345 has been published in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county. The appointed surveyor shall serve at the pleasure of the county commission, however, an appointed surveyor shall forfeit said office once a qualified individual, who has been duly elected at a regularly scheduled general election where the office of surveyor is on the ballot and who has been commissioned by the governor, takes office. The county commission shall fix appropriate compensation, which need not be equal to that of an elected surveyor.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 13190, A.L. 1945 p. 1759, A.L. 1978 H.B. 971, A.L. 1983 H.B. 133, A.L. 2003 H.B. 267, A.L. 2009 H.B. 481)\n\nPrior revisions: 1929 § 11571; 1919 § 12709; 1909 § 11291",

The physical evidence of a corner may have been entirely obliterated but the corner will be considered existent if its position can be recovered through the testimony of one or more witnesses who have a dependable knowledge of the original location. A legally reestablished corner shall have the same status as an existent corner;\n\n(3)\"Lost corner\", a corner whose position cannot be determined, beyond reasonable doubt, either from traces of the original marks or from acceptable evidence or testimony that bears upon the original position;\n\n(4)\"Monument\", the physical object which marks the corner point determined by the surveying process. The accessories, such as bearing trees, bearing objects, reference monuments, mounds of stone and other similar objects that aid in identifying the corner position, are also considered a part of a corner monument;\n\n(5)\"Obliterated, decayed or destroyed corner\", a position at whose point there are no remaining traces of the original monument or its accessories, but whose location has been perpetuated by subsequent surveys, or the point may be recovered beyond reasonable doubt by the acts and testimony of local residents, competent surveyors, other qualified local authorities or witnesses, or by some acceptable record evidence.

The excess or deficiency between two existent corners is so distributed that the amount of excess or deficiency given to each interval bears the same proportion to the whole difference as the record length of the interval bears to the whole record distance:\n\n(a)\"Single proportionate measurement\", a measurement of a line applied to a new measurement made between known points on a line to determine one or more positions on that line;\n\n(b)\"Double proportionate measurement\", a measurement applied to a new measurement made between four known corners, two each on intersecting meridional and latitudinal lines, for the purpose of relating the intersection to both.
