This section applies to a nuisance located within the boundaries of:\n\n(1) Any county with more than one million inhabitants; or\n\n(2) Any city or village located within the boundaries of any county with more than one million inhabitants.\n\n3. Any property owner who owns property within one thousand two hundred feet of a parcel of property that is alleged to be a nuisance may bring a nuisance action under this section against the offending property owner for the amount of damage created by such nuisance to the value of the petitioner's property including, but not limited to, diminution in value of the petitioner's property and court costs.\n\n4. An action for injunctive relief to abate a nuisance may be brought against the offending property owner under this section by:\n\n(1) Anyone who owns property within one thousand two hundred feet of a property that is alleged to be a nuisance; or\n\n(2) A neighborhood organization:\n\n(a) On behalf of any person or persons who own property within the boundaries of the geographic area described in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the neighborhood organization and who could maintain a nuisance action under this section or under the common law of private nuisance; or\n\n(b) On the neighborhood organization's own behalf with respect to a nuisance on property anywhere within the geographic boundaries described in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the neighborhood organization.\n\n5.

A sworn affidavit by the person who mailed or posted the notice describing the date and manner that notice was given shall be sufficient evidence to establish that the notice was given.\n\n(4) The notice shall specify:\n\n(a) The act or condition that constitutes the nuisance;\n\n(b) The date the nuisance was first discovered;\n\n(c) The address of the property and location on the property where the act or condition that constitutes the nuisance is allegedly occurring or exists; and\n\n(d) The relief sought in the action.\n\n6. A proceeding under this section shall:\n\n(1) Be heard at the earliest practicable date; and\n\n(2) Be expedited in every way.\n\n7.

An action for injunctive relief to abate a nuisance shall be heard by the court without a jury and shall not require proof that the party bringing the action has sustained damage or loss as a result of the nuisance.\n\n8. A copy of a notice of citation issued by the county, city, or village with jurisdiction over the property that is subject to an action under this section that shows the date the citation was issued shall be prima facie evidence of whether and for how long the property has been in violation of the code or ordinance provisions provided in the citation.\n\n9. When a property owner or neighborhood organization bringing the action prevails in such action, such property owner or organization may be entitled to an award for attorneys' fees and expenses, based on the amount of time reasonably expended, as ordered by the court, which award for attorneys' fees and expenses shall be entered as a judgment against the owner of the property on which the act or condition constituting the nuisance occurred or was located.\n\n10. (1) This section shall not be construed as to abrogate any equitable or legal right or remedy otherwise available under the law to abate a nuisance.\n\n(2) This section shall not be construed to grant standing for an action challenging any zoning application or approval.\n\n11. If a property owner sued under this section pleads and proves that a condition alleged by the plaintiff to be a nuisance is the subject matter of an order of the state department of natural resources, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the office of the Missouri attorney general and further pleads and proves that the property is in compliance with such order with respect to such condition, such proof shall be an affirmative defense to plaintiff's claim that such condition is subject to one or more of the remedies provided for under this section.\n\n(L. 2025 H.B. 199)",

To establish a neighborhood improvement district, the governing body of any city or county shall comply with either of the procedures described in subsection 2 or 3 of this section.\n\n2. The governing body of any city or county proposing to create a neighborhood improvement district may by resolution submit the question of creating such district to all qualified voters residing within such district at a general or special election called for that purpose. Such resolution shall set forth the project name for the proposed improvement, the general nature of the proposed improvement, the estimated cost of such improvement, the boundaries of the proposed neighborhood improvement district to be assessed, and the proposed method or methods of assessment of real property within the district, including any provision for the annual assessment of maintenance costs of the improvement in each year during the term of the bonds issued for the original improvement and after such bonds are paid in full.

As an alternative to the procedure described in subsection 2 of this section, the governing body of a city or county may create a neighborhood improvement district when a proper petition has been signed by the owners of record of at least two-thirds by area of all real property located within such proposed district. Each owner of record of real property located in the proposed district is allowed one signature. Any person, corporation, or limited liability partnership owning more than one parcel of land located in such proposed district shall be allowed only one signature on such petition. The petition, in order to become effective, shall be filed with the city clerk or county clerk.

Upon receiving the requisite voter approval at an election or upon the filing of a proper petition with the city clerk or county clerk, the governing body may by resolution or ordinance determine the advisability of the improvement and may order that the district be established and that preliminary plans and specifications for the improvement be made.

Upon request from any city, town, or village within the county, the county shall make available for inspection the distribution report provided to the county by the department of revenue. Any expenses incurred by the county in supplying such report to a city, town, or village shall be paid by such city, town, or village.\n\n8.

Such tax shall not become effective unless the governing body of the county submits to the voters of the county, on any date available for elections for the county, a proposal to authorize the governing body of the county to impose such tax. Such tax shall be in addition to all other taxes imposed by law. Such tax shall be stated separately from all other charges and taxes. The proceeds of such tax shall be used by the county solely for the support of the operations of hospital services in such county.\n\n3. The ballot of submission for such tax shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, such tax shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the election was held. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the question, such tax shall not become effective unless and until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters of the county and such question is approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the county voting on the question.\n\n4. Except as modified in this section, all provisions of sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed under this section.\n\n5. All moneys collected under this section by the director of the department of revenue on behalf of such county shall be deposited in a special trust fund, which is hereby created and shall be known as the \"County Hospital Operations Sales Tax Fund\", except that the director may deposit up to one percent for the cost of collection in the state's general revenue fund. Moneys in the fund shall be used solely for the designated purposes. Moneys in the fund shall not be deemed to be state moneys and shall not be commingled with any moneys of the state. The director may make refunds from the amounts in the fund and credited to the county for erroneous payments and overpayments made and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such county. Any moneys in the special fund that are not needed for current expenditures shall be invested in the same manner as other moneys are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n6. The governing body of a county that has adopted such tax may submit the question of repeal of the tax to the voters on any date available for elections for the county. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the repeal, the repeal shall become effective on December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such repeal was approved. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the repeal, such tax shall remain effective until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters and the repeal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question.\n\n7. Whenever the governing body of a county that has adopted such tax receives a petition, signed by a number of registered voters of the county equal to at least ten percent of the number of registered voters of the county voting in the last gubernatorial election, calling for an election to repeal such tax, the governing body shall submit to the voters a proposal to repeal the tax. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the repeal, the repeal shall become effective on December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such repeal was approved. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the repeal, such tax shall remain effective until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters and the repeal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question.\n\n8. If such tax is repealed or terminated by any means, all moneys remaining in the special trust fund shall continue to be used solely for the designated purposes. The county shall notify the director of the department of revenue of the repeal or termination at least ninety days before the effective date of the repeal or termination. The director may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayments of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such account. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of the repeal or termination, the director shall remit the balance in the account to the county and close the account of that county. The director shall notify such county of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the county.\n\n(L. 2025 H.B. 199)",

The authority may provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost;\n\n(d) Bonds issued by the authority shall be payable as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, out of all or any part of the general funds of the authority, including rents, revenues, receipts and income derived and to be derived for the use of any facility or combination of facilities, or any part or parts thereof, acquired, constructed, improved or extended in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds, including but not limited to convention center and stadium rentals, concessions, parking facilities and from funds derived from any other facilities or part or parts thereof, owned or operated by the authority, all or any part of which rents, revenues, receipts and income the authority is authorized to pledge for the payment of said principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, except that direct appropriations of tax revenues received by the authority pursuant to sections 67.656 and 67.657 or otherwise, other than appropriations for the payment of rent, shall not be pledged for the payment of such bonds. Neither the commissioners of the authority nor any person executing its bonds shall be personally liable on such bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. Bonds issued under the provisions of sections 67.653 to 67.655 shall not constitute a debt, liability, or obligation of this state, or any political subdivision of this state, nor shall any such obligations be a pledge of the faith and credit of this state, but shall be payable solely from the revenues and assets held by the authority. The issuance of bonds under sections 67.653 to 67.655 shall not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the state of Missouri or any political subdivision thereof, or the authority, to levy any form of taxation therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Each obligation or bond issued under sections 67.653 to 67.655 shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that the authority shall not be obligated to pay the same nor the interest on such bond, except from the revenues received by the authority or assets of the authority lawfully pledged therefor, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of this state or of any political subdivision of this state is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such obligation or bond. Bonds issued pursuant to this section may be further secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, trust agreement, pledge agreement, assignment or security agreement upon the rents, revenues, receipts and income herein referred to or any part thereof, or upon any leasehold interest or other property owned by the authority, or any part thereof, whether then owned or thereafter acquired, except that direct appropriations of tax revenues received by the authority pursuant to sections 67.656 and 67.657 or otherwise, other than appropriations for the payment of rent, shall not secure such bonds. The proceeds of such bonds shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in any such mortgage, deed of trust, trust agreement, pledge agreement or security agreement;\n\n(e) The authority shall fix and maintain rates and rentals and make and collect charges for the use and services of its interest in the facility or facilities or any part thereof owned or operated by the authority which shall be sufficient to pay the cost of operation and maintenance thereof, to pay the principal of and interest on any such bonds payable from such rates, rentals and charges and to provide funds sufficient to meet all requirements of the resolution by which such bonds have been issued;\n\n(f) The resolution authorizing the issuance of any such bonds may provide for the allocation of rents, revenues, receipts and income derived and to be derived by the authority from the use of any facility or part thereof, and of the proceeds received pursuant to sections 67.656 and 67.657, into such separate accounts as shall be deemed to be advisable to assure the proper operation and maintenance of any facility or part thereof and the prompt payment of any bonds issued to finance all or any part of the costs thereof. Such accounts may include reserve accounts necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of any such facility or any part thereof, and for the payment of any such bonds. Such resolution may include such other covenants and agreements by the authority as in its judgment are advisable or necessary properly to secure the payment of such bonds;\n\n(g) The authority may issue negotiable refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding, extending or unifying the whole or any part of such bonds then outstanding, or any bonds, notes or other obligations issued by any other public agency, public body or political subdivision in connection with any facilities to be acquired, leased or subleased by the authority, which refunding bonds shall not exceed the amount necessary to refund the principal of the outstanding bonds to be refunded and the accrued interest thereon to the date of such refunding, together with any redemption premium, amounts necessary to establish reserve and escrow funds and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the refunding. The authority may provide for the payment of interest on such refunding bonds at a rate in excess of the bonds to be refunded;\n\n(h) In case any of the commissioners or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery;\n\n(i) The authority is hereby declared to be performing a public function and bonds of the authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, accordingly, interest thereon and income therefrom shall be exempt from income taxation by the state of Missouri;\n\n(11) To condemn any and all rights or property of any kind or character, necessary for the purposes of the authority, in the manner provided in chapter 523, except that no property now or hereafter vested in or held by the state, the county or the city shall be taken by the authority without the authorization or consent of such party; provided however, that the authority shall provide relocation benefits to all individuals and businesses, occupying said property, in the same manner as such relocation benefits are provided pursuant to the federal Relocation Assistance Act;\n\n(12) To perform all other necessary and incidental functions, and to exercise such additional powers as shall be conferred by the general assembly or by act of Congress.\n\n2. The authority shall proceed to carry out its duties, functions and powers in accordance with sections 67.650 to 67.658, and the authority is vested with all necessary and appropriate powers not inconsistent with the constitution or the laws of the United States to effectuate the same, except the power to levy taxes or assessments. In no event shall the state be liable for any deficiency or indebtedness incurred by the authority.\n\n3. The authority shall grant or award at least fifteen percent of all contracts, employment opportunities, professional services and all other special contracts to persons who are members of a racial minority group, as defined in section 37.013.\n\n4. The authority and any city, county, other political subdivision or public agency obtaining funds pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of sections 34.073 and 34.076.\n\n(L. 1988 H.B. 1144, A.L. 1989 S.B. 295 & 312)",

Each pledge, agreement, lease, indenture, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made shall have been fully paid or provisions for such payment duly made.

Where the district is in more than one county, the executives, as defined in subdivision (4) of section 67.750, of the counties in the district, with the advice and consent of the governing bodies of each county shall, as nearly as practicable, evenly appoint such members and allocate staggered terms pursuant to subsection 2 of this section, with the county having the largest area within the district appointing a greater number of directors if the directors cannot be appointed evenly. No member of the governing body of the county or official of any municipal government located within the district shall be a member of the board and no director shall receive compensation for performance of duties as a director. Members of the board of directors shall be citizens of the United States and they shall reside within the district.

In the event that a vacancy exists before the expiration of a term, the governing body of the county shall appoint a member for the remainder of the unexpired term. Board members shall be elected for terms of three years. Such elections shall be held according to this section and the applicable laws of this state.

Any special purpose district formed under the provisions of a statute of this state requiring approval by the voters of the district, and for which no specific procedure is provided to terminate or dissolve such a district, may be dissolved as provided in this section and section 67.955.\n\n2. A petition describing the boundaries of the district sought to be dissolved shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the subject district is located or, if the subject district embraces lands in more than one county, with the clerk of the circuit court of the county having the largest acreage within the boundaries of the subject district. Such petition, in addition to such boundary description, shall allege that further operation of the subject district is inimical to the best interests of the inhabitants of the district and that the district should, in the interest of the public welfare and safety, be dissolved, and such other information as may be useful to the court in determining whether the petition should be granted and a decree of dissolution entered. Such petition shall also include a detailed plan for payment of all debt and obligations of the district at the time of dissolution. Such petition shall be accompanied by a cash deposit of fifty dollars as an advancement of the costs of the proceeding, and the petition shall be signed by eight percent or more of the voters of the district. The petition shall be verified by at least one of the signers thereof and shall be served upon the governing board of the district. The district shall be a party, and if the governing board in its discretion determines that such dissolution is not in the public interest, the district shall oppose such petition and pay all cost and expense thereof.\n\n3. Upon the filing of the petition, the petition shall be presented to the circuit court and such court shall fix a date for a hearing on such petition. The clerk of the court shall give notice of the filing of the petition in some newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proceedings are pending, and if the district extends into any other county or counties, such notice shall also be published in some newspaper of general circulation in such other county or counties. The notice shall contain a description of the subject boundary lines of the district and the general purposes of the petition, and shall set forth the date fixed for the hearing on the petition, which shall not be less than seven nor more than twenty-one days after the date of the last publication of the notice and shall be on some regular judicial day of the court in which the petition is pending. Such notice shall be signed by the clerk of the circuit court and shall be published in three successive issues of a weekly newspaper or in twenty successive issues of a daily newspaper.\n\n4. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the case or the hearing thereon from time to time until final disposition thereof.\n\n5. Exceptions to the dissolution of a district may be made by any voter or landowner of the district, and by the district as provided in this section. Such exceptions shall be filed not less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing on the petition. Such exceptions shall specify the grounds upon which the exceptions are filed, and the court shall take them into consideration in passing upon the petition and shall also consider the evidence in support of the petition and in support of the exceptions made. Unless petitioners prove that all debts and financial obligations of the district can be paid in full upon dissolution, the petition shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners.\n\n6. Should the court find that it would not be to the public interest to dissolve a district, the petition shall be dismissed at the costs of the petitioners. If, however, the court should find in favor of the petitioners, the court shall enter its interlocutory decree of dissolution, which decree shall provide for the submission of the question to the voters of the district. The decree of dissolution shall not become final and conclusive until it has been submitted to the voters residing within the boundaries described in such decree and approved by a majority of the votes cast. The decree shall provide for the submission of the question and shall fix the date thereof.\n\n7. The question shall be submitted in substantially the following form:\n\nShall the ______ district be dissolved?\n\n8. The returns shall be certified by the election authority to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the case. Upon receiving such certification, the court shall enter its order canvassing the returns and declaring the result of such election. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the court shall, in such order declaring the result of the election, enter a further order declaring the decree of dissolution to be final and conclusive. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the question, then the court shall enter a further order declaring such decree of dissolution to be void and of no effect. No appeal shall lie from any of such orders. In the event that the court declares the decree of dissolution to be final as provided in this subsection, the clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of such decree of dissolution and of such final order with the secretary of state, the recorder of deeds of the county or counties in which the district is located, and with the clerk of the county commission of the county or counties in which the district is located.\n\n9.

The directors shall not receive any compensation for their services, but may be reimbursed for all actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties from the moneys in the senior citizens' services fund.\n\n3. The administrative control and management of the funds in the senior citizens' services fund and all programs to be funded therefrom shall rest solely with the board of directors appointed under subsection 2 of this section, except, in counties, the budget for the senior citizens' services fund shall be approved by the governing body of the county prior to making of any payments from the fund in any fiscal year. The board of directors shall use the funds in the senior citizens' services fund to provide programs which will improve the health, nutrition, and quality of life of persons who are sixty years of age or older. The budget may allocate funds for operational and capital needs to senior-related programs in the county or city in which such property taxes are collected. No funds in the senior citizens' services fund may be used, directly or indirectly, for any political purpose. In providing such services, the board of directors may contract with any person to provide services relating, in whole or in part, to the services which the board itself may provide under this section, and for such purpose may expend the tax proceeds derived from the tax authorized by section 67.990.\n\n4. The board of directors shall elect a chairman, vice chairman, and such other officers as it deems necessary; shall establish eligibility requirements for the programs it furnishes; and shall do all other things necessary to carry out the purposes of sections 67.990 to 67.995. A majority of the board of directors shall constitute a quorum.\n\n5. The board of directors, with the approval of the governing body of the county or city, may accept any gift of property or money for the use and benefit of the persons to be served through the programs established and funded under sections 67.990 to 67.995 and may sell or exchange any such property so long as such sale or exchange is in the best interests of the programs provided under sections 67.990 to 67.995 and the proceeds from such sale or exchange are used exclusively to fund such programs. For a city not within a county, the board of directors may solicit, accept, and expend grants from private or public entities and enter into agreements to effectuate such grants so long as the transaction is in the best interest of the programs provided by the board and the proceeds are used exclusively to fund such programs.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 351 § 2, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1380, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271)",

Senior services and youth program sales tax — ballot language — trust fund created, use of moneys (Perry County). —1. The governing body of any county of the third classification without a township form of government and with more than eighteen thousand one hundred but fewer than eighteen thousand two hundred inhabitants may impose, by order or ordinance, a sales tax on all retail sales made within the county which are subject to sales tax under chapter 144. The tax authorized in this section shall not exceed one-fourth of one percent, and shall be imposed solely for the purpose of funding senior services and youth programs provided by the county. One-half of all revenue collected under this section, less one-half the cost of collection, shall be used solely to fund any service or activity deemed necessary by the senior service tax commission established in this section, and one-half of all revenue collected under this section, less one-half the cost of collection, shall be used solely to fund all youth programs administered by an existing county community task force. The tax authorized in this section shall be in addition to all other sales taxes imposed by law, and shall be stated separately from all other charges and taxes. The order or ordinance shall not become effective unless the governing body of the county submits to the voters residing within the county at a state general, primary, or special election a proposal to authorize the governing body of the county to impose a tax under this section.\n\n2. The ballot of submission for the tax authorized in this section shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the tax shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter immediately following the approval of the tax or notification to the department of revenue if such tax will be administered by the department of revenue. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the question, then the tax shall not become effective unless and until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters and such question is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question.\n\n3. On or after the effective date of any tax authorized under this section, the county which imposed the tax shall enter into an agreement with the director of the department of revenue for the purpose of collecting the tax authorized in this section. On or after the effective date of the tax the director of revenue shall be responsible for the administration, collection, enforcement, and operation of the tax, and sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply. All revenue collected under this section by the director of the department of revenue on behalf of any county, except for one percent for the cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund, shall be deposited in a special trust fund, which is hereby created and shall be known as the \"Senior Services and Youth Programs Sales Tax Trust Fund\", and shall be used solely for the designated purposes. Moneys in the fund shall not be deemed to be state funds, and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director may make refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to the county for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such county. Any funds in the special trust fund which are not needed for current expenditures shall be invested in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n4. In order to permit sellers required to collect and report the sales tax to collect the amount required to be reported and remitted, but not to change the requirements of reporting or remitting the tax, or to serve as a levy of the tax, and in order to avoid fractions of pennies, the governing body of the county may authorize the use of a bracket system similar to that authorized in section 144.285 and notwithstanding the provisions of that section, this new bracket system shall be used where this tax is imposed and shall apply to all taxable transactions. Beginning with the effective date of the tax, every retailer in the county shall add the sales tax to the sale price, and this tax shall be a debt of the purchaser to the retailer until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price. For purposes of this section, all retail sales shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer.\n\n5. All applicable provisions in sections 144.010 to 144.525 governing the state sales tax, and section 32.057, the uniform confidentiality provision, shall apply to the collection of the tax, and all exemptions granted to agencies of government, organizations, and persons under sections 144.010 to 144.525 are hereby made applicable to the imposition and collection of the tax. The same sales tax permit, exemption certificate, and retail certificate required by sections 144.010 to 144.525 for the administration and collection of the state sales tax shall satisfy the requirements of this section, and no additional permit or exemption certificate or retail certificate shall be required; except that, the director of revenue may prescribe a form of exemption certificate for an exemption from the tax. All discounts allowed the retailer under the state sales tax for the collection of and for payment of taxes are hereby allowed and made applicable to the tax. The penalties for violations provided in section 32.057 and sections 144.010 to 144.525 are hereby made applicable to violations of this section. If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid under this section, or in the event a determination has been made against the person for taxes and penalty under this section, the limitation for bringing suit for the collection of the delinquent tax and penalty shall be the same as that provided in sections 144.010 to 144.525.\n\n6. The governing body of any county that has adopted the sales tax authorized in this section may submit the question of repeal of the tax to the voters on any date available for elections for the county. The ballot of submission shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of repeal, that repeal shall become effective on December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such repeal was approved. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the repeal, then the sales tax authorized in this section shall remain effective until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters and the repeal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question.\n\n7. Whenever the governing body of any county that has adopted the sales tax authorized in this section receives a petition, signed by ten percent of the registered voters of the county voting in the last gubernatorial election, calling for an election to repeal the sales tax imposed under this section, the governing body shall submit to the voters of the county a proposal to repeal the tax. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the repeal, the repeal shall become effective on December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such repeal was approved. If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are opposed to the repeal, then the sales tax authorized in this section shall remain effective until the question is resubmitted under this section to the qualified voters and the repeal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question.\n\n8. If the tax is repealed or terminated by any means, all funds remaining in the special trust fund shall continue to be used solely for the designated purposes, and the county shall notify the director of the department of revenue of the action at least thirty days before the effective date of the repeal and the director may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the tax in such county, the director shall remit the balance in the account to the county and close the account of that county. The director shall notify each county of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the county.\n\n9. Each county imposing the tax authorized in this section shall establish a senior services tax commission to administer the portion of the sales tax revenue dedicated to providing senior services. Such commission shall consist of seven members appointed by the county commission. The county commission shall determine the qualifications, terms of office, compensation, powers, duties, restrictions, procedures, and all other necessary functions of the commission.\n\n(L. 2007 H.B. 205 merged with H.B. 795 merged with S.B. 22 merged with S.B. 30 merged with S.B. 233)",

A member shall file a notice of intent to sell with the governing commission pursuant to program guidelines if and when the member intends to place the guaranteed residence on the market for sale. Upon receipt of a notice of intent to sell, the governing commission shall provide the member with a copy of this section and a written description of the rights and responsibilities of both the member and the governing commission and the procedures for obtaining benefits; provided, however, that such information provided by the governing commission shall not restrict or advise the member with respect to the selection of a real estate broker or agent. The information shall be delivered to the member either in person or by registered mail. A member is not eligible to file notice of intent to sell until at least three years after the member's registration date.\n\n3. A member is required to offer the guaranteed residence for sale pursuant to the program guidelines, including the utilization of complete and proper methods for listing residential property, listing the guaranteed residence at a price equal to or greater than the guaranteed value and which reasonably can be expected to attract buyers, and providing reasonable access for potential buyers to see the guaranteed residence.\n\n4. A member may list the guaranteed residence pursuant to program guidelines with a real estate broker of the member's choice for up to ninety days following the date on which the member listed the residence.\n\n5. Within sixty days of receipt of a notice of intent to sell, the governing commission has the right to have the guaranteed residence inspected by a program appraiser, at the governing commission's expense, in order to determine if the guaranteed residence is in substantially the same condition as described by the program appraisal attached to the certificate of participation. If the guaranteed residence fails to meet this standard, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n(1) The program appraiser shall determine the percentage depreciation of the guaranteed residence due to failure to maintain the premises or due to physical perils or other causes not covered by the program;\n\n(2) This percentage figure shall be multiplied by the guaranteed value to determine the dollar depreciation;\n\n(3) This dollar depreciation shall be subtracted from the guaranteed value to derive a lower guaranteed value to be used for the purpose of determining the amount of payment pursuant to the program.\n\n6.

Ninety days after listing the guaranteed residence, a member shall be eligible to file a notice of intent to claim with the governing commission, pursuant to guidelines established by the governing commission, attesting to the fact that the member has followed program guidelines in offering the guaranteed residence for sale, that the member is unable to obtain an offer for purchase of the guaranteed residence for at least its guaranteed value, and that the member intends to file a claim against the program. Such notice shall include verifiable evidence of placement of the guaranteed residence on the market, the dates such placement took place, and shall list all reasonable offers to buy the property. Verifiable evidence may include a copy of advertisements for sale, a contract with a licensed real estate broker, or other evidence satisfactory to a majority of the governing commission.\n\n8. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to claim, the governing commission has sixty days during which it shall require the member to list the guaranteed residence at a price that the governing commission deems reasonable with a real estate broker of the member's choosing.

The rate of this tax may be changed from year to year by majority vote of the governing body of the municipality or county but in no case shall it exceed a rate of fifteen hundredths of a percent of the equalized assessed valuation of all real property in the area of the program, or the maximum tax rate approved by the voters of the area at the election which created the program or, in the case of a merged program, the maximum tax rate approved by the voters at the election authorizing the merger, whichever rate is lower. The commissioners shall cause the amount to be raised by taxation in each year to be certified to the county clerk or, in a city not within a county, to the taxing authority of such city in the manner provided by law, and any tax so levied and certified shall be collected and enforced in the same manner and by the same officers as those taxes for the purposes of the county and city within which the area of the commission is located. Any such tax, when collected, shall be paid over to the proper officer of the commission who is authorized to receive such tax. The governing commission may issue tax anticipation warrants against the taxes to be assessed for the calendar year in which the program is created and for the first full calendar year after the creation of the program.\n\n3. The moneys deposited in the guarantee fund shall, as nearly as practicable, be fully and continuously invested or reinvested by the governing commission in investment obligations which shall be in such amounts, and shall mature at such times, that the maturity or date of redemption at the option of the holder of such investment obligations shall coincide, as nearly as practicable, with the times at which moneys will be required for the purposes of the program. For the purposes of this section,\"investment obligation\"shall mean direct general municipal, state, or federal obligations which at the time are legal investments pursuant to the laws of this state and the payment of principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the governing body issuing them.\n\n4. The guarantee fund, including principal, interest, fees and all other sources of income, shall be used solely and exclusively for the purpose of providing guarantees to members of the particular guaranteed home equity program and for reasonable salaries, expenses, bills, and fees incurred in administering the program, and shall be used for no other purpose. Any municipality with a population of less than one thousand shall administer the program in conjunction with another such program in the same county, if another such program exists in such county.\n\n5. The guarantee fund shall be maintained, invested, and expended exclusively by the governing commission of the program for whose purposes it was created. Under no circumstance shall the guarantee fund be used by any person or persons, governmental body, or public or private agency or concern other than the governing commission of the program for whose purposes it was created. Under no circumstances shall the guarantee fund be commingled with other funds or investments. No commissioner or family member of a commissioner, or employee or family member of an employee, may receive any financial benefit, either directly or indirectly, from the guarantee fund. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit payment of expenses to a commissioner pursuant to sections 67.1603 and 67.1609 or payment of salaries or expenses to an employee pursuant to this section. As used in this subsection,\"family member\"means a spouse, child, stepchild, parent, brother, or sister of a commissioner or a child, stepchild, parent, brother, or sister of a commissioner's spouse.\n\n6. An independent audit of the guarantee fund and the management of the program shall be conducted annually and made available to the public through any office of the governing commission or a public facility such as a local public library located within the area of the program.\n\n7. Each political subdivision enacting a property tax pursuant to this section shall periodically calculate the amount of moneys necessary to pay the liabilities that may occur as a result of members seeking payments and shall adjust the tax rate within the limits allowed in this section to meet the liabilities. If the political subdivision determines that the fund contains or is likely to contain sufficient moneys, then the tax rate shall be reduced or eliminated until such calculations demonstrate that additional tax revenues are needed to fulfill commitments to members in the program.\n\n(L. 1999 S.B. 20)",

The question shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the county or city, or city not within a county, at a county or city or state general, primary or special election upon the motion of the governing body of the county or city, or city not within a county or upon the petition of eight percent of the qualified voters of the county or city, or city not within a county, determined on the basis of the number of votes cast for governor in such county at the last gubernatorial election held prior to the filing of the petition. The election officials of the county or city, or city not within a county, shall give legal notice as provided in chapter 115. The question shall be submitted in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the ordinance or order and any amendments thereto shall be in effect on the first day of the second calendar quarter after the director receives notification of the local sales tax. If a question receives less than the required majority, then the governing authority of the city or county, or city not within a county, shall have no power to impose the sales tax unless and until the governing authority of the city or county, or city not within a county, has submitted another question to authorize the imposition of the sales tax authorized by this section and such question is approved by the required majority of the qualified voters voting thereon. However, in no event shall a question under this section be submitted to the voters sooner than twelve months from the date of the last question under this section.\n\n2. After the effective date of any tax imposed under the provisions of this section, the director of revenue shall perform all functions incident to the administration, collection, enforcement, and operation of the tax and the director of revenue shall collect in addition to the sales tax for the state of Missouri the additional tax authorized under the authority of this section. The tax imposed under this section and the tax imposed under the sales tax law of the state of Missouri shall be collected together and reported upon such forms and under such administrative rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the director of revenue.\n\n3. All sales taxes collected by the director of revenue under this section on behalf of any city or county, or city not within a county, less one percent for the cost of collection, which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund after payment of premiums for surety bonds as provided in section 32.087, shall be deposited with the state treasurer in a special fund, which is hereby created, to be known as the \"Community Children's Services Fund\". The moneys in the city or county, or city not within a county, community children's services fund shall not be deemed to be state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of the state. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of money in the fund which was collected in each city or county, or city not within a county, imposing a sales tax under this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of officers of each city or county, or city not within a county, and the general public. Not later than the tenth day of each month, the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the fund during the preceding month by distributing to the city or county treasurer, or the treasurer of a city not within a county, or such other officer as may be designated by a city or county ordinance or order, or ordinance or order of a city not within a county, of each city or county, or city not within a county, imposing the tax authorized by this section, the sum, as certified by the director of revenue, due the city or county.\n\n4. The director of revenue may authorize the state treasurer to make refunds from the amounts in the fund and credited to any city or county, or city not within a county, for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such counties. Each city or county, or city not within a county, shall notify the director of revenue at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the expiration of the sales tax authorized by this section and the director of revenue may order retention in the fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of such tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the date of expiration of the tax authorized by this section in such city not within a county or such city or county, the director of revenue shall remit the balance in the account to the city or county, or city not within a county, and close the account of that city or county, or city not within a county. The director of revenue shall notify each city or county, or city not within a county, of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the city or county.\n\n5. Except as modified in this section, all provisions of sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed under this section.\n\n6. All revenues generated by the tax prescribed in this section shall be deposited in the county treasury or, in a city not within a county, to the board established by law to administer such fund to the credit of a special community children's services fund to accomplish the purposes set out herein and in section 210.861, and shall be used for no other purpose.

Any existing ordinance or new ordinance passed by a grandfathered political subdivision providing for payment of the greater of a linear foot fee or a gross receipts tax shall be enforceable only with respect to the linear foot fee.\n\n2. A grandfathered political subdivision shall not charge a linear foot fee for use of its right-of-way to a small local exchange telecommunications company as of December 31, 2019, as defined in section 386.020; provided that the small local exchange telecommunications company is providing internet access to customers within the rural areas of the state.\n\n3.

The information collected or assimilated by a community for use in a geographical information system need not be disclosed in a form which may be read or manipulated by computer, absent a license agreement between the community and the person requesting the information.\n\n5. Information collected or assimilated by a community for use in a geographical information system and disclosed in any form, other than in a form which may be read or manipulated by computer, shall be provided for a reasonable fee, as established by section 610.026. A community maintaining a geographical information system shall make maps and other products of the system available to the public. The cost of the map or other product shall not exceed a reasonable fee representing the cost to the community of time, equipment and personnel in the production of the map or other product. A community may license the use of a geographical information system. The total cost of licensing a geographical information system may not exceed the cost, as established by section 610.026, of the:\n\n(1) Cost to the community of time, equipment and personnel in the production of the information in a geographical information system or the production of the geographical information system; and\n\n(2) Cost to the community of the creation, purchase, or other acquisition of the information in a geographical information system or of the geographical information system.\n\n6.

Each trustee may be reappointed. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner in which the trustee vacating the office was originally appointed. The trustees shall not receive compensation for their services, but may be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses. The board shall elect a chair and other officers necessary for its membership. Trustees may be removed if:\n\n(1) By a two-thirds vote, the board moves for the member's removal and submits such motion to the governing body of the county from which the trustee was appointed; and\n\n(2) The governing body of the county from which the trustee was appointed, by a majority vote, adopts the motion for removal.\n\n9.

Any bonds, notes, and other obligations issued or delivered by the district may be secured by mortgage, pledge, or deed of trust of any or all of the property and income of the district. Every issue of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be payable out of property and revenues of the district and may be further secured by other property of the district, which may be pledged, assigned, mortgaged, or a security interest granted for such payment, without preference or priority of the first bonds issued, subject to any agreement with the holders of any other bonds pledging any specified property or revenues. Such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the district board, and shall bear such date or dates, and shall mature at such time or times, but not in excess of thirty years, as the resolution shall specify. Such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be in such denomination, bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such form, either coupon or registered, be issued as current interest bonds, compound interest bonds, variable rate bonds, convertible bonds, or zero coupon bonds, be issued in such manner, be payable in such place or places, and be subject to redemption as such resolution may provide, notwithstanding section 108.170.

There is hereby created the \"Exhibition Center and Recreational Facility District Sales Tax Trust Fund\", which shall consist of all sales tax revenue collected pursuant to this section. The director of revenue shall be custodian of the trust fund, and moneys in the trust fund shall be used solely for the purposes authorized in this section. Moneys in the trust fund shall be considered nonstate funds pursuant to Section 15, Article IV, Constitution of Missouri. The director of revenue shall invest moneys in the trust fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the trust fund. All sales taxes collected by the director of revenue pursuant to this section on behalf of the district, less one percent for the cost of collection which shall be deposited in the state's general revenue fund after payment of premiums for surety bonds as provided in section 32.087, shall be deposited in the trust fund. The director of revenue shall keep accurate records of the amount of moneys in the trust fund which was collected in the district imposing a sales tax pursuant to this section, and the records shall be open to the inspection of the officers of each district and the general public. Not later than the tenth day of each month, the director of revenue shall distribute all moneys deposited in the trust fund during the preceding month to the district. The director of revenue may authorize refunds from the amounts in the trust fund and credited to the district for erroneous payments and overpayments made, and may redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of the district.\n\n11. The sales tax authorized by this section is in addition to all other sales taxes allowed by law. Except as modified in this section, all provisions of sections 32.085 and 32.087 apply to the sales tax imposed pursuant to this section.\n\n12. Any sales tax imposed pursuant to this section shall not extend past the initial term approved by the voters unless an extension of the sales tax is submitted to and approved by the qualified voters in each county in the manner provided in this section. Each extension of the sales tax shall be for a period not to exceed twenty years. The ballot of submission for the extension shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast favor the extension, then the sales tax shall remain in effect at the rate and for the time period approved by the voters. If a sales tax extension is not approved, the district may submit another sales tax proposal as authorized in this section, but the district shall not submit such a proposal to the voters sooner than twelve months from the date of the last extension submitted.\n\n13. Once the sales tax authorized by this section is abolished or terminated by any means, all funds remaining in the trust fund shall be used solely for the purposes approved in the ballot question authorizing the sales tax. The sales tax shall not be abolished or terminated while the district has any financing or other obligations outstanding; provided that any new financing, debt, or other obligation or any restructuring or refinancing of an existing debt or obligation incurred more than ten years after voter approval of the sales tax provided in this section or more than ten years after any voter-approved extension thereof shall not cause the extension of the sales tax provided in this section or cause the final maturity of any financing or other obligations outstanding to be extended. Any funds in the trust fund which are not needed for current expenditures may be invested by the district in the securities described in subdivisions (1) to (12) of subsection 1 of section 30.270 or repurchase agreements secured by such securities. If the district abolishes the sales tax, the district shall notify the director of revenue of the action at least ninety days before the effective date of the repeal, and the director of revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or overpayment of the sales tax and to redeem dishonored checks and drafts deposited to the credit of such accounts. After one year has elapsed after the effective date of abolition of the sales tax in the district, the director of revenue shall remit the balance in the account to the district and close the account of the district. The director of revenue shall notify the district of each instance of any amount refunded or any check redeemed from receipts due the district.\n\n14. In the event that the district is dissolved or terminated by any means, the governing bodies of the counties in the district shall appoint a person to act as trustee for the district so dissolved or terminated. Before beginning the discharge of duties, the trustee shall take and subscribe an oath to faithfully discharge the duties of the office, and shall give bond with sufficient security, approved by the governing bodies of the counties, to the use of the dissolved or terminated district, for the faithful discharge of duties. The trustee shall have and exercise all powers necessary to liquidate the district, and upon satisfaction of all remaining obligations of the district, shall pay over to the county treasurer of each county in the district and take receipt for all remaining moneys in amounts based on the ratio the levy of each county bears to the total levy for the district in the previous three years or since the establishment of the district, whichever time period is shorter. Upon payment to the county treasurers, the trustee shall deliver to the clerk of the governing body of any county in the district all books, papers, records, and deeds belonging to the dissolved district.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 795, et al. merged with H.B. 833, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1442 merged with S.B. 644)",

The governing body of any county of the third classification without a township form of government and with more than forty-one thousand one hundred but fewer than forty-one thousand two hundred inhabitants may impose, by order or ordinance, a sales tax on all retail sales made within the county which are subject to sales tax under chapter 144. The tax authorized in this section shall be equal to one-eighth of one percent, and shall be imposed solely for the purpose of funding construction for a shelter for women and children, as defined in section 455.200. The tax authorized in this section shall be in addition to all other sales taxes imposed by law, and shall be stated separately from all other charges and taxes. The order or ordinance shall not become effective unless the governing body of the county submits to the voters residing within the county at a state general, primary, or special election a proposal to authorize the governing body of the county to impose a tax under this section.\n\n2. The ballot of submission for the tax authorized in this section shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the question, then the tax shall become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter immediately following notification to the department of revenue.

Beginning with the effective date of the tax, every retailer in the county shall add the sales tax to the sale price, and this tax shall be a debt of the purchaser to the retailer until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price.

In order to permit sellers required to collect and report the sales tax authorized by this section to collect the amount required to be reported and remitted, but not to change the requirements of reporting or remitting tax or to serve as a levy of the tax, and in order to avoid fractions of pennies, the district may establish appropriate brackets which shall be used in the district imposing a tax pursuant to this section in lieu of those brackets provided in section 144.285.\n\n6.

In the event a retailer has more than one place of business in this state which participates in the sale, the sale shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer where the initial order for the tangible personal property is taken, even though the order must be forwarded elsewhere for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment, or billing. A sale by a retailer's employee shall be deemed to be consummated at the place of business from which the employee works.\n\n(7) Subsequent to the initial approval by the voters and implementation of a sales tax in the district, the rate of the sales tax may be increased, but not to exceed a rate of one-half of one percent on retail sales as provided in this subsection.

In subsequent elections, the election judges shall certify the election results to the district board of directors. The ballot of submission shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters of the district voting thereon are in favor of the increase, the increase shall become effective December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such increase was approved.\n\n11. (1) There shall not be any election as provided for in this section while the district has any financing or other obligations outstanding.\n\n(2) The board, when presented with a petition signed by at least one-third of the registered voters in a district that voted in the last gubernatorial election, or signed by at least two-thirds of property owners of the district, calling for an election to dissolve and repeal the tax shall submit the question to the voters using the same procedure by which the imposing tax was voted. The ballot of submission shall be in substantially the following form:\n\n­­Such subsequent elections for the repeal of the sales tax shall be conducted in accordance with section 67.2520; provided, however, that the district board of directors may place the question of the repeal of the sales tax before the voters of the district, and the municipal clerk of the city, town, or village which originally conducted the incorporation of the district, or the circuit clerk of the court which originally conducted the incorporation of the district, shall conduct the subsequent election. In subsequent elections the election judges shall certify the election results to the district board of directors.\n\n(3) If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the qualified voters of the district voting thereon are in favor of repeal, that repeal shall become effective December thirty-first of the calendar year in which such repeal was approved or after the repayment of the district's indebtedness, whichever occurs later.\n\n12. (1) At such time as the board of directors of the district determines that further operation of the district is not in the best interests of the inhabitants of the district, and that the district should dissolve, the board shall submit for a vote in an election held throughout the district the question of whether the district should be abolished. The question shall be submitted in substantially the following form:\n\n(2) The district board shall not propose the question to abolish the district while there are outstanding claims or causes of action pending against the district, while the district liabilities exceed its assets, while indebtedness of the district is outstanding, or while the district is insolvent, in receivership or under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Prior to submitting the question to abolish the district to a vote of the entire district, the state auditor shall audit the district to determine the financial status of the district, and whether the district may be abolished pursuant to law. The vote on the abolition of the district shall be conducted by the municipal clerk of the city, town, or village in which the district is located. The procedure shall be the same as in section 67.2520, except that the question shall be determined by the qualified voters of the entire district. No individual subdistrict may be abolished, except at such time as the district is abolished.\n\n(3) While the district still exists, it shall continue to accrue all revenues to which it is entitled at law.\n\n(4) Upon receipt by the board of directors of the district of the certification by the city, town, or village in which the district is located that the majority of those voting within the entire district have voted to abolish the district, and if the state auditor has determined that the district's financial condition is such that it may be abolished pursuant to law, then the board of directors of the district shall:\n\n(a) Sell any remaining district real or personal property it wishes, and then transfer the proceeds and any other real or personal property owned by the district to the city, town, or village in which the district is located, including revenues due and owing the district, for its further use and disposition;\n\n(b) Terminate the employment of any remaining district employees, and otherwise conclude its affairs;\n\n(c) At a public meeting of the district, declare by a resolution of the board of directors passed by a majority vote that the district has been abolished effective that date;\n\n(d) Cause copies of that resolution under seal to be filed with the secretary of state and the city, town, or village in which the district is located.\n\n­­Upon the completion of the final act specified in this subsection, the legal existence of the district shall cease.\n\n(5) The legal existence of the district shall not cease for a period of two years after voter approval of the abolition.\n\n(L. 2004 H.B. 795, et al. merged with H.B. 833 merged with S.B. 732 merged with S.B. 1155)\n\n*Words \"of this section\" appear here in original rolls of H.B. 795, et al., H.B. 833, and S.B. 732, 2004.",

      "text": "Title VI COUNTY, TOWNSHIP AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION GOVERNMENT\n\n67.2679. Purpose statement — preemption of regulation of video services — state-issued video services authorization required, procedure. —1. The general assembly finds and declares it to be the policy of the state of Missouri that consumers deserve the benefit of competition among all providers of video programming. Creating a process for securing a state-issued video service authorization best promotes the substantial interest of the state of Missouri in facilitating a competitive marketplace that will, in turn, encourage investment and the deployment of new and innovative services in political subdivisions and provide benefits to the citizens of this state. The general assembly further finds and declares that franchise entities will benefit from immediate availability of the state-issued video service authorization to all video service providers, including new entrants and incumbent cable operators. In addition to the benefits to franchise entities found in sections 67.2675 to 67.2714, this immediate availability of state-issued video service authorization will promote fair competition among all video service providers in a local market and thereby provide new revenues to political subdivisions derived from additional video service customers, and the purchase of additional video services by such customers, and the sale of additional advertising by video service providers. This policy will provide a more predictable source of funding for franchise entities which will continue beyond the natural terms of all existing franchise agreements. The franchise entities will also experience cost savings associated with the administrative convenience of the enactment of the state-issued video service authorization. These benefits are full and adequate consideration to franchise entities, as the term \"consideration\" is used in Article III, Section 39(5) of the Missouri Constitution.\n\n2. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, upon issuance of a video service authorization, any existing or future franchise or ordinance adopted by a franchise entity that purports to regulate video service or video service networks or the franchising of video service providers shall be preempted as applied to such video service provider.\n\n3. No person shall commence providing video service or commence construction of a video service network in any area until such person has obtained a state-issued video service authorization, under the provisions of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714.\n\n4. The public service commission shall have the exclusive authority to authorize any person to construct or operate a video service network or offer video service in any area of this state. Notwithstanding provisions of this section to the contrary, a person with an existing and valid authorization to occupy the public rights-of-way may construct a video service network without first obtaining a video service authorization, but such person must obtain a video service authorization prior to commencing the provision of video service and otherwise comply with the provisions of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714. For purposes of the federal Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 521, et seq., the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and all applicable state laws and regulations, the public service commission shall be considered the sole franchising authority for the state, except with respect to a person that continues to provide video service under a franchise, franchise extension, or expired franchise or ordinance previously granted by a franchise entity. The public service commission shall have no authority to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of video service, except to the extent explicitly provided under sections 67.2675 to 67.2714.\n\n5. Any person seeking to commence providing video service in this state shall file an application for a video service authorization covering a franchise area or franchise areas with the public service commission and provide written notice to the affected political subdivisions of its intent to provide video service. The public service commission shall make such application public by posting a copy of the application on its website within three days of filing.\n\n6. A holder of a video service authorization who seeks to include additional political subdivisions to be served must file with the public service commission a notice of change to its video service authorization that reflects the additional political subdivisions to be served.\n\n7. The public service commission shall issue a video service authorization allowing the video service provider to offer video service in the franchise area of each political subdivision set forth in the application within thirty days of receipt of an affidavit submitted by the applicant and signed by an officer or general partner of the applicant affirming the following:\n\n(1) That the video service authorization holder agrees to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations;\n\n(2) A list of political subdivisions to be served by the applicant;\n\n(3) The location of the principal place of business and the names of the principal executive officers of the applicant;\n\n(4) That the video service provider has filed or will timely file with the Federal Communications Commission all forms required by that agency prior to offering video service;\n\n(5) That the video service provider agrees to comply with all applicable regulations concerning use of the public rights-of-way as provided in sections 67.1830 to 67.1846; and\n\n(6) That the video service provider is legally, financially, and technically qualified to provide video service.\n\n8. The video service authorization issued by the public service commission shall contain the following:\n\n(1) A grant of authority to provide video service in the franchise area of each political subdivision set forth in the application; and\n\n(2) A grant of authority to construct a video service network along, across, or on public rights-of-way for the delivery of video service to the extent the video service provider or an affiliate did not otherwise possess a valid authorization to occupy the public rights-of-way.\n\n9. (1) No existing franchise or ordinance issued by a franchising entity shall be renewed or extended beyond the expiration date of such franchise. Any person providing video service under a franchise, franchise extension or expired franchise or ordinance previously granted by a franchise entity may, at its option:\n\n(a) Continue to provide service under the terms and conditions of such franchise, franchise extension, or ordinance; or\n\n(b) Apply for a video service authorization as provided under this section in lieu of any or all such franchises, franchise extensions, or expired franchises; or\n\n(c) Automatically convert the franchise, franchise extension, or expired franchise in a political subdivision into a state-issued video service authorization, any time after a video service provider other than an incumbent cable operator obtains a video service authorization for such political subdivision, provided that notice of the automatic conversion to the public service commission and the affected political subdivision is made and upon compliance with the provisions of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714.\n\n(2) The franchise, franchise extension, or expired franchise previously granted by the franchise entity will terminate upon issuance of a video service authorization to the video service provider. The terms of such video service authorization shall be as provided under the provisions of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714 and shall supersede the terms and conditions of the franchise, franchise extension, or expired franchise previously granted by the franchise entity.\n\n10. At the time that any video service authorization is issued by the public service commission, the public service commission shall immediately make such issuance public by posting information on its website relating to the video service authorization, including specifically all political subdivisions covered by that authorization and the video service provider fee imposed.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 284)",

(1) In the case of repeated, willful, and material violations of the provisions of this section by a video service provider, a franchise entity may file a complaint on behalf of a resident harmed by such violations with the administrative hearing commission seeking an order revoking the video service provider's franchise for that political subdivision.

Such limits shall constitute the total number of PEG channels that may be designated on all video service networks that share a common headend, regardless of the number of franchise entities or other political subdivisions served by such headend. The video service provider may provide such channels on any service tier that is purchased by more than fifty percent of its customers. All video service providers serving a political subdivision shall be required to provide the same number of PEG access channels as the incumbent video service provider existing on the date of enactment of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any franchise or ordinance granted by a franchise entity prior to the date of enactment of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714, this section, rather than the franchise or ordinance, shall apply to the designation of PEG access channels by an incumbent cable operator operating under such franchise or ordinance; provided, however, that if such franchise or ordinance requires more PEG access channels than the applicable limit specified in subsection 1 of this section, the requirement in the franchise or ordinance shall apply in lieu of such limit; provided further, that the incumbent cable operator may nonetheless be required to activate additional PEG channel or channels, up to such limit, to the extent the political subdivision certifies that such additional channel or channels will be substantially utilized, as defined in subsection 4 of this section.\n\n3. Any PEG channel designated pursuant to this section that is not substantially utilized, as defined in subsection 4 of this section, by the franchise entity shall no longer be made available to the franchise entity, but may be programmed at the video service provider's discretion. At such time as the governing body of a franchising entity makes a finding and certifies that a channel that has been reclaimed by a video service provider under this subsection will be substantially utilized, the video service provider shall restore the reclaimed channel within one hundred*twenty days, but shall be under no obligation to carry that channel on any specific tier.\n\n4. For purposes of this section, a PEG channel shall be considered\"substantially utilized\"when forty hours per week are locally programmed on that channel for at least three consecutive months. In determining whether a PEG channel is substantially utilized, a program may be counted not more than four times during a calendar week.\n\n5. Except as provided in this section, a franchise entity or political subdivision may not require a video service provider to provide any funds, services, programming, facilities, or equipment related to public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity. The operation of any PEG access channel provided pursuant to this section and the production of any programming that appears on each such channel shall be the sole responsibility of the franchise entity or its duly appointed agent receiving the benefit of such channel, and the video service provider shall bear only the responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each such channel to subscribers.\n\n6. The franchise entity must ensure that all transmissions of content and programming provided by or arranged by it to be transmitted over a PEG channel by a video service provider are delivered and submitted to the video service provider in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and transmitted by such video service provider holder over its network without further alteration or change in the content or transmission signal, and which is compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the video service provider to deliver its video services.\n\n7. The franchise entity shall make the programming of any PEG access channel available to all video service providers in such franchise entity in a nondiscriminatory manner. Each video service provider shall be responsible for providing the connectivity to the franchise entity's or its duly appointed agent's PEG access channel distribution points existing as of effective date of enactment of sections 67.2675 to 67.2714. Where technically necessary and feasible, video service providers in the same franchise entity shall use reasonable efforts and shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their video service networks on mutually acceptable rates, terms, and conditions for the purpose of transmitting PEG programming within such franchise entity. A video service provider shall have no obligation to provide such interconnection to a new video service provider at more than one point per headend, regardless of the number of franchise entities or other political subdivisions served by such headend. The video service provider requesting interconnection shall be responsible for any costs associated with such interconnection, including signal transmission from the origination point to the point of interconnection. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable microwave link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection acceptable to the person providing the interconnect.\n\n8.

To the extent such incumbent cable operator provides such support in the form of a percentage of gross revenue or a per-subscriber fee, any other video service provider shall pay the same percentage of gross revenue or per-subscriber fee as the incumbent cable operator. To the extent the incumbent cable operator provides such support in the form of a lump sum payment without an offset to its gross receipts fee, any other video service provider shall be responsible for a pro rata share of such payment made by the incumbent cable operator after the date on which the other video service provider commences service in a particular political subdivision, based on its proportion of video service customers in such political subdivision. To the extent the incumbent cable operator provides such support on an in-kind basis after the date on which the other video service provider commences service in a particular political subdivision, any other video service provider shall pay the political subdivision a sum equal to the pro rata amount of the fair market value of such support based on its proportion of video service customers in such political subdivision.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, the proportion of video service customers of a video service provider shall be determined based on the relative number of subscribers as of the end of the prior calendar year as reported by all incumbent cable operators and holders of video service authorizations. A franchising entity acting under this subsection shall notify a video service provider of the amount of such fee on an annual basis, beginning one year after issuance of the video service authorization.\n\n9. Neither the public service commission nor any political subdivision may require a video service provider to provide any institutional network or equivalent capacity on its video service network.

The public service commission may grant the waiver or extension only if the provider has made substantial and continuous effort to meet the requirements of this section. If an extension is granted, the public service commission shall establish a new compliance deadline. If a waiver is granted, the public service commission shall specify the requirement or requirements waived.\n\n8.

As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Construction manager\", the legal entity that proposes to enter into a construction manager-at-risk contract under this section;\n\n(2)\"Construction manager-at-risk\", a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity that assumes the risk for the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, or repair of a project at the contracted price as a general contractor and provides consultation to a political subdivision regarding construction during and after the design of the project.\n\n2. Any political subdivision may use the construction manager-at-risk method for: civil works projects such as roads, streets, bridges, utilities, water supply projects, water plants, wastewater plants, water distribution and wastewater conveyance facilities, airport runways and taxiways, storm drainage and flood control projects, or transit projects commonly designed by professional engineers in excess of two million dollars; and noncivil works projects such as buildings, site improvements, and other structures, habitable or not, commonly designed by architects in excess of three million dollars. In using that method and in entering into a contract for the services of a construction manager-at-risk, the political subdivision shall follow the procedures prescribed by this section.\n\n3. The political subdivision shall publicly disclose at a regular meeting its intent to utilize the construction manager-at-risk method and its selection criteria at least one week prior to publishing the request for qualifications. Before or concurrently with selecting a construction manager-at-risk, the political subdivision shall select or designate an engineer or architect who shall prepare the construction documents for the project and who shall comply with all state laws, as applicable. If the engineer or architect is not a full-time employee of the political subdivision, the political subdivision shall select the engineer or architect on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications as provided by sections 8.285 to 8.291. The political subdivision's engineer or architect for a project may not serve, alone or in combination with another, as the construction manager-at-risk. This subsection does not prohibit a political subdivision's engineer or architect from providing customary construction phase services under the engineer's or architect's original professional service agreement in accordance with applicable licensing laws.\n\n4. The political subdivision may provide or contract for, independently of the construction manager-at-risk, inspection services, testing of construction materials, engineering, and verification of testing services necessary for acceptance of the project by the political subdivision.\n\n5. The political subdivision shall select the construction manager-at-risk in a two-step process. The political subdivision shall prepare a request for qualifications, for the case of the first step of the two-step process, that includes general information on the project site, project scope, schedule, selection criteria, and the time and place for receipt of proposals or qualifications, as applicable, and other information that may assist the political subdivision in its selection of a construction manager-at-risk. The political subdivision shall state the selection criteria in the request for proposals or qualifications, as applicable. The selection criteria may include the construction manager's experience, past performance, safety record, proposed personnel and methodology, and other appropriate factors that demonstrate the capability of the construction manager-at-risk. The political subdivision shall not request fees or prices in step one. In step two, the political subdivision may request that five or fewer construction managers, selected solely on the basis of qualifications, provide additional information, including the construction manager-at-risk's proposed fee and its price for fulfilling the general conditions. Qualifications shall account for a minimum of forty percent of the evaluation. Cost shall account for a maximum of sixty percent of the evaluation.\n\n6. The political subdivision shall publish the request for proposals or qualifications by publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the political subdivision is located once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to opening the proposals or qualifications submissions or by a virtual notice procedure that notifies interested parties for at least twenty various purchases, design contracts, construction contracts, or other contracts each year for the political subdivision.\n\n7. For each step, the political subdivision shall receive, publicly open, and read aloud the names of the construction managers. Within forty-five days after the date of opening the proposals or qualification submissions, the political subdivision or its representative shall evaluate and rank each proposal or qualification submission submitted in relation to the criteria set forth in the request for proposals or request for qualifications. The political subdivision shall interview at least two of the top qualified offerors as part of the final selection.\n\n8. The political subdivision or its representative shall select the construction manager that submits the proposal that offers the best value for the political subdivision based on the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluation. The political subdivision or its representative shall first attempt to negotiate a contract with the selected construction manager. If the political subdivision or its representative is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the selected construction manager, the political subdivision or its representative shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that construction manager and proceed to negotiate with the next construction manager in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or negotiations with all ranked construction managers end.\n\n9. A construction manager-at-risk shall publicly advertise, in the manner prescribed by chapter 50, and receive bids or proposals from trade contractors or subcontractors for the performance of all major elements of the work other than the minor work that may be included in the general conditions. A construction manager-at-risk may seek to perform portions of the work itself if the construction manager-at-risk submits its sealed bid or sealed proposal for those portions of the work in the same manner as all other trade contractors or subcontractors. All sealed bids or proposals shall be submitted at the time and location as specified in the advertisement for bids or proposals and shall be publicly opened and the identity of each bidder and their bid amount shall be read aloud. The political subdivision shall have the authority to restrict the construction manager-at-risk from submitting bids to perform portions of the work.\n\n10. The construction manager-at-risk and the political subdivision or its representative shall review all trade contractor, subcontractor, or construction manager-at-risk bids or proposals in a manner that does not disclose the contents of the bid or proposal during the selection process to a person not employed by the construction manager-at-risk, engineer, architect, or political subdivision involved with the project. If the construction manager-at-risk submitted bids or proposals, the political subdivision shall determine if the construction manager-at-risk's bid or proposal offers the best value for the political subdivision. After all proposals have been evaluated and clarified, the award of all subcontracts shall be made public.\n\n11. If the construction manager-at-risk reviews, evaluates, and recommends to the political subdivision a bid or proposal from a trade contractor or subcontractor but the political subdivision requires another bid or proposal to be accepted, the political subdivision shall compensate the construction manager-at-risk by a change in price, time, or guaranteed maximum cost for any additional cost and risk that the construction manager-at-risk may incur because of the political subdivision's requirement that another bid or proposal be accepted.\n\n12. If a selected trade contractor or subcontractor materially defaults in the performance of its work or fails to execute a subcontract after being selected in accordance with this section, the construction manager-at-risk may itself, without advertising, fulfill the contract requirements or select a replacement trade contractor or subcontractor to fulfill the contract requirements. The penal sums of the performance and payment bonds delivered to the political subdivision shall each be in an amount equal to the fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price. The construction manager-at-risk shall deliver the bonds not later than the tenth day after the date the fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price is established.\n\n13. Any political subdivision engaged in a project under this section, which impacts a railroad regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration, shall consult with the affected railroad on required specifications relating to clearance, safety, insurance, and indemnification to be included in the construction documents for such project.\n\n14. This section shall not apply to:\n\n(1) Any metropolitan sewer district established under Article VI, Section 30(a) of the Constitution of Missouri;\n\n(2) Any special charter city, or any city or county governed by home rule under Article VI, Sections 18(a) to 18(r) or 19 of the Constitution of Missouri that has adopted a construction manager-at-risk method via ordinance, rule or regulation.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 2376, A.L. 2025 H.B. 199)",

The political subdivision shall publicly disclose at a regular meeting its intent to utilize the design-build method and its project design criteria at least one week prior to publishing the request for proposals. Notice of requests for proposals shall be advertised by publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the political subdivision is located once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to opening the proposals, or by a virtual notice procedure that notifies interested parties for at least twenty various purchases, design contracts, construction contracts, or other contracts each year for the political subdivision.

This process of short listing shall narrow the number of qualified design-builders to not more than five nor fewer than two. Under no circumstances shall price or fees be a part of the prequalification criteria. Design-builders may be interviewed in either phase I or phase II of the process.

For all other bidders, cost points shall be calculated by reducing the maximum points available in phase III by at least one percent for each percentage point by which the bidder exceeds the lowest bid and the points assigned shall be added to the points assigned for phase II for each design-builder;\n\n(5) If the political subdivision determines that it is not in the best interest of the political subdivision to proceed with the project pursuant to the proposal offered by the design-builder with the highest total number of points, the political subdivision shall reject all proposals. In this event, all qualified and responsive design-builders with lower point totals shall receive a stipend and the responsive design-builder with the highest total number of points shall receive an amount equal to two times the stipend.

Pole attachment and pole defined — denial of permit on nondiscriminatory basis only — pole attachment fees, terms, and conditions to be nondiscriminatory — review, when — attachment during pendency of dispute — revocation, when. —1. As used in this section,\"pole attachment\"means an attachment by an attaching entity, including a video service provider, a telecommunications provider or other communications-related service provider to a pole owned or controlled by a municipal utility or municipality, but not a wireless antenna attachment or an attachment by a wireless communications provider to a pole. As used in this section,\"pole\"means a utility pole which is owned or controlled by a municipal utility or municipality, but shall not include poles that are not associated with the transmission or distribution of electric power, communications, broadband, or video services. A municipal utility or municipality may only deny an attaching entity access to the utility's poles on a nondiscriminatory basis if there is insufficient capacity or for reasons of safety and reliability and if the attaching entity will not resolve the issue. If a municipal utility or municipality does not find any capacity, safety, or reliability issues, such municipal utility or municipality shall issue the attaching entity a permit to attach to the municipal utility's or municipality's poles. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a municipal utility or municipality from requiring an attaching entity to enter into a pole attachment agreement consistent with this section.\n\n2. Notwithstanding sections 67.1830 to 67.1846, any pole attachment fees, terms, and conditions, including those related to the granting or denial of access, demanded by a municipal utility pole owner or controlling authority of a municipality shall be nondiscriminatory, just, and reasonable and shall not be subject to any required franchise authority or government entity permitting, except as provided in this section. A pole attachment rental fee shall be calculated on an annual, per-pole basis. Such rental fee shall be considered nondiscriminatory, just, and reasonable if it is agreed upon by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, based on cost but in no such case shall such fee so calculated be greater than the fee which would apply if it were calculated in accordance with the cable service rate formula referenced in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224(d) as applied by the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, a municipal pole owner may be authorized to exceed the rate of return cost components of the Federal Communications Commission formula referenced in this section if necessary to comply with Article X of the Missouri Constitution. In the event of a dispute between the parties, either party may bring an action for review in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall rule on any such petition for review in an expedited manner by moving the petition to the head of the docket consistent with subsection 2 of this section. Nothing shall deny any party the right to a hearing before the court.\n\n3. Where no pole attachment agreement exists between an attaching entity and the municipal utility pole owner or controlling authority of a municipality, and a dispute between a municipal utility pole owner or controlling authority of a municipality and an attaching entity exclusively concerns the per-pole fee or any requirement or issue not directly related to pole attachments consistent with this section or both, then the attaching entity may proceed with its attachments during the pendency of the dispute under the agreed-upon terms and conditions at a rental rate of no more than as set forth in subsection 2 of this section. The attaching entity shall comply with applicable and reasonable engineering, safety and reliability standards and shall hold the municipal pole owner or controlling authority of the municipality harmless for any liabilities or damages incurred that are caused by the attaching entity.\n\n4. The provisions of this section shall not supersede existing pole attachment agreements established prior to August 28, 2014.\n\n5. Nothing in this section shall be construed as conferring any jurisdiction or authority to the public service commission or any state agency to regulate either the fees, terms, or conditions for pole attachments, or for any state agency to assert any jurisdiction over attachments to poles regulated by 47 U.S.C. Sec. 224.\n\n6. A municipal utility or municipality may, after reasonable written notice and an opportunity to cure, as provided in the applicable pole attachment agreement between a municipal utility or municipality and an attaching entity, revoke a pole attachment permit granted to an attaching entity and require removal of the attachment with or without fee refund for breach of the pole attachment agreement or permit until the breach is cured, but only in the event of a substantial breach of material terms and conditions of the pole attachment agreement or permit. A substantial breach by an attaching entity shall be limited to:\n\n(1) A material violation of a material provision of the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit;\n\n(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit;\n\n(3) A material misrepresentation of fact in the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit application;\n\n(4) A failure to complete work by the date and in accordance with the terms specified in the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the attaching entity's control; or\n\n(5) A failure to correct, within the time and in accordance with the terms specified by the municipal utility or municipality in the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit, work by the attaching entity that does not conform to applicable national safety codes, industry construction standards, or local safety codes that are not more stringent than national safety codes, upon inspection and notification by the municipal utility or municipality of the faulty condition. If the time for correction is not specified in the applicable pole attachment agreement or permit, the time for correction shall be reasonable under the particular circumstances, and in no event less than thirty days.\n\n7. Unless otherwise provided for in an applicable pole attachment agreement, in the event of an imminent threat to public health, life, or safety, a municipal utility or municipality shall, upon notice to the attaching entity, request the attaching entity rearrange, relocate, or remove a pole attachment from a pole or absent action from the attaching entity, have the authority to rearrange, relocate, or remove a pole attachment consistent with industry practices. The attaching entity shall be notified as soon as practicable upon the cessation of the threat to public health, life, or safety, or upon restoration of the attachment by the municipal utility or municipality.\n\n(L. 2013 H.B. 345, A.L. 2014 S.B. 653)",

The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within thirty days of the denial without paying an additional application fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty days. Any subsequent review shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial;\n\n(11) (a) An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of multiple small wireless facilities; provided, however, the denial of one or more small wireless facilities in a consolidated application shall not delay processing of any other small wireless facilities in the same batch; and\n\n(b) An application may include up to twenty separate small wireless facilities, provided that they are for the same or materially same design of small wireless facility being collocated on the same or materially the same type of utility pole or wireless support structure, and geographically proximate. If an authority receives individual applications for approval of more than fifty small wireless facilities or consolidated applications for approval of more than seventy-five small wireless facilities within a fourteen-day period, whether from a single applicant or multiple applicants, the authority may, upon its own request, obtain an automatic thirty-day extension for any additional collocation or replacement or installation application submitted during that fourteen-day period or in the fourteen-day period immediately following the prior fourteen-day period. An authority shall promptly communicate its request to each and any affected applicant. In rendering a decision on an application for multiple small wireless facilities, the authority may approve the application as to certain individual small wireless facilities while denying it as to others based on applicable requirements and standards, including those identified in this section. The authority's denial of any individual small wireless facility or subset of small wireless facilities within an application shall not be a basis to deny the application as a whole;\n\n(12) Installation or collocation for which a permit is granted under this section shall be completed within one year after the permit issuance date unless the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period, or the applicant notifies the authority that the delay is caused by a lack of commercial power or communications transport facilities to the site. Approval of an application authorizes the applicant to:\n\n(a) Undertake the installation or collocation; and\n\n(b) Operate and maintain the small wireless facilities and any associated utility pole covered by the permit for a period of not less than ten years, which shall be renewed for equivalent durations so long as they are in compliance with the criteria set forth in subdivision (9) of this subsection, unless the applicant and the authority agree to an extension term of less than ten years. The provisions of this paragraph shall be subject to the right of the authority to require, upon adequate notice and at the facility owner's own expense, relocation of facilities as may be needed in the interest of public safety and convenience, and the applicant's right to terminate at any time;\n\n(13) An authority shall not institute, either expressly or de facto, a moratorium on filing, receiving, or processing applications or issuing permits or other approvals, if any, for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of utility poles to support small wireless facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an authority may impose a temporary moratorium on applications for small wireless facilities and the collocation thereof for the duration of a federal or state-declared natural disaster plus a reasonable recovery period, or for no more than thirty days in the event of a major and protracted staffing shortage that reduces the number of personnel necessary to receive, review, process, and approve or deny applications for the collocation of small wireless facilities by more than fifty percent;\n\n(14) Nothing in this section precludes an authority from adopting reasonable rules with respect to the removal of abandoned small wireless facilities;\n\n(15) In determining whether sufficient capacity exists to accommodate the attachment of a new small wireless facility, an authority shall grant access subject to a reservation to reclaim such space, when and if needed, to meet the pole owner's core utility purpose or documented authority plan projected at the time of the application pursuant to a bona fide development plan, or if the state highways and transportation commission is the relevant authority and determines, in its sole discretion, that attachment of the small wireless facility will affect the safety of the public using the right-of-way; and\n\n(16) In emergency circumstances that result from a natural disaster or accident, an authority may require the owner or operator of a wireless facility to immediately remove such facility if the wireless facility is obstructing traffic or causing a hazard on the authority's roadway.
