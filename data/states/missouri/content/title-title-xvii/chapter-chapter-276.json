Failure to keep such bond in force is cause for revocation of the license, and the dealer is subject to the penalties provided in this chapter. No dealer may cancel an approved bond without the prior written approval of the director and the director's approval of a substitute bond.\n\n5. A grain dealer filing bonds required under sections 276.401 to 276.582, or regulations promulgated thereunder who is also licensed under chapter 411 shall utilize the same corporate surety for all bonds required to be licensed under chapter 411 and as a grain dealer.\n\n6. Upon written demand of the director for payment, the surety shall either pay over to the director the sum demanded up to the full face amount of the bond, or shall deposit the sum demanded in an interest-bearing escrow account at the highest rate of interest available. When a surety pays the director upon demand, the director shall either interplead the sum in court or hold an administrative hearing for the determination of the liability of the surety, and the validity of claims against the bond, and upon the conclusion thereof, the director shall distribute the bond proceeds accordingly. The determination of the director shall be final, subject to the surety's or a claimant's right to appeal to the circuit court pursuant to the provisions of chapter 536. Refusal or failure of the surety to pay the sum demanded to the director within ten days of receipt of the director's demand letter or the refusal or failure to deposit the sum demanded in an interest-bearing escrow account at the highest rate of interest available, shall be grounds for withdrawal of the surety's license and authorization to conduct business in this state, and grounds for the court to penalize the surety, for refusal to pay or to deposit within the ten days of demand, in the amount of twenty-five percent of the full face amount of the bond, plus interest at the rate of nine percent, or at the rate that the director can establish he would have received had the money been paid or deposited by the surety, whichever rate of interest is higher. In the event that the surety pays as demanded and the director or court determines the surety is not liable, the director shall return to the surety the sum paid to the director plus all accumulated interest, or any pro rata part of the sum, plus interest, as applicable in the event of liability less than the sum demanded. In the event that the surety elects to deposit the demanded sum in an interest-bearing escrow account and the director holds an administrative hearing determining the liability of the surety and the validity of claims, and upon the exhaustion of appeals, if any, the surety immediately shall pay to the director for distribution to claimants the amount for which the surety has been determined to be liable plus accumulated interest on that amount.\n\n7. Every bond filed shall contain a provision that it may not be cancelled by the principal or surety company except upon ninety days' prior notice in writing, by certified mail, to the director at his Jefferson City office. In the case of a surety giving notice of cancellation, a copy of such notice shall be mailed, by certified mail, on the same day to the principal. The cancellation does not affect the liability accrued or which may accrue under such bond before the expiration of the ninety days. The notice shall contain the termination date. In the event such notice procedures are not followed, the bond shall remain in full force and effect until properly cancelled.\n\n8. Whenever the director receives notice from a surety that it intends to cancel the bond of a dealer, the director shall automatically suspend the dealer's license if a new bond is not received by the director within thirty days of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel. If a new bond is not received within sixty days of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the director shall revoke the dealer's license. The director may cause an inspection of the grain dealer at the end of this sixty-day period. Such inspection may include an attempt to identify all possible grain sellers and related claimants of the dealer by advertising for same in local news media.\n\n9. Verbal or written surety bond binders issued by a surety on behalf of a grain dealer for original or replacement bonds are hereby recognized as legally effective in the state of Missouri as if the bond were fully executed when such binders meet the following conditions:\n\n(1) The dealer or principal has paid, or has promised to pay, the surety an agreed upon or tentatively agreed upon premium or other consideration;\n\n(2) The surety provides the department, either in writing or verbally:\n\n(a) A bond number;\n\n(b) The amount of the bond;\n\n(c) The effective date of the bond;\n\n(d) Either verbal or written assurance that the person providing the preceding information has authority to commit the surety. Such binders may be cancelled only in the manner provided in subsection 8 of this section. The director may or may not accept such a binder depending on the particular circumstances involved and consistent with the orderly administration of this chapter.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1627 § 6, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1578, A.L. 1997 H.B. 211)\n\nEffective 4-02-97",

Sections 276.401 to 276.581 and all regulations promulgated hereunder that apply to surety bonds shall also apply to certificates of deposit. Any certificate of deposit submitted in lieu of a surety bond required under sections 276.401 to 276.581 shall be filed with the director as trustee for the benefit of all persons selling grain to the grain dealer. The certificate of deposit will be kept in the custody of the director.\n\n2. A grain dealer may, in lieu of the bond required under this chapter, submit an irrevocable letter of credit, payable to the director for the benefit of claimants, and issued by a federally or state chartered bank. The director may refuse to accept a letter of credit in lieu of the bond required by this chapter if the director finds that the issuing bank is or may become insolvent, or for any other reason may be unable to honor the terms of the letter of credit. The director may require an issuing bank to submit evidence of its financial condition, and the director may seek the cooperation of the division of finance in evaluating the financial condition of an issuing bank. The director shall promulgate all necessary regulations pertaining to certificates of deposit, and irrevocable letters of credit.\n\n3.

Amount of bond — director to establish by rule — formula — minimum and maximum — additional bond because of low net worth or other circumstances — failure to maintain, effect. —1. The total amount of the surety bond required of a dealer licensed pursuant to sections 276.401 to 276.582 shall be established by the director by rule, but in no event shall such bond be less than fifty thousand dollars nor more than six hundred thousand dollars, except as authorized by other provisions of sections 276.401 to 276.582.\n\n2. The formula for determining the amount of bond shall be established by the director by rule and shall be computed at a rate of no less than the principal amount to the nearest one thousand dollars, equal to two percent of the aggregate dollar amount paid by the dealer for grain purchased in the state of Missouri and those states with whom Missouri has entered into contracts or agreements as authorized by section 276.566 during the dealer's last completed fiscal year, or, in the case of a dealer who has been engaged in business as a grain dealer for less than one year or who has not previously engaged in such business, two percent of the estimated aggregate dollar amount to be paid by the dealer for grain purchased in the state of Missouri and those states with whom Missouri has entered into contracts or agreements as authorized by section 276.566 during the applicant's initial fiscal year.\n\n3. Any licensed grain dealer or applicant who has, at any time, a net worth less than the amount required by subsection 7 of section 276.421 shall be required to obtain a surety bond in the amount of one thousand dollars for each one thousand dollars or fraction thereof of the net worth deficiency. Failure to post such additional bond is grounds for refusal to license or the suspension or revocation of a license issued under sections 276.401 to 276.582. This additional bond can be in addition to or greater than or both in addition to and greater than the maximum bond as set by this section.\n\n4. The director may, when the question arises as to a grain dealer's ability to pay for grain purchased, require a grain dealer to post an additional bond in a dollar amount deemed appropriate by the director. Such additional bond can be in addition to or greater than or both in addition to and greater than the maximum bond as set by this section. The director must furnish to the dealer, by certified mail, a written statement of the reasons for requesting additional bond and the reasons for questioning the dealer's ability to pay. Failure to post such additional bond is a ground for modification, suspension or revocation by the director of a license issued under sections 276.401 to 276.582. The determination of insufficiency of a bond and of the amount of the additional bond shall be based upon evidence presented to the director that a dealer:\n\n(1) Is or may be unable to meet his dollar or grain obligations as they become due;\n\n(2) Has acted or is acting in a way which might lead to the impairment of his capital;\n\n(3) As a result of his activity, inactivity, or purchasing and pricing practices and procedures, including, but not limited to, the dealer's deferred pricing or deferred payment practices and procedures, is or may be unable to honor his grain purchase obligations arising out of his dealer business. The amount of the additional bond required under this subsection shall not exceed the amount of the dealer's current loss position. Current loss position shall be the sum of the dealer's current liabilities less current assets or the amount by which he is currently unable to meet the grain purchase obligations arising out of his dealer business.\n\n5. One bond, cumulative as to minimum requirements, may be given where a dealer has multiple licenses; except however, that in computing the amount of the single bond the grain dealer may add together the total purchases of grain of all locations to be covered thereby and use the aggregate total purchases for the fiscal year for the purpose of computing bond. However, this single cumulative bond must be at least equal to fifty thousand dollars per dealer license issued up to the six hundred thousand dollar maximum bond amount specified in subsection 1 of this section. When a grain dealer elects to provide a single bond for a number of licensed locations, the total assets of all the licensed locations shall be subject to liabilities of each individual licensed location.\n\n6. Failure of a grain dealer to provide and file a bond and financial statement and to keep such bond in force shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation, by the director, of a license issued under sections 276.401 to 276.582.\n\n7. A dealer shall be required to post additional surety bond when he surpasses the estimated aggregate dollar amount to be paid for grain purchased as set forth in subsection 2 of this section.

Dealer to pay for grain, when — failure to make payment on demand, director's duties, grounds for modification, suspension or revocation of license — demands, how made. —1. In general, a person licensed as a grain dealer shall make payment of the agreed-upon purchase price to the seller of grain upon delivery or demand of said seller or his authorized agent, unless a written grain purchase contract or valid deferred payment contract shall provide otherwise. However, every person licensed as a grain dealer shall establish and properly document the agreed-upon purchase price of all grain he buys as prescribed by the director or as otherwise provided by law. When a dealer has failed to make payment upon demand of the seller and such failure has come to the attention of the director, the director may request the dealer to make payment. Such request may be made verbally or in writing. The director may require the dealer to make payment with a certified or cashier's check, or in cash. The license may be modified, suspended or revoked if the dealer fails to make timely payment as requested by the director.\n\n2. A person licensed as a class I dealer shall properly document the agreed-upon, between buyer and seller, purchase price of grain, as prescribed by the director, and shall make payment upon demand. However, if no demand for payment is made, a class I dealer has the option of entering the account, as prescribed by the director, onto a formal settlement sheet or paying the seller the agreed upon price. Such entry onto a formal settlement sheet must occur within thirty days of delivery. When an account is so entered onto a formal settlement sheet, payment shall be made the earlier of demand or one hundred eighty days from delivery. If payment is not made at the conclusion of the one hundred eighty day period, a formal written contract as provided for in subsections 8 and 11 of this section shall be executed.\n\n3. A person licensed as a class II dealer shall properly document the agreed-upon, between buyer and seller, purchase price of grain, as prescribed by the director, and shall make payment upon demand. However, if no demand for payment is made, a class II dealer has the option of entering the account, as prescribed by the director, onto a formal settlement sheet or paying the seller the agreed-upon price. Such entry onto a formal settlement sheet must occur within thirty days of delivery. When an account is so entered onto a formal settlement sheet, payment shall be made on demand or within one hundred eighty days from delivery, whichever occurs first. A class II dealer shall not enter into any type of credit sales contract.\n\n4. A person licensed as a class III, IV, V or VI grain dealer shall make payment to the seller within thirty days of delivery or upon demand of the seller or his authorized agent, whichever occurs first. A class III, IV, V, or VI dealer shall not enter into any type of credit sales contract.\n\n5. Nothing contained in sections 276.401 to 276.582 shall be construed to limit or prohibit the right of a seller of grain to make an oral demand for payment from a dealer, provided that the right to recover under the surety bond shall be based only upon written demand to the surety by the seller or by the department on behalf of the claimant.\n\n6. Recovery by a claimant on the bond shall not be his sole or exclusive remedy and shall not bar a civil action based upon rights or obligations arising under the grain purchase contract.\n\n7. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, in the case of valid deferred price contracts the seller of grain shall have no right of recovery under the grain dealer's surety bond. Deferred price contracts shall be in writing, dated, and shall contain a statement informing the seller that the seller is relinquishing title and all rights of ownership in the grain, that the grain dealer is not required to carry bond on the grain for the benefit of the seller, and that the payment for the grain becomes a common claim against the grain dealer. Only a class I grain dealer may enter into deferred price contracts.\n\n8. In the case of deferred payment contracts, a class I grain dealer and a seller of grain may agree that payment be deferred to a future date. The agreement shall be in writing, dated, and shall contain a statement informing the seller that the seller is transferring title to the buyer and that the seller is relinquishing all rights in the grain and that the class I dealer is required to carry bond on the grain for the benefit of the seller for twelve months from the date the contract was entered into, and that after twelve months, payment for the grain becomes a common claim against the dealer. No other class of dealer may enter into deferred payment contracts.\n\n9. In the event the license of a grain dealer is revoked by the director for any reason, all deferred payment agreements executed within the twelve months prior to revocation shall be deemed priced unpaid obligations as of the effective date of the revocation and as such agreements are covered by the grain dealer's bond.\n\n10. In the case of minimum price contracts, a class I grain dealer and a seller of grain may agree upon a minimum price for the grain sold but allow the seller to retain the ability to participate in subsequent price gains or futures market increases, if any. The agreement shall be in writing, dated, and shall contain a statement informing the seller that the seller is transferring title and all rights of ownership in the grain to the buyer, and shall contain entries stating the agreed upon minimum price and explaining how subsequent price gains will be calculated. This agreement shall also contain statements informing the seller that only the payment of the specified minimum price is covered under the dealer's bond for the benefit of the seller, for, and only for, twelve months from the date the contract was entered; and that payment for any subsequent price gains, if any, is not covered by bond. No other class of dealer may enter minimum price contracts.\n\n11. For the purposes of this section, deferred price, deferred payment, and minimum price contracts are not deemed valid unless they contain all the required statements and are signed by both the buyer and seller or their authorized representatives. The director may require any additional information from a grain dealer that he deems necessary to protect the interests of the seller of grain in such transactions. Class II, III, IV, V and VI grain dealers may not use or enter into such contracts with sellers of grain.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1627 § 13, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1578, A.L. 1987 H.B. 751, A.L. 1997 H.B. 211)\n\nEffective 4-02-97",

Upon receipt of the director's verified petition setting forth the circumstances of the dealer's failure to comply with sections 276.401 to 276.582, and further stating reasons why immediate possession by the director or his authorized agent is necessary for the protection of grain sellers or sureties, the court is authorized to issue an ex parte order authorizing the director or his authorized agent to take immediate possession for the purposes stated in this section. A copy of the petition and order shall be sent to the dealer. If appropriate, the court may order the director's taking possession of only grain-related assets and not the entire business of the dealer. Such order may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The director locking down and securing, by padlocks or other appropriate means, the grain storage bins, scales, offices, equipment and rolling stock of the dealer;\n\n(2) Removing and excluding the dealer, or any and all of the dealer's employees, from the facility;\n\n(3) Prohibiting the dealer from engaging in any grain-related business transactions whatever during the director's possession of the grain-related assets of the dealer's business;\n\n(4) Authorizing all financial institutions to place all business accounts of the dealer under the director's authority and to freeze all transactions involving such accounts except to honor outstanding checks written previous to the issuance of the court's order. If it appears that the dealer has conducted, in part, his grain dealer business through the use of personal accounts as opposed to business accounts, or intermingled two or more such accounts, the court may authorize the applicable financial institutions to place such personal accounts, as well as the business accounts, under the authority of the director in order to allow the director to accurately determine the extent of all grain-related obligations incurred by the dealer, the correct status of same and the dealer's resources to pay his grain-related obligations;\n\n(5) Authorizing the director to redeliver or sell depositor or dealer-owned grain, as appropriate in the circumstances and setting forth the conditions for doing such;\n\n(6) Authorizing the director to deposit all grain-related assets and proceeds therefrom in an interest-bearing escrow account to be disbursed only upon orders of the court;\n\n(7) Directing the dealer to provide the director with all grain-related business documents which come into his possession subsequent to the director's possession of the grain-related assets, as well as any other grain-related documents which the dealer may have knowledge of and which are not at the dealer's facility.\n\n3. At any time within ten days after the director or his authorized agent takes possession, the dealer may file with the court a response to the petition of the director stating reasons why the director or his authorized agent should not be allowed to retain possession. The court shall set the matter for hearing on a date not more than fifteen days from the date of the filing of the dealer's response. The order placing the director or his authorized agent in possession shall not be stayed nor set aside until such time as the court, after hearing, determines that possession should be restored to the dealer.\n\n4. Upon taking possession, the director shall give written notice of his action to the surety on the bond of the dealer and may notify all known sellers as shown by the dealer's records.\n\n5. The director or his authorized agent shall retain possession obtained under this section until such time as the dealer or the surety on the bond shall have satisfied the claims of all sellers, or until such time as the director or his authorized agent is ordered by the court to surrender possession. At no time while the director or his authorized agent is in possession of a dealer's business, as authorized by this section, shall the director, or his authorized agent be required to operate the dealer's business; nor shall the director or his authorized agent be liable for any claims which have arisen or could arise from the nonoperation of the dealer's business.\n\n6.

All necessary expenses incurred by the director, his authorized agents or any receiver appointed under this section, in carrying out the provisions of this section may be recovered from the dealer in a separate civil action brought by the director in the circuit court or as part of the seizure or receivership action filed under this section. If the director or any of his authorized agents seize and take possession of the grain, records or property at the dealer's facility, the dealer may be assessed and shall pay as part of the necessary expenses incurred a fee of one hundred dollars per person for each day or part thereof that each such person performs such activities.

If a grain dealer has been charged, and has paid, a penalty fee for operating without a license as set forth in section 276.411, the grain dealer may not be charged with a class B misdemeanor for operating without a license for the time period covered by the penalty fee;\n\n(2) Violating any of the provisions of sections 276.401 to 276.581;\n\n(3) Impeding, hindering, obstructing, or otherwise preventing or attempting to prevent the director, the director's designated representative, employees, or any auditor in the performance of his or her duty in connection with sections 276.401 to 276.581 or the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;\n\n(4) On the part of any person, refusing to permit inspection of his or her premises, books, accounts or records as provided in sections 276.401 to 276.581.\n\n2. In case of a continuing violation, each day a violation occurs constitutes a separate and distinct offense.\n\n3. It shall be the duty of the attorney general or each prosecuting attorney to whom any violation of sections 276.401 to 276.581 is reported to cause appropriate proceedings under this section to be instituted and prosecuted in a court of competent jurisdiction without delay. Before a violation is reported for prosecution, the director may give the grain dealer an opportunity to present his or her views at an informal hearing. In the event the director determines that a prosecutor to whom a violation has been reported has failed to institute appropriate proceedings, the director may make a written report of the failure to institute proceedings to the attorney general. The attorney general may investigate the circumstances which resulted in the report. If the attorney general determines additional proceedings are appropriate, he or she shall cause such proceedings to be instituted. When the attorney general causes such a proceeding to be instituted, he or she shall have all the powers and rights of the office of the prosecuting attorney to whom the violation was originally reported. Such powers and rights are restricted to the prosecution of the specific case reported.\n\n4. A grain dealer licensed or required to be licensed under sections 276.401 to 276.581, or any officer, agent, or servant of such grain dealer who files false records, scale tickets, financial papers or accounts with the director, or who withholds records, scale tickets, financial papers or accounts from the director, or who alters records, scale tickets, financial papers or accounts in order to conceal amounts owed to sellers of grain or actual amounts of grain received and paid or not paid for or for the purpose of in any way misleading department auditors and officials is, upon conviction, guilty of a class D felony.\n\n5. Any duly authorized officer or employee appointed under the provisions of sections 276.401 to 276.581 who neglects his or her duty, or who knowingly or carelessly inspects, grades, tests, or weighs any grain improperly, conducts an inspection improperly, intentionally falsifies any inspection report, or intentionally gives false information, or who accepts any money or other valuable consideration, directly or indirectly, for any neglect of duty as such duly authorized officer or employee in the performance of his or her duties as such officer or employee is deemed guilty of a class B misdemeanor.\n\n(L. 1980 H.B. 1627 § 27, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1578, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491)\n\nEffective 1-01-17",
