The director shall not issue a certified commercial applicator's license until the applicant or the employer of the applicant has furnished evidence of financial responsibility with the director consisting either of a surety bond or a liability insurance policy or certification thereof, protecting persons who may suffer legal damages as a result of pesticide use by the applicant; except that, such surety bond or liability insurance policy need not apply to damages or injury to crops, plants or land being worked upon by the applicant. Following the receipt of the initial license, the certified commercial applicator shall not be required to furnish evidence of financial responsibility to the department for the purpose of license renewal unless upon request. Annual renewals for surety bonds or liability insurance shall be maintained at the business location from which the certified commercial applicator is licensed. Valid surety bonds or liability insurance certificates shall be available for inspection by the director at a reasonable time during regular business hours or, upon a request in writing, the director shall be furnished a copy of the surety bond or liability insurance certificate within ten days of receipt of the request.\n\n2. The amount of the surety bond or liability insurance required by this section shall be not less than fifty thousand dollars for each occurrence. Such surety bond or liability insurance shall be maintained at not less than that sum at all times during the licensed period. The director shall be notified by the surety or insurer within twenty days prior to any cancellation or reduction of the surety bond or liability insurance. If the surety bond or liability insurance policy which provides the financial responsibility for the certified commercial applicator is provided by the employer of the certified commercial applicator, the employer of the certified commercial applicator shall immediately notify the director upon the termination of the employment of the certified commercial applicator or when a condition exists under which the certified commercial applicator is no longer provided bond or insurance coverage by the employer. The certified commercial applicator shall then immediately execute and submit to the director a surety bond or an insurance policy to cover the financial responsibility requirements of this section and the certified commercial applicator or the applicator's employer shall maintain the surety bond or liability insurance certificate at the business location from which the certified commercial applicator is licensed. The director may accept a liability insurance policy or surety bond in the proper sum which has a deductible clause in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars; except that, if the bond- or policyholder has not satisfied the requirement of the deductible amount in any prior legal claim, such deductible clause shall not be accepted by the director unless the bond- or policyholder executes and maintains a surety bond or liability insurance which shall satisfy the amount of the deductible as to all claims that may arise in the bond- or policyholder's application of pesticides.\n\n3. If the surety becomes unsatisfactory, the commercial applicator license shall expire and become invalid and the bond- or policyholder shall immediately execute and submit to the director a new bond or insurance policy and maintain the surety bond or liability insurance certificate at the business location from which the certified commercial applicator is licensed, and if the bond- or policyholder fails to do so, the director shall cancel the bond- or policyholder's license, or deny the license of an applicant, and give the bond- or policyholder notice of cancellation or denial, and it shall be unlawful thereafter for the applicant to engage in the business of using pesticides until the bond or insurance is brought into compliance with the requirements of subsection 1 of this section.

Registration of pesticides — renewal — fees — powers of director — cancellation of registration on notice and hearing — experimental use permit issued when — revocation. —1. Every pesticide which is distributed, sold, offered for sale or held for sale within this state, or which is delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state through any point outside of this state, shall be registered in the office of the director, and the registration shall be renewed annually.\n\n2. The registrant shall file with the director a statement including:\n\n(1) The name and address of the registrant and the name and address of the person whose name will appear on the label, if other than the registrant;\n\n(2) The name of the pesticide;\n\n(3) Classification of the pesticide; and\n\n(4) A complete copy of the labeling accompanying the pesticide and a statement of all claims to be made for it, including directions for use.\n\n3. The registrant shall pay an annual fee of two hundred dollars for each product registered in any calendar year or part thereof. The fee shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the agriculture protection fund created in section 261.200 to be used solely to administer the pest and pesticide programs of the department of agriculture. The director may deposit up to seven percent of the fee in the pesticide education fund under section 281.265. If the funding exceeds the reasonable costs to administer the programs as set forth herein, the department of agriculture shall reduce fees for all registrants if the fees derived exceed the reasonable cost of administering the pest and pesticide programs of the department of agriculture. All such registrations shall expire on December thirty-first of any one year, unless sooner cancelled. A registration for a special local need pursuant to subsection 6 of this section, which is disapproved by the federal government, shall expire on the effective date of the disapproval.\n\n4. Any registration approved by the director and in effect on the thirty-first day of December for which a renewal application has been made and the proper fee paid shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the director notifies the applicant that the registration has been renewed, or otherwise denied, in accord with the provisions of subsection 9 of this section. Forms for reregistration shall be mailed to registrants at least ninety days prior to the expiration date.\n\n5. If the renewal of a pesticide registration is not filed prior to January first of any one year, an additional fee of fifty dollars shall be assessed and added to the original fee and shall be paid by the applicant before the registration renewal for that pesticide shall be issued; provided, that, such additional fee shall not apply if the applicant furnishes an affidavit certifying that he or she did not distribute such unregistered pesticide during the period of nonregistration. The payment of such additional fee is not a bar to any prosecution for doing business without proper registry. The fee shall be credited to the agriculture protection fund created under section 261.200 to be used solely to administer the pest and pesticide programs of the department of agriculture. If the funding exceeds the reasonable cost to administer the programs as set forth herein, the department of agriculture shall reduce fees for all registrants if the fees derived exceed the reasonable cost of administering the pest and pesticide programs of the department of agriculture.\n\n6. Provided the state complies with requirements of the federal government to register pesticides to meet special local needs, the director shall require that registrants comply with sections 281.210 to 281.310 and pertinent federal laws and regulations. Where two or more pesticides meet the requirements of this subsection, one shall not be registered in preference to the other.\n\n7. The director may require the submission of the complete formula of any pesticide to approve or deny product registration. If it appears to the director that the composition and efficacy of the pesticide is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it and if the pesticide and its labeling and other material required to be submitted comply with the requirements of sections 281.210 to 281.310, he or she shall register the pesticide.\n\n8. Provided the state is authorized to issue experimental use permits, the director may:\n\n(1) Issue an experimental use permit to any person applying for an experimental use permit if he or she determines that the applicant needs such permit in order to accumulate information necessary to register a pesticide under sections 281.210 to 281.310. An application for an experimental use permit may be filed at the time of or before or after an application for registration is filed;\n\n(2) Prescribe terms, conditions, and period of time for the experimental permit which shall be under the supervision of the director;\n\n(3) Revoke any experimental permit, at any time, if he or she finds that its terms or conditions are being violated, or that its terms and conditions are inadequate to avoid unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.\n\n9. If it does not appear to the director that the pesticide is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it or if the pesticide and its labeling and other material required to be submitted do not comply with the provisions of sections 281.210 to 281.310 or with federal laws, he or she shall notify the registrant of the manner in which the pesticide, labeling, or other material required to be submitted fail to comply with sections 281.210 to 281.310 or with federal laws so as to afford the registrant an opportunity to make the necessary corrections. If, upon receipt of such notice, the registrant insists that such corrections are not necessary and requests in writing that the pesticide be registered or, in the case of a pesticide that is already registered, that it not be cancelled, the director, within ninety days, shall hold a public hearing to determine if the pesticide in question should be registered or cancelled. If, after such hearing, it is determined that the pesticide should not be registered or that its registration should be cancelled, the director may refuse registration or cancel an existing registration until the required label changes are accomplished. If the pesticide is shown to be in compliance with sections 281.210 to 281.310 and federal laws, the pesticide will be registered. Any appeals resulting from administrative decisions by the director will be taken in accordance with sections 536.100 to 536.140.\n\n10. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 281.210 to 281.310, registration is not required in the case of a pesticide shipped from one plant or warehouse within this state to another plant or warehouse within this state when such plants are operated by the same persons.\n\n11. The director shall not make any lack of essentiality a criterion for denying registration of a pesticide except where none of the labeled uses are present in the state. Where two or more pesticides meet the requirements of sections 281.210 to 281.310, one shall not be registered in preference to the other.\n\n12. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the director may allow a reasonable period of time for the retailer to dispose of existing stocks of pesticides after the manufacturer or distributor has ceased to register the product with the state. The method of disposal shall be determined by the director.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 26 § 4, A.L. 1959 H.B. 221, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1514 § 263.320, A.L. 2008 S.B. 931, A.L. 2010 S.B. 795, A.L. 2019 S.B. 133)",

The director may, within his discretion and appropriations, report or cause to be reported the results of the examinations, analyses and tests of any pesticides made under the provisions of sections 281.210 to 281.310, together with any other information which serves to carry out the proper purposes of sections 281.210 to 281.310; provided, that, if the director reports the violations of any registrant or person he shall report the violations of all registrants and persons over the same period of time.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 26 § 6, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1514 § 263.340)",

Any pesticide that is distributed, sold, offered for sale, or held for sale within this state, or which is delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state through any point outside this state, shall be liable to be proceeded against in any circuit court in any county of this state where it may be found for purposes of confiscation and condemnation:\n\n(1) If it is adultered or misbranded;\n\n(2) If it has not been registered under the provisions of sections 281.210 to 281.310; or\n\n(3) If it fails to bear on its label the information required by sections 281.210 to 281.310.\n\n2. If the pesticide is condemned as the result of court action, it shall, after entry of decree, be disposed of by destruction, or sale, as the court may direct, and the proceeds, if such pesticide is sold, less legal costs, shall be paid to the state treasurer; provided, that, the pesticide shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of sections 281.210 to 281.310; and provided further, that upon payment of costs of execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon the promise that the pesticide shall not be disposed of unlawfully, the court may direct that such pesticide be delivered to the owner thereof for relabeling or reprocessing, as the case may be.\n\n3. When the director has reasonable cause to believe any pesticide is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of sections 281.210 to 281.310, or of any of the prescribed rules promulgated pursuant to sections 281.210 to 281.310, he may issue and enforce a written or printed \"stop sale, use or removal\" order, warning the owner or custodian of any such pesticide or device not to dispose of the pesticide or device in any manner until written permission is given by the director or the court. If the owner or custodian is not available for service of the order upon him, the director may attach the order to the pesticide or device and notify the owner or custodian and the registrant. The director shall release the pesticide so withdrawn when such provisions and rules have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within thirty days, the director may begin or, upon request of the distributor or registrant, shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.\n\n4. When a decree of condemnation is entered against the pesticide, court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the pesticide.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 26 § 9, A.L. 1978 H.B. 1634, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1514 §§ 263.350, 263.360)",
