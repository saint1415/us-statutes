The inspection may include the verification of only such records, and production and control procedures as may be necessary to determine compliance with sections 266.152 to 266.220 and the good manufacturing practice regulations established pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 266.180.\n\n2.

If the officer or employee making such inspection of a factory, warehouse, or other establishment has obtained a sample in the course of the inspection, upon completion of the inspection and prior to leaving the premises such officer or employee shall give to the owner, operator, or agent in charge a receipt describing the samples obtained.\n\n4. If the owner of any factory, warehouse, or establishment described in subsection 1 of this section, or such owner's agent, refuses to admit the director or the director's agent to inspect in accordance with subsections 1 and 2 of this section, the director is authorized to obtain from any state court a warrant directing such owner or such owner's agent to submit the premises described in such warrant to inspection.\n\n5.
