All sewage, drainage, or waste water must first pass through a septic tank or a filter bed or covered settling pool, that will destroy all infection therein before passing therefrom and must not thereafter, at any time, empty or pass into any body of water, or any stream other than a running stream, or if emptying upon the ground, on the premises of said plant, it must be absorbed by the soil and not be allowed to collect in open pools, or in any other manner so as to create a public nuisance.\n\n(2) All such plants must be properly equipped and operated with steel tanks, enclosed dryers and cold water condensers, and all bodies shall be reduced only by approved plants, except in emergencies, where burning may be permitted under regulations prescribed therefor by the state veterinarian.\n\n(3) All tanks shall be airtight, except proper escapes for live steam, passing through the tanks during cooking, which steam shall be condensed by use of cold water condensers. All such equipment shall be so constructed and maintained as to prevent any avoidable escape of odors into the air.\n\n(4) If a method of dry rendering is used, the heads and discharge doors of the vessels shall be of a type using gaskets, with the doors drawn tight with bolts against such gaskets, and with packing boxes around the agitator shafts, and with vent for drawing off condensation, so constructed that the discharge shall be condensed by the use of cold water condensers of sufficient capacity, and with all thereof and every other part and opening in such equipment so constructed and maintained that there will be no avoidable escape of odors into the air.\n\n(5) All skinning and dismembering of bodies shall be done within such building and in such manner and shall be so kept therein that no unnecessary annoyance shall be caused other persons by the conditions or unsightly appearance of such bodies or any parts and contents thereof; and all such bodies and all parts and contents thereof, shall be disposed of within twenty-four hours after delivery to such plant, by some method herein specified; except where rendered impossible by accident or other casualty preventing the operation of the plant, or except where some epidemic or act of God had caused more bodies to be accumulated than can be reasonably disposed of within such period of time by the continuous operation of the plant; in any of which events the plant shall be placed in operation as soon as possible and shall be operated continuously until all bodies are disposed of.\n\n(6) In the event any bodies, or parts thereof, are disposed of at such plant at any time by burning, the place and equipment used therefor shall be so located, constructed, arranged, maintained and operated that no avoidable odors will escape into the air; and all portions of such bodies not so entirely consumed, or that may be otherwise left undisposed of, shall be buried, as herein provided.\n\n(7) In the event any bodies, or parts of bodies, are disposed of at said plant by burying the same, this shall be done in the same manner and period of time after receiving the same as is provided in this chapter for such burial by the owner or person controlling such bodies prior to disposition thereof to any such plant.\n\n(8) Such disposal plant shall be so situated, constructed and maintained and all operations therein so conducted at all times as not to create and continue unnecessarily a public nuisance.\n\n(L. 1941 p. 290 § 14493o)",
