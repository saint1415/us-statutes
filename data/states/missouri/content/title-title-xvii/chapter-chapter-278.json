The state soil and water districts commission shall be composed of four ex officio members and six farmer members. The six farmer members shall be appointed by the governor of Missouri with the advice and consent of the senate. Three of the farmer members shall reside in the portion of this state which is north of the Missouri River and three of the farmer members shall reside in the portion of this state which is south of the Missouri River. The membership shall be geographically dispersed with no more than one of the farmer members appointed from a state senatorial district. Not more than four of the farmer members shall be from the same political party. The ex officio members shall be the director of the department of natural resources, the director of the department of agriculture, the director of the department of conservation, and the dean of the college of agriculture of the University of Missouri. Each of the six farmer members shall be holding legal title to a farm, and shall be earning at least the principal part of the member's livelihood from a farm, all at the time of appointment to the commission. The farmer members shall each be appointed for a period of three years. All members of the commission serving as of June 27, 2000, may continue to serve the unexpired portion of the member's current term. There is no limitation on the number of terms that any of the farmer members appointed by the governor may serve. If any farmer member vacates his or her term for any reason prior to the expiration of such term, the governor may appoint a farmer member to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. Each member of the commission shall continue to serve until the member's successor has been duly appointed and qualified.\n\n3. The state soil and water districts commission may call upon the attorney general of the state for such legal services as it may require.\n\n4. At its first meeting in each calendar year, the state soil and water districts commission shall select from its current members a chairman and a vice chairman. The ex officio members shall not have the power to vote on any matter before the commission. A quorum shall consist of four farmer members. For the determination of any matter within the commission's authority, at a meeting comprised of four farmer members, a concurrence of three shall be required. No business of the commission shall be executed in absence of a quorum. Each farmer member of the soil and water commission shall be entitled to expenses, including travel expenses, necessarily incurred in the discharge of his or her duties as a member of this commission.

In addition to the authority and duty herein assigned to the state soil and water districts commission, it shall have the following authority and duty:\n\n(1) To encourage the formation of soil and water conservation districts in areas where their establishment seems necessary and their administration seems feasible;\n\n(2) To formulate and fix the rules and procedures for fair and impartial referendums on the establishing or disestablishment of soil and water districts and for fair and impartial selection of soil and water district supervisors;\n\n(3) To receive petitions for the establishing of soil and water conservation districts as provided in section 278.100; to determine the validity of these petitions; to conduct hearings upon the subject of these petitions; to determine whether the establishment of a soil and water district as petitioned would be effective in the saving of soil and water within the proposed area, and whether a soil and water district if established could be feasibly administered; and, upon reaching a favorable conclusion on these matters, to call for a referendum on the establishing of the soil and water district as petitioned;\n\n(4) To advise any soil and water conservation district in developing its program for saving the soil and water in order that such district may become eligible for any form of aid from state or federal sources;\n\n(5) Subject to district allocations by the commission and other resources, to provide training, programs and other assistance to soil and water conservation districts to identify programs that respond to the character of the districts' needs;\n\n(6) To obtain or accept the cooperation and financial, technical or material assistance of the United States or any of its agencies, and of this state or any of its agencies, for the work of such soil and water districts;\n\n(7) To enter into agreements with the United States or any of its agencies on policies and general programs for the saving of Missouri soil and water by the extension of federal aid to any soil and water conservation district; to advise any soil and water conservation district; to advise any soil and water conservation district on the amount or kind of federal aid needed for the effective saving of soil and water in that district; to determine within the limits of available funds or other resources the amount or kind of state aid to be used for saving of soil and water in any soil and water conservation district; and to determine the withholding of state aid of any amount or kind from any soil and water conservation district that has failed to follow the policies of the state soil and water districts commission in any matter under the provisions of sections 278.060 to 278.300;\n\n(8) To give such other proper assistance as the soil and water commission may judge to be useful to any soil and water district in the saving of soil and water in that district;\n\n(9) To promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectively administer a state-funded soil and water conservation cost-share program. Any rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of sections 278.060 to 278.300 shall become effective only if it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of chapter 536.\n\n6. Unless prohibited by any federal or state law, the commission may grant individual variances to any rule or regulation promulgated thereto, upon presentation of adequate proof, that compliance with sections 278.070 to 278.300, or any rule or regulation, standard, requirement, limitation or order of the commission will have an arbitrary and unreasonable impact on landowners participating in soil and water conservation eligible practices. The commission shall promulgate such rules, regulations and administrative guidelines as necessary to effectively administer this section.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 839 § 3, A.L. 1961 p. 31, A.L. 1980 S.B. 612, A.L. 1986 H.B. 1172, A.L. 1995 S.B. 3, S.B. 65, A.L. 2000 S.B. 741, A.L. 2001 S.B. 462)",

If from this hearing it shall appear to the soil and water commission that there is a general desire for establishing as a soil and water district the county or the specified township or townships, the commission shall without delay determine by a survey of the conditions of farm land in the county or specified township or townships whether the establishment of that area as a soil and water conservation district is actually necessary and administratively feasible. Upon reaching a favorable conclusion on these matters, the commission shall call for and conduct, or cause to be conducted, a referendum by ballot of land representatives within that area, on the question of establishing the county or the specified township or townships as a soil and water conservation district.\n\n2. If a majority of all land representatives voting in this referendum, do vote in favor of this establishment, and if in the judgment of the soil and water commission the total number of votes cast does amount to a substantial expression of opinion, the soil and water commission shall at once declare the county or township, or townships thereof, as specified by the referendum, to be established as a soil and water conservation district; but if these provisions are not met, the soil and water commission shall at once declare the question of establishment to have been lost, although another referendum on this question may be called by the soil and water commission for this area at any time after two years from the date of this declaration, provided the commission meanwhile has received evidence of a more general desire for the establishment of a soil and water district for this area. Subsequent to the establishment of a township or townships as a soil and water district any other township or townships in the same county may be added to this soil and water district by the procedure used for the first establishment.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 839 § 4, A.L. 1961 p. 31)",

The state soil and water districts commission upon declaring the establishment of a soil and water district as provided in section 278.100 shall proceed to arrange in the following manner for the establishment of a board of soil and water district supervisors to act as a local governing body for such soil and water district. This board shall consist of five members, as follows: Ex officio, the county agricultural extension agent; and four land representatives, resident taxpaying citizens within that soil and water district for a period of two years next preceding such election and elected by the majority vote of land representatives under rules and procedures formulated by the soil and water commission, but the date of this election shall not fall upon the date of any regular political election held in that county.\n\n2. The term of office of the ex officio member shall be coincident with his term in the office from which he shall be serving on the supervisory board. The four elected members shall each serve for four years. At the expiration of the terms of members of a supervisory board in a district organized prior to October 13, 1961, and at the first election in a district organized after October 13, 1961, two members shall be elected for terms of two years and two for terms of four years; thereafter all members shall be elected for terms of four years. In case of the death, removal of residence from the county, or resignation from office of any elected member, his successor to the unexpired term shall be appointed by the state soil and water districts commission and such appointee shall be a resident land representative of that county. A soil and water supervisor may succeed himself by reelection in this office.\n\n3. A majority of the board of soil and water supervisors shall constitute a quorum but the concurrence of a majority of the whole board shall be required for the determination of any matter within their duties. The board of soil and water supervisors shall elect a chairman from among themselves, and the county agricultural extension agent shall be secretary of the board.\n\n4. A soil and water supervisor shall receive no compensation for his services, but he shall be entitled to expenses, including travel expense, necessarily incurred in the discharge of his duties as a member of this board. The board of soil and water supervisors may employ within the limits of available funds such assistants as they may require in the performance of their duties and shall determine the qualifications, compensation and duties of such employees.\n\n5. The board of soil and water supervisors shall submit to the state soil and water districts commission for its approval copies of such rules, regulations, forms and other documents as this board shall contemplate using in pursuance of their duties, and such other information concerning their activities as the soil and water commission may require in the performance of its own duties under this law.\n\n6. The board of soil and water supervisors shall provide for the execution of surety bonds for all officers and employees who shall be entrusted with funds or property; shall keep a full and accurate record of all their proceedings and of all their resolutions and regulations issued or adopted; and shall present to the soil and water commission, for approval, a statement of annual audit of all the accounts of receipts and disbursements by the board.\n\n7. The board of soil and water supervisors may invite the legislative body of any municipality or county located near the soil and water district to designate a representative to advise and consult with the soil and water supervisors of the district on all questions of program and policy which may affect the property, water supply, or other interests of such municipality or county.\n\n8. The board of soil and water supervisors will assist the soil and water districts commission in the administration of a state soil and water conservation cost-share program. It may require landowner receiving state cost-share funds to enter into recordable agreements stipulating that:\n\n(1) If a cost-shared project or practice is altered, modified or removed so as to lessen its effectiveness for a period of ten years or the expected life of the project, whichever is less, the landowner, or his heirs, assignees, or other transferees, shall refund to the program any state money used for the project or practice; and\n\n(2) The landowner agrees to maintain in good order the projects and practices cost-shared by the program, except in such case as the maintenance would create undue hardship upon the landowner. In this instance, the soil and water district commission may require easements providing for right of access for the maintenance of said projects or practices.\n\n(L. 1943 p. 839 § 5, A.L. 1961 p. 31, A.L. 1980 S.B. 612)",

Projects, how financed — special assessment appraisers, duties, compensation — assessment resolution, hearings — election — bonds — special levy. —1. When a plan of work is approved the*trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall then by resolution propose that the cost of all works of improvement contemplated in the plan be paid either by a general levy against all real estate in the watershed district, subject to the limitations of section 278.250, or that such cost be paid by special assessment against lands within the watershed district to be benefitted by the installation of the proposed works of improvement, or that such cost be paid by both such general levy and special assessment stating the portion to be paid by each method.\n\n2. If the resolution of financing provides that all or any part of the cost of the works of improvement is to be paid by special assessment of benefits the trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall appoint three appraisers, who shall be residents of the state of Missouri, and who shall not be landowners in such watershed district, who shall recommend apportionment of the special assessment to the tracts of land which will receive benefits from the installation of the works of improvement proposed in the plan of work. The appraisers shall have access to all available engineering reports and data pertaining to the works contemplated and may request additional legal counsel or engineering data from a registered professional engineer as found necessary to carry out their duties.\n\n3. The appraisers shall proceed to view the premises and determine the value of all land or other property within or without the watershed district, to be acquired and used for rights-of-way or other works set out in the plan of work; they shall assess the amount of benefits, and the amount of damage if any, that will accrue to each governmental lot, forty-acre tract or other subdivision of land according to ownership, railroad and other rights-of-way, railroad roadways, and other property from carrying out and putting into effect the plan of work heretofore adopted, and shall make written reports of their findings to the trustees of the watershed district. Each appraiser so appointed shall be paid for his or her services and necessary expenses.\n\n4. Upon receiving the report from the appraisers, the trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall prepare a resolution which shall contain a list of the tracts of land found to be benefitted and the amount of assessment to be levied against each such tract, except that no such assessment against any tract of land shall exceed the estimated benefits to such land by such project. Such tracts of land shall be legally described and the names of the owners thereof shall be set forth beside the description of each tract so listed. After adopting such resolution the trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall fix a time and place for hearing any complaint that may be made as to the benefit to any tract of land appraised, notice of which hearing shall be given by the secretary by publication pursuant to section 278.190. The board of**trustees at the hearing may alter the benefits to any tract if, in its judgment, the same has been appraised too high or too low. The hearing shall be conducted in the manner set forth in section 278.200. The trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall immediately after the hearing pass a resolution fixing the benefit assessment as to each tract of land.\n\n5. After the resolution fixing the benefit assessment has been adopted the trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall submit the proposal for collection of such assessed benefits to the owners of the lands so assessed for approval and if bonds are to be issued the amount of the issue so proposed, the rate of interest, and the amount of any necessary tax levy in excess of the amount authorized in section 278.250. If two-thirds of the owners of such lands voting favor the proposal as submitted, it shall be adopted. The provisions of sections 278.190 to 278.210 as to notice and procedure shall apply to the referendum held pursuant to this section.\n\n6. The trustees of the watershed district, pursuant to section 278.240, shall make the necessary general levy against all real estate in the watershed district and the special assessment against lands within the watershed district to be benefitted by the improvement and shall certify the rate of levy and the amount of the special assessment to the county commission of the county or counties in which the watershed district is located with directions that at the time and in the same manner required by law for the levy of taxes for county purposes the county commission shall levy a tax at the rate so fixed and determined upon the assessed valuation of all real estate within the watershed district and shall levy the amount of the special assessment, in addition to such other taxes as are levied by the county commission.\n\n7.

After a watershed district has been organized for more than five years and that watershed district does not have any outstanding bonds, has not constructed or contracted to construct any works of improvement, nor incurred any continuing obligations for maintenance and operation of any works of improvement or if any works of improvement have been constructed, if there are no bonds outstanding, and an agency of the United States government or the state of Missouri or a county or municipal corporation of this state has made arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary of Agriculture and the state soil and water districts commission to assume responsibility for operating and maintaining such improvement, not less than fifty percent of the landowners of the watershed district may petition the governing body of the watershed district to call for and conduct a referendum upon the disestablishment of the watershed district. If sixty-five percent of the landowners voting in referendum do vote in favor of the disestablishment of the watershed district, the watershed district board shall declare the watershed district to be disestablished; however, prior to any such declaration the watershed district board shall pay or make arrangements to pay any outstanding indebtedness. The provisions of sections 278.190, 278.200 and 278.210 as to notice, qualification of voters and manner of holding the referendum in organizing a watershed district to the extent practicable shall apply to the referendum held pursuant to this section.\n\n2.
