If a national referendum among beef producers passes and a federal assessment on beef producers is adopted pursuant to federal law, no state fees shall be collected under the provisions of this chapter, in excess of a commensurate amount credited against the obligation to pay any such federal assessment. Upon adoption of the federal assessment, beef shall be exempt from the refund provision of section 275.360.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this section to the contrary, a beef commodity council may only collect state fees if a referendum is approved on or after August 28, 2015, in the manner provided under the provisions of subsections 3 to 12 of this section.\n\n3. A beef commodity council established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may submit to the director a petition approved by a two-thirds vote of the council or signed by twenty-five percent of Missouri beef producers to impose or modify a Missouri beef checkoff fee upon beef producers. Any petition submitted to establish or modify a Missouri beef checkoff fee, and the referendum to follow, shall specify the amount and manner of collection of the fee to be assessed. In no case shall the Missouri beef checkoff fee exceed the amount of the federal assessment on beef.

The director shall determine the sufficiency of the petition within twenty-one days after it is submitted to him or her and shall publish notice of the public hearing and registration requirements giving at least ten days' notice prior to public hearing and thirty days' notice to register prior to the referendum.\n\n5. If a majority of the votes cast are in favor of adoption, and if those producers voting in favor of adoption represent a majority of the production of all registered producers casting votes, the petition is adopted.\n\n6. If the required percentage by number and by production of those voting is in favor of the adoption of the proposal in the petition, the director shall declare the proposal to be adopted.\n\n7. A proposal to change the amount of the fee to be collected or to make other changes may be made by a two-thirds vote of the council or by petition of twenty-five percent of the commodity producers.

The department shall keep and account for the state and federal assessments separately. State fees collected pursuant to this section shall be subject to the refund provision provided under section 275.360.\n\n11. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 275.350 to the contrary, fees imposed under this section shall be collected and remitted to the Missouri Beef Industry Council, which shall deposit such fees in a separate account from all other funds. Funds derived from the fees established under this section shall only be used to research, market, educate, and promote beef products and production.\n\n12.
