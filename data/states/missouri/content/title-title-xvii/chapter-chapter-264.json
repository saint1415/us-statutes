Inspection of bees for bee diseases or pests shall be made by the director or an authorized inspector upon the request of any beekeeper, directed to the office of the director, for inspection of bees owned or managed by that beekeeper. A fee shall be charged which is sufficient to cover the cost of the inspection plus the mileage of the inspector at the rate then authorized by the commissioner of administration for reimbursement of expenses of state employees. Fees shall be paid by the owner of the bees at the time of inspection and are not contingent upon certification.\n\n2. The director, by request or suspicion of disease or pests, may inspect or cause to be inspected any apiary or hive. For purposes of inspection, and only when the director has probable cause to believe that the bees of the owner to be inspected are diseased or infested with pests, the director or any authorized inspector shall, after written notice to the owner stating the reasons for such inspection, have free access to all apiaries, buildings or places where bees or beekeeping equipment are kept or stored, and shall have authority to open and examine all beekeeping equipment wherein such bees or honey are kept and stored. Once written notice of inspection has been given to an owner as provided in this subsection, that owner shall not move any hive or hives or bees or bee equipment from the time he receives such notice until either thirty days thereafter or until the time he receives the results of the inspection, whichever occurs first. Any bees kept in anything other than a hive with removable frames such as box hives or other receptacles, natural or artificial, shall be deemed impossible to properly inspect, unless owner of said bees removes the brood or makes accessible for the director or his inspectors to inspect such brood. If the owner refuses or fails to remove the brood or make it accessible for inspection by the director or his inspectors, the director may order the colonies to be transferred to removable frame hives within six months. In the event the order is not carried out, the colonies in other than removable frame hives may be destroyed by the director or his inspectors. No fee will be charged for nonrequested inspection and no certificate will be issued for this type of inspection.\n\n3. Persons desiring to have specialized examinations conducted by the Missouri department of agriculture to determine freedom from diseases or pests may be charged a fee sufficient to cover the cost of such examination.\n\n4. The director, by request or suspicion of the existence of the pest Apis mellifera scutellata (Africanized bee), may inspect or cause to be inspected any property after written notice is sent to the property owner. Any bees found to be Africanized bees may be exterminated.\n\n(L. 1978 S.B. 683 § 4, A.L. 1985 H.B. 180, A.L. 1989 H.B. 134)",

Any apiary infected with any contagious or infectious bee disease or pest may be declared under quarantine and the owner thereof shall be prohibited from moving such apiary, bees, honey, wax or used beekeeping equipment.

Each application shall disclose the number of colonies of bees to be transported and a description of the location or locations where said bees are to be kept. Upon receipt of an application for a permit to move bees or used beekeeping equipment into the state, accompanied by a proper certificate of health and an application fee of ten dollars per application, the director shall issue the desired permit.

Whenever the director shall find that there exists in this state, or any part thereof, a harmful disease or pest of honey bees new to the state, which, for the protection of the apiculture industry within the state, should be prevented from spreading and be controlled or eradicated, the director may adopt and carry out such restrictive and control measures as may be deemed necessary and advisable and may cooperate with other state agencies and with the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\n2. The director may promulgate rules establishing quarantines and quarantine restrictions covering areas in the state affected by these honey bee diseases or pests, and other areas within the state which are likely to be affected by*such diseases and pests.\n\n3. Under such quarantines the director or authorized personnel may prohibit and prevent the movement, shipment or transportation without inspection of any honey bees, used beekeeping equipment or any other regulated material or article of any character capable of carrying such disease or pest in any living state of its development, originating in or which has been stored in such quarantined areas or in any area outside of the state infested with such disease or pest, except under such conditions as the director may prescribe as to inspection, treatment and certification. In carrying out the provisions of this section the director or authorized personnel may intercept, stop and detain for official inspection any person, car, vessel, boat, truck, automobile, aircraft, wagon or other vehicles or carriers whether air, land or water, and may open and inspect any container or shipment thought to be carrying such disease or pest in any living stage of its development. Any honey bees, used beekeeping equipment or any other regulated articles moved, shipped, or transported in violation of such quarantine may be seized and treated, destroyed or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the instructions of the director.\n\n4. Under such quarantines the director may require the treatment or destruction of infected or infested honey bee colonies as may be necessary to effectively destroy or prevent the development of such diseases and pests of honey bees. It shall be the duty of the owner or person in charge of such apiary or any other thing connected therewith within such quarantined area, upon due notice, to take such action as is required within the time limit specified and in the manner designated by the director.\n\n5. In case the owner or the person in charge of such apiary, used beekeeping equipment or other regulated materials within the quarantined area shall neglect or refuse to carry out the instructions of the director contained in such notice within the time limit specified, the director or authorized personnel may take the action so required, and the director shall have and enforce a lien for the expense thereof against the place in or upon which such expense was incurred in the same manner as liens are had and enforced upon buildings and lots, wharves and piers for labor and materials furnished by virtue of contract with the owner.\n\n(L. 1985 H.B. 180)\n\n*Word \"with\" appears in original rolls.",
