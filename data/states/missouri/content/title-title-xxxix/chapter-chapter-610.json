No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998, grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise, the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record unless the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.\n\n3. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received by the custodian of records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain format, the public body shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available. If access to the public record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be available for inspection. This period for document production may exceed three days for reasonable cause.\n\n4. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third business day following the date that the request for the statement is received.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 2, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1095, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1020, et al.)",

The public governmental body shall include notice to the requester that if the requester fails to remit payment of the fees within ninety days, or within one hundred fifty days if the requested fees are greater than one thousand dollars, then the request for public records shall be considered withdrawn. If the public governmental body responds to a request for public records in order to seek a clarification of the request and no response to the request for clarification is received by the public governmental body within ninety days, or within one hundred fifty days if the requested fees are greater than one thousand dollars, of sending the request for clarification, then such request for public records shall be considered withdrawn. The request for clarification by the public governmental body shall include notice to the requester that if the requester fails to respond within ninety days, or within one hundred fifty days if the requested fees are greater than one thousand dollars, then the request shall be considered withdrawn.

The remedies provided by this section against public governmental bodies shall be in addition to those provided by any other provision of law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or citizen of, this state, or the attorney general or prosecuting attorney, may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of sections 610.010 to 610.026. Suits to enforce sections 610.010 to 610.026 shall be brought in the circuit court for the county in which the public governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of a summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim, or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the provisions of sections 610.010 to 610.026, the custodian of the public record that is the subject matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption pursuant to section 610.021 or the assertion that the requested record is not a public record until the court directs otherwise.\n\n2.

Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has purposely violated sections 610.010 to 610.026, the public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five thousand dollars. If the court finds that there was a purposeful violation of sections 610.010 to 610.026, then the court shall order the payment by such body or member of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing such a violation. The court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public governmental body has violated sections 610.010 to 610.026 previously.\n\n5.

(1) Any person may bring an action pursuant to this section in the circuit court having jurisdiction to authorize disclosure of a mobile video recording or the information contained in an investigative report of any law enforcement agency, which would otherwise be closed pursuant to this section. The court may order that all or part of a mobile video recording or the information contained in an investigative report be released to the person bringing the action.\n\n(2) In making the determination as to whether information contained in an investigative report shall be disclosed, the court shall consider whether the benefit to the person bringing the action or to the public outweighs any harm to the public, to the law enforcement agency or any of its officers, or to any person identified in the investigative report in regard to the need for law enforcement agencies to effectively investigate and prosecute criminal activity.\n\n(3) In making the determination as to whether a mobile video recording shall be disclosed, the court shall consider:\n\n(a) Whether the benefit to the person bringing the action or the benefit to the public outweighs any harm to the public, to the law enforcement agency or any of its officers, or to any person identified in the mobile video recording in regard and with respect to the need for law enforcement agencies to effectively investigate and prosecute criminal activity;\n\n(b) Whether the mobile video recording contains information that is reasonably likely to disclose private matters in which the public has no legitimate concern;\n\n(c) Whether the mobile video recording is reasonably likely to bring shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities; and\n\n(d) Whether the mobile video recording was taken in a place where a person recorded or depicted has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n(4) The mobile video recording or investigative report in question may be examined by the court in camera.\n\n(5) If the disclosure is authorized in whole or in part, the court may make any order that justice requires, including one or more of the following:\n\n(a) That the mobile video recording or investigative report may be disclosed only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;\n\n(b) That the mobile video recording or investigative report may be had only by a method of disclosure other than that selected by the party seeking such disclosure and may be disclosed to the person making the request in a different manner or form as requested;\n\n(c) That the scope of the request be limited to certain matters;\n\n(d) That the disclosure occur with no one present except persons designated by the court;\n\n(e) That the mobile video recording or investigative report be redacted to exclude, for example, personally identifiable features or other sensitive information;\n\n(f) That a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way.\n\n(6) The court may find that the party seeking disclosure of the mobile video recording or the investigative report shall bear the reasonable and necessary costs and attorneys' fees of both parties, unless the court finds that the decision of the law enforcement agency not to open the mobile video recording or investigative report was substantially unjustified under all relevant circumstances, and in that event, the court may assess such reasonable and necessary costs and attorneys' fees to the law enforcement agency.\n\n6. Any person may apply pursuant to this subsection to the circuit court having jurisdiction for an order requiring a law enforcement agency to open incident reports and arrest reports being unlawfully closed pursuant to this section. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the law enforcement officer or agency has knowingly violated this section, the officer or agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one thousand dollars. If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of this section, the court may order payment by such officer or agency of all costs and attorneys' fees, as provided by section 610.027. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the law enforcement officer or agency has purposely violated this section, the officer or agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five thousand dollars and the court shall order payment by such officer or agency of all costs and attorney fees, as provided in section 610.027. The court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the seriousness of the offense, and whether the law enforcement officer or agency has violated this section previously.\n\n7. The victim of an offense as provided in chapter 566 may request that his or her identity be kept confidential until a charge relating to such incident is filed.\n\n8. Any person who requests and receives a mobile video recording that was recorded in a nonpublic location under and pursuant to this section is prohibited from displaying or disclosing the mobile video recording, including any description or account of any or all of the mobile video recording, without first providing direct third-party notice to each person not affiliated with a law enforcement agency or each non-law enforcement agency individual whose image or sound is contained in the recording, and affording, upon receiving such notice, each person appearing and whose image or sound is contained in the mobile video recording no less than ten days to file and serve an action seeking an order from a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin all or some of the intended display, disclosure, description, or account of the recording. Any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this subsection is subject to damages in a civil action proceeding.\n\n(L. 1973 S.B. 1 § 6, A.L. 1981 H.B. 554, A.L. 1993 H.B. 170, A.L. 1994 S.B. 554, A.L. 1995 H.B. 135, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1095, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1020, et al. merged with S.B. 1211, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1936 merged with S.B. 732 merged with S.B. 765, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1682)\n\n(2005) License plate numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, and month and date of birth of the parties in vehicular incident reports are not subject to disclosure as open records, and the public governmental body may redact such information.

The petition shall name as defendants all law enforcement agencies, courts, prosecuting or circuit attorneys, central state repositories of criminal records, or others who the petitioner has reason to believe may possess the records subject to expungement for each of the crimes listed in the petition. The court's order of expungement shall not affect any person or entity not named as a defendant in the action.\n\n5. The petition shall include the following information:\n\n(1) The petitioner's:\n\n(a) Full name;\n\n(d) Driver's license number, if applicable; and\n\n(e) Current address;\n\n(2) Each crime for which the petitioner is requesting expungement;\n\n(3) The approximate date the petitioner was charged for each crime; and\n\n(4) The name of the county where the petitioner was charged for each crime and if any of the crimes occurred in a municipality, the name of the municipality for each crime; and\n\n(5) The case number and name of the court for each crime.\n\n6. The clerk of the court shall give notice of the filing of the petition to the office of the prosecuting attorney that prosecuted the crimes listed in the petition. If the prosecuting attorney objects to the petition for expungement, he or she shall do so in writing within thirty days after receipt of service. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the court shall hold a hearing within sixty days after any written objection is filed, giving reasonable notice of the hearing to the petitioner. If no objection has been filed within thirty days after receipt of service, the court may set a hearing on the matter and shall give reasonable notice of the hearing to each entity named in the petition. At any hearing, the court may accept evidence and hear testimony on, and may consider, the following criteria for each of the crimes listed in the petition for expungement:\n\n(1) At the time the petition is filed, it has been at least three years if the offense is a felony, or at least one year if the offense is a misdemeanor, municipal violation, or infraction, from the date the petitioner completed any authorized disposition imposed under section 557.011 for each crime listed in the petition;\n\n(2) At the time the petition is filed, the person has not been found guilty of any other misdemeanor or felony, not including violations of the traffic regulations provided under chapters 301, 302, 303, 304, and 307, during the time period specified for the underlying crime in subdivision (1) of this subsection;\n\n(3) The person has satisfied all obligations relating to any such disposition, including the payment of any fines or restitution;\n\n(4) The person does not have charges pending;\n\n(5) The petitioner's habits and conduct demonstrate that the petitioner is not a threat to the public safety of the state; and\n\n(6) The expungement is consistent with the public welfare and the interests of justice warrant the expungement.\n\n­­A pleading by the petitioner that such petitioner meets the requirements of subdivisions (5) and (6) of this subsection shall create a rebuttable presumption that the expungement is warranted so long as the criteria contained in subdivisions (1) to (4) of this subsection are otherwise satisfied. The burden shall shift to the prosecuting attorney or circuit attorney to rebut the presumption. A victim of a crime listed in the petition shall have an opportunity to be heard at any hearing held under this section. A court may find that the continuing impact of the offense upon the victim rebuts the presumption that expungement is warranted.\n\n7. A petition to expunge records related to an arrest for an eligible crime may be made in accordance with the provisions of this section to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county where the petitioner was arrested no earlier than eighteen months from the date of arrest; provided that, during such time, the petitioner has not been charged and the petitioner has not been found guilty of any misdemeanor or felony offense.\n\n8. If the court determines that such person meets all the criteria set forth in subsection 6 of this section for each of the crimes listed in the petition for expungement, the court shall enter an order of expungement. In all cases under this section, the court shall issue an order of expungement or dismissal within six months of the filing of the petition. A copy of the order of expungement shall be provided to the petitioner and each entity possessing records subject to the order, and, upon receipt of the order, each entity shall close any record in its possession relating to any crime listed in the petition, in the manner established by section 610.120. The records and files maintained in any administrative or court proceeding in a municipal, associate, or circuit court for any crime ordered expunged under this section shall be confidential and only available to the parties or by order of the court for good cause shown. The central repository shall request the Federal Bureau of Investigation to expunge the records from its files.\n\n9. The order shall not limit any of the petitioner's rights that were restricted as a collateral consequence of such person's criminal record, and such rights shall be restored upon issuance of the order of expungement. Except as otherwise provided under this section, the effect of such order shall be to fully restore the civil rights of such person to the status he or she occupied prior to such arrests, pleas, trials, or convictions as if such events had never taken place. This includes fully restoring the civil rights of a person to the right to vote, the right to hold public office, and to serve as a juror. For purposes of 18 U.S.C. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), an order of expungement granted pursuant to this section shall be considered a complete removal of all effects of the expunged conviction. Except as otherwise provided under this section, the effect of such order shall be to restore such person to the status he or she occupied prior to such arrests, pleas, trials, or convictions as if such events had never taken place. No person as to whom such order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her failure to recite or acknowledge such arrests, pleas, trials, convictions, or expungement in response to an inquiry made of him or her and no such inquiry shall be made for information relating to an expungement, except the petitioner shall disclose the expunged crime to any court when asked or upon being charged with any subsequent crime. The expunged crime may be considered a prior offense in determining a sentence to be imposed for any subsequent offense that the person is found guilty of committing.\n\n10. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 9 of this section to the contrary, a person granted an expungement shall disclose any expunged crime when the disclosure of such information is necessary to complete any application for:\n\n(1) A license, certificate, or permit issued by this state to practice such individual's profession;\n\n(2) Any license issued under chapter 313 or permit issued under chapter 571;\n\n(3) Paid or unpaid employment with an entity licensed under chapter 313, any state-operated lottery, or any emergency services provider, including any law enforcement agency;\n\n(4) Employment with any federally insured bank or savings institution or credit union or an affiliate of such institution or credit union for the purposes of compliance with 12 U.S.C. Section 1829 and 12 U.S.C. Section 1785;\n\n(5) Employment with any entity engaged in the business of insurance or any insurer for the purpose of complying with 18 U.S.C. Section 1033, 18 U.S.C. Section 1034, or other similar law which requires an employer engaged in the business of insurance to exclude applicants with certain criminal convictions from employment; or\n\n(6) Employment with any employer that is required to exclude applicants with certain criminal convictions from employment due to federal or state law, including corresponding rules and regulations.\n\n­­An employer shall notify an applicant of the requirements under subdivisions (4) to (6) of this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an expunged crime shall not be grounds for automatic disqualification of an applicant, but may be a factor for denying employment, or a professional license, certificate, or permit; except that, a crime expunged under the provisions of this section may be grounds for automatic disqualification if the application is for employment under subdivisions (4) to (6) of this subsection.\n\n11. A person who has been granted an expungement of records pertaining to a crime may answer \"no\" to an employer's inquiry into whether the person has ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime if, after the granting of the expungement, the person has no public record of a crime. The person, however, shall answer such an inquiry affirmatively and disclose his or her criminal convictions, including any offense expunged under this section or similar law, if the employer is required to exclude applicants with certain criminal convictions from employment due to federal or state law, including corresponding rules and regulations.\n\n12. If the court determines that the petitioner has not met the criteria for any of the crimes listed in the petition for expungement or the petitioner has knowingly provided false information in the petition, the court shall enter an order dismissing the petition. Any person whose petition for expungement has been dismissed by the court for failure to meet the criteria set forth in subsection 6 of this section may not refile another petition until a year has passed since the date of filing for the previous petition.\n\n13. A person may be granted more than one expungement under this section provided that during his or her lifetime, the total number of crimes for which orders of expungement are granted to the person shall not exceed the following limits:\n\n(1) Not more than three misdemeanor offenses or ordinance violations that have an authorized term of imprisonment; and\n\n(2) Not more than two felony offenses.\n\n­­A person may be granted expungement under this section for any number of infractions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or impair in any way the subsequent use of any record expunged under this section of any arrests or findings of guilt by a law enforcement agency, criminal justice agency, prosecuting attorney or circuit attorney, including its use as a prior crime.\n\n14. The court shall make available a form for pro se petitioners seeking expungement, which shall include the following statement: \"I declare under penalty of perjury that the statements made herein are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.\".\n\n15. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict the availability of expungement to any person under any other law.\n\n(L. 2012 H.B. 1647, A.L. 2016 S.B. 588, 603 & 942, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1355 merged with S.B. 793 merged with S.B. 954, A.L. 2019 S.B. 1, A.L. 2021 S.B. 26 merged with S.B. 53 & 60, A.L. 2024 S.B. 754, et al.)\n\nEffective 1-01-25\n\n*Section 569.067 was repealed by S.B. 491, 2014, effective 1-01-17.\n\n**Section 569.072 was transferred to section 577.078 by S.B. 491, 2014, effective 1-01-17.",

It shall be the responsibility of the next of kin to show proof of the familial relationship. For purposes of such access, the deceased's next of kin shall be:\n\n(1) The spouse of the deceased if living;\n\n(2) If there is no living spouse of the deceased, an adult child of the deceased; or\n\n(3) If there is no living spouse or adult child, a parent of the deceased.\n\n2.

In making such determination, the court shall consider whether such disclosure is necessary for public evaluation of governmental performance, the seriousness of the intrusion into the family's right to privacy, and whether such disclosure is the least intrusive means available considering the availability of similar information in other public records.
