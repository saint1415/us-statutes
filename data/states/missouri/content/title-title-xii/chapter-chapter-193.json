Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of this section, for each adoption decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction in this state, the court shall require the preparation of a certificate of decree of adoption on a form as prescribed or approved by the state registrar. The certificate of decree of adoption shall include such facts as are necessary to locate and identify the certificate of birth of the person adopted, and shall provide information necessary to establish a new certificate of birth of the person adopted and shall identify the court and county of the adoption and be certified by the clerk of the court.

The department, upon receipt of proof that a person has been adopted by a Missouri resident pursuant to laws of countries other than the United States, shall prepare a birth certificate in the name of the adopted person as decreed by the court of such country.

Notwithstanding section 453.121 to the contrary, an adopted person or the adopted person's attorney or birth parents may obtain a copy of such adopted person's original certificate of birth from the state registrar in accordance with this section.\n\n3. In order for an adopted person to receive a copy of his or her original certificate of birth, the adopted person shall:\n\n(1) Be at least eighteen years of age;\n\n(2) Have been born in this state; and\n\n(3) File a written application with and provide appropriate proof of identification to the state registrar.\n\n4. The state registrar may require a waiting period and impose a fee for issuance of the uncertified copy under subsection 5 of this section. The fees and waiting period imposed under this subsection shall be identical to the fees and waiting period generally imposed on nonadopted persons seeking their own certificates of birth.\n\n5. Upon receipt of a written application and proof of identification under subsection 3 of this section and fulfillment of the requirements of subsection 4 of this section, the state registrar shall issue an uncertified copy of the unaltered original certificate of birth to the applicant.

A birth parent or adoptee may, at any time, request from the state registrar a contact preference form that shall accompany the original birth certificate of an adopted person. The birth parent shall provide appropriate proof of identification to the state registrar. The contact preference form shall include the following options:\n\n(1) \"I would like to be contacted\";\n\n(2) \"I prefer to be contacted by an intermediary\"; and\n\n(3) \"I prefer not to be contacted\".\n\n­­A contact preference form may be updated by a birth parent or adoptee at any time upon the request of the birth parent or adoptee.

If both birth parents indicate on the contact preference form that they would prefer not to be contacted, a copy of the original birth certificate of the adopted person shall not be released. If only one birth parent indicates on the contact preference form that he or she would prefer not to be contacted, his or her identifying information, as defined in section 453.121, shall be redacted from a copy of the original birth certificate of the adopted person and the copy of the original birth certificate shall be released under the provisions of this section.\n\n8.

The medical history form shall include the following options:\n\n(1) \"I am not aware of any medical history of any significance\";\n\n(2) \"I prefer not to provide any medical information at this time\"; and\n\n(3) \"I wish to give the following medical information\".\n\n­­A medical history form may be updated by a birth parent at any time upon the request of the birth parent.\n\n9.

Upon proof that an adopted person is deceased, his or her lineal descendants, as defined in section 453.121, shall have the right to obtain a copy of the adopted person's original birth certificate and accompanying contact preference form and medical history form in accordance with the provisions of this section, including the provisions of subsection 7 of this section regarding birth parent contact preferences and subsection 10 of this section regarding birth parent medical histories.\n\n12. The cost of a contact preference form shall not exceed the cost of obtaining an original birth certificate. There shall be no charge for a medical history form.\n\n13. Beginning August 28, 2016, there shall be a public notification period to allow time for birth parents to file a contact preference form. Beginning January 1, 2018, original birth certificates shall be issued under the provisions of this section. An adopted person born prior to 1941 shall be given access to his or her original birth certificate beginning August 28, 2016.\n\n14. The state registrar shall develop by rule the application form required by this section and may adopt other rules for the administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2016, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2016 H.B. 1599, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1713)",

In the absence of the physician, physician assistant, assistant physician, or advanced practice registered nurse or with the physician's, physician assistant's, assistant physician's, or advanced practice registered nurse's approval the certificate may be completed and attested to its accuracy either by signature or an approved electronic process by the physician's associate physician, the chief medical officer of the institution in which death occurred, or the physician who performed an autopsy upon the decedent, provided such individual has access to the medical history of the case, views the deceased at or after death and death is due to natural causes. The person authorized to complete the medical certification may, in writing, designate any other person to enter the medical certification information into the electronic death registration system if the person authorized to complete the medical certificate has physically or by electronic process signed a statement stating the cause of death. Any persons completing the medical certification or entering data into the electronic death registration system shall be immune from civil liability for such certification completion, data entry, or determination of the cause of death, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct.

If the circumstances suggest that the death was caused by other than natural causes, the medical examiner or coroner shall determine the cause of death and shall, either by signature or an approved electronic process, complete and attest to the accuracy of the medical certification within seventy-two hours after taking charge of the case.\n\n8. If the cause of death cannot be determined within seventy-two hours after death, the attending medical examiner, coroner, attending physician, physician assistant, assistant physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or local registrar shall give the funeral director, or person in charge of final disposition of the dead body, notice of the reason for the delay, and final disposition of the body shall not be made until authorized by the medical examiner, coroner, attending physician, physician assistant, assistant physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or local registrar.\n\n9. When a death is presumed to have occurred within this state but the body cannot be located, a death certificate may be prepared by the state registrar upon receipt of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction which shall include the finding of facts required to complete the death certificate.
