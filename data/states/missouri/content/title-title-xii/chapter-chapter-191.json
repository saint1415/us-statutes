A health care provider may disclose a deceased patient's health care records or payment records to the executor or administrator of the deceased person's estate, or pursuant to a valid, unrevoked power of attorney for health care that specifically directs that the deceased person's health care records be released to the agent after death. If an executor, administrator, or agent has not been appointed, the deceased prior to death did not specifically object to disclosure of his or her records in writing, and such disclosure is not inconsistent with any prior expressed preference of the deceased that is known to the health care provider, a deceased patient's health care records may be released upon written request of a person who is deemed as the personal representative of the deceased person under this subsection.

(1) Records containing a patient's health history and treatment created by an emergency care provider, as defined in section 191.630, or a telecommunicator first responder, as defined in section 650.320, in the course of the provider's or responder's official duties while responding to a formal request for assistance shall be made available, upon written request, to any person authorized to obtain the patient's health care records under the provisions of this section, or in response to a subpoena or court order.\n\n(2) The furnishing of health care records under this subsection may be conditioned upon the payment of a fee in an amount equal to the fee allowed for the furnishing of any other health care record under this section.\n\n(3) Personal health information, including patient health history and treatment, shall not be considered a public record, as described under chapter 610. Nothing in this section shall limit the release of information or public records with personal health information that is redacted regarding the general nature of the event.\n\n(4) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the release of information to facilitate the normal delivery of patient care or to evaluate the quality of care as part of an established quality improvement program.\n\n(L. 1988 H.B. 925 § 1, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1427, A.L. 2002 S.B. 923, et al., A.L. 2005 H.B. 232, A.L. 2011 S.B. 62, A.L. 2013 H.B. 351, A.L. 2017 S.B. 501, A.L. 2018 S.B. 718 merged with S.B. 826 merged with S.B. 951, A.L. 2025 S.B. 71)\n\nCROSS REFERENCES:\n\nChild's medical records to be released to parents, attorney's costs assessed, when, 452.375\n\nNonseverability clause, 190.840",

The department shall adopt rules to implement this section. The department may determine by rule the communicable diseases for which testing is reasonable and appropriate and which may be administered pursuant to this section.

If the panel is uncertain about whether a procedure may pose some risk of HIV or HBV transmission, it may recommend that such procedures be performed only after the patients have been informed of the health care professional's infection status.\n\n(5) (a) Information obtained during the evaluation process shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except to health care facilities where the health care professional provides patient care. The department of health and senior services may only notify or disclose to such facilities the practice restrictions and limitations imposed on the health care professional. Such restrictions and limitations shall be disclosed only to those employed by such health care facilities who have a reasonable need to know the information.\n\n(b) Practice restrictions or limitations recommended by the department of health and senior services shall be monitored by the health care facilities in which the infected health care professional is employed. If practice restrictions or limitations are placed on community based health care professionals, periodic monitoring to ensure compliance shall be performed by the department of health and senior services.\n\n(c) Health care professionals whose practices are restricted or limited because of their HIV or HBV infection status shall, whenever possible, be provided opportunities to continue appropriate patient care activities.\n\n(d) Health care facilities regulated under sections 197.010 to 197.120 may maintain or establish peer review panels that operate under the regulations developed by the department of health and senior services and the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control of the United States Public Health Service.\n\n(e) Any violation of practice restrictions or limitations by a health care professional shall constitute either an act violative of professional trust and confidence, or failure or refusal to properly guard against contagious infections or communicable diseases or the spread thereof, or both, as these terms are used in sections 330.160, 332.321, 334.100, and 335.066. Complaints of possible violations of practice restrictions or limitations may be made to the appropriate state board, as provided under chapter 330, chapter 332, chapter 334, or chapter 335.\n\n3. The department of health and senior services shall, from time to time, review established standards for preventing the transmission of HIV or HBV from health care professionals to patients and, consistent with current medical knowledge and revised or updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control, modify existing standards and require additional minimum standards, as appropriate.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 191.650 to 191.698, the department of health and senior services may exercise the general authority and power under section 192.020 to intervene in instances where there is reason to believe that a health care professional is practicing in a manner that creates a grave and unjustifiable risk of injury to others.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 511 & 556 § 191.694 subsecs. 6 to 9)",

Upon submitting a claim for or upon receiving payment for health care under a medical assistance program, a person shall not destroy or conceal any records for five years after the date on which payment was received, if payment was received, or for five years after the date on which the claim was submitted, if payment was not received. Any provider who knowingly destroys or conceals such records is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n4.

The provisions of this section and section 630.202 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Essential Caregiver Program Act\".\n\n2. As used in this section, the following terms mean:\n\n(1)\"Department\", the department of health and senior services;\n\n(2)\"Essential caregiver\", a family member, friend, guardian, or other individual selected by a facility resident or patient who has not been adjudged incapacitated under chapter 475, or the guardian or legal representative of the resident or patient;\n\n(3)\"Facility\", a hospital licensed under chapter 197 or a facility licensed under chapter 198.\n\n3. During a state of emergency declared pursuant to chapter 44 relating to infectious, contagious, communicable, or dangerous diseases, a facility shall allow a resident or patient who has not been adjudged incapacitated under chapter 475, a resident's or patient's guardian, or a resident's or patient's legally authorized representative to designate an essential caregiver for in-person contact with the resident or patient in accordance with the standards and guidelines developed by the department under this section. Essential caregivers shall be considered as part of the resident's or patient's care team, along with the resident's or patient's health care providers and facility staff.\n\n4. The facility shall inform, in writing, residents and patients who have not been adjudged incapacitated under chapter 475, or guardians or legal representatives of residents or patients, of the essential caregiver program and the process for designating an essential caregiver.\n\n5. The department shall develop standards and guidelines concerning the essential caregiver program, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The facility shall allow at least two individuals per resident or patient to be designated as essential caregivers, although the facility may limit the in-person contact to one caregiver at a time. The caregiver shall not be required to have previously served in a caregiver capacity prior to the declared state of emergency;\n\n(2) The facility shall establish a reasonable in-person contact schedule to allow the essential caregiver to provide care to the resident or patient for at least four hours each day, including evenings, weekends, and holidays, but shall allow for twenty-four-hour in-person care as necessary and appropriate for the well-being of the resident or patient. The essential caregiver shall be permitted to leave and return during the scheduled hours or be replaced by another essential caregiver;\n\n(3) The facility shall establish procedures to enable physical contact between the resident or patient and the essential caregiver. The facility may not require the essential caregiver to undergo more stringent screening, testing, hygiene, personal protective equipment, and other infection control and prevention protocols than required of facility employees;\n\n(4) The facility shall specify in its protocols the criteria that the facility will use if it determines that in-person contact by a particular essential caregiver is inconsistent with the resident's or patient's therapeutic care and treatment or is a safety risk to other residents, patients, or staff at the facility. Any limitations placed upon a particular essential caregiver shall be reviewed and documented every seven days to determine if the limitations remain appropriate; and\n\n(5) The facility may restrict or revoke in-person contact by an essential caregiver who fails to follow required protocols and procedures established under this subsection.\n\n6. (1) A facility may request from the department a suspension of in-person contact by essential caregivers for a period not to exceed seven days. The department may deny the facility's request to suspend in-person contact with essential caregivers if the department determines that such in-person contact does not pose a serious community health risk. A facility may request from the department an extension of a suspension for more than seven days; provided, that the department shall not approve an extension period for longer than seven days at a time. A facility shall not suspend in-person caregiver contact for more than fourteen consecutive days in a twelve-month period or for more than forty-five total days in a twelve-month period.\n\n(2) The department shall suspend in-person contact by essential caregivers under this section if it determines that doing so is required under federal law, including a determination that federal law requires a suspension of in-person contact by members of the resident's or patient's care team.\n\n(3) The attorney general shall institute all suits necessary on behalf of the state to defend the right of the state to implement the provisions of this section to ensure access by residents and patients to essential caregivers as part of their care team.\n\n7. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to require an essential caregiver to provide necessary care to a resident or patient and a facility shall not require an essential caregiver to provide necessary care.\n\n8. The provisions of this section shall not apply to those residents or patients whose particular plan of therapeutic care and treatment necessitates restricted or otherwise limited visitation for reasons unrelated to the stated reasons for the declared state emergency.\n\n9. A facility, its employees, and its contractors shall be immune from civil liability for an injury or harm caused by or resulting from:\n\n(1) Exposure to a contagious disease or other harmful agent that is specified during the state of emergency declared pursuant to chapter 44; or\n\n(2) Acts or omissions by essential caregivers who are present in the facility;\n\n­­as a result of the implementation of the essential caregiver program under this section.
