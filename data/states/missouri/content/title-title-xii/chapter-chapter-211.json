Purpose of law — how construed. —The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate the care, protection and discipline of children who come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. This chapter shall be liberally construed, therefore, to the end that each child coming within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall receive such care, guidance and control as will conduce to the child's welfare and the best interests of the state, and that when such child is removed from the control of his parents the court shall secure for him care as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given him by them. The child welfare policy of this state is what is in the best interests of the child.\n\n(L. 1957 p. 642 § 211.010, A.L. 1995 H.B. 232 & 485 merged with S.B. 174)\n\n(1968) Procedure of juvenile court which resulted in commitment to state training school did not violate constitutional protection as set forth by U.S. Supreme Court in the case of application of Gault. Ex parte de Grace (A.), 425 S.W.2d 228.\n\n(1972) Missouri's Juvenile Act is rooted in the concept of parens patriae and the functions of a juvenile officer and a prosecuting attorney are so inherently conflicting that proper administration of the Juvenile Act does not allow these functions to be exercised by a person holding both offices. Thus, juvenile court, located in county in judicial circuit comprised only of counties of the third class, was without jurisdiction to proceed on petition filed by such juvenile officer. In re F_______ C_______(A.), 484 S.W.2d 21.\n\n(1977) Jurisdiction of divorce or dissolution of marriage remains in circuit court where it was filed but jurisdictions of cause as it relates to child custody may in some instances be superseded by juvenile court. Ex parte J.A.P. (A.), 546 S.W.2d 806.",

In deciding if it is in the best interests of the youth to be returned to the custody of the children's division under this section, the court shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) The circumstances of the youth;\n\n(2) Whether the children's division has services or programs in place that will benefit the youth and assist the youth in transitioning to self-sufficiency; and\n\n(3) Whether the youth has the commitment to fully cooperate with the children's division in developing and implementing a case plan.\n\n­­The court shall not return a youth to the custody of the children's division who has been committed to the custody of another agency; who is under a legal guardianship; or who has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a felony criminal offense.\n\n2. The youth shall cooperate with the case plan developed for the youth by the children's division in consultation with the youth.\n\n3. For purposes of this section, a\"youth\"is any person eighteen years of age or older and under twenty-one years of age who was in the custody of the children's division in foster care at any time in the two-year period preceding the youth's eighteenth birthday.\n\n4. The court may, upon motion of the children's division or the youth, terminate care and supervision before the youth's twenty-first birthday if the court finds the children's division does not have services available for the youth, the youth no longer needs services, or if the youth declines to cooperate with the case plan.\n\n5. The youth, at the youth's discretion, may request to be appointed a guardian ad litem. If a guardian ad litem is appointed, he or she shall serve under section 210.160.\n\n6. The court shall hold review hearings as necessary, but in no event less than once every six months for as long as the youth is in the custody of the children's division.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 502, et al., A.L. 2013 S.B. 205 merged with S.B. 208, A.L. 2016 H.B. 1877)",

Certification as an adult, placement in secure detention facility to continue transfer to adult jail, when, procedure — limitation on time in adult jail — requirements for pretrial-certified juveniles — per diem. —1. A juvenile under eighteen years of age who has been certified to stand trial as an adult for offenses pursuant to section 211.071, if currently placed in a secure juvenile detention facility, shall remain in a secure juvenile detention facility pending finalization of the judgment and completion of appeal, if any, of the judgment dismissing the juvenile petition to allow for prosecution under the general law unless otherwise ordered by the juvenile court. Upon the judgment dismissing the petition to allow prosecution under the general laws becoming final and adult charges being filed, if the juvenile is currently in a secure juvenile detention facility, the juvenile shall remain in such facility unless the juvenile posts bond or the juvenile is transferred to an adult jail. If the juvenile officer does not believe juvenile detention would be the appropriate placement or would continue to serve as the appropriate placement, the juvenile officer may file a motion in the adult criminal case requesting that the juvenile be transferred from a secure juvenile detention facility to an adult jail. The court shall hear evidence relating to the appropriateness of the juvenile remaining in a secure juvenile detention facility or being transferred to an adult jail. At such hearing, the following shall have the right to be present and have the opportunity to present evidence and recommendations at such hearing: the juvenile; the juvenile's parents; the juvenile's counsel; the prosecuting attorney; the juvenile officer or his or her designee for the circuit in which the juvenile was certified; the juvenile officer or his or her designee for the circuit in which the pretrial-certified juvenile is proposed to be held, if different from the circuit in which the juvenile was certified; counsel for the juvenile officer; and representatives of the county proposed to have custody of the pretrial-certified juvenile.\n\n2. Following the hearing, the court shall order that the juvenile continue to be held in a secure juvenile detention facility subject to all Missouri juvenile detention standards, or the court shall order that the pretrial-certified juvenile be held in an adult jail but only after the court has made findings that it would be in the best interest of justice to move the pretrial-certified juvenile to an adult jail. The court shall weigh the following factors when deciding whether to detain a certified juvenile in an adult facility:\n\n(1) The certified juvenile's age;\n\n(2) The certified juvenile's physical and mental maturity;\n\n(3) The certified juvenile's present mental state, including whether he or she presents an imminent risk of self-harm;\n\n(4) The nature and circumstances of the charges;\n\n(5) The certified juvenile's history of delinquency;\n\n(6) The relative ability of the available adult and juvenile facilities to both meet the needs of the certified juvenile and to protect the public and other youth in their custody;\n\n(7) The opinion of the juvenile officer in the circuit of the proposed placement as to the ability of that juvenile detention facility to provide for appropriate care, custody, and control of the pretrial-certified juvenile; and\n\n(8) Any other relevant factor.\n\n3. In the event the court finds that it is in the best interest of justice to require the certified juvenile to be held in an adult jail, the court shall hold a hearing once every thirty days to determine whether the placement of the certified juvenile in an adult jail is still in the best interests of justice. If a pretrial-certified juvenile under eighteen years of age is ordered released on the juvenile's adult criminal case from an adult jail following a transfer order under subsection 2 of this section and the juvenile is detained on violation of the conditions of release or bond, the juvenile shall return to the custody of the adult jail pending further court order.\n\n4. A certified juvenile cannot be held in an adult jail for more than one hundred eighty days unless the court finds, for good cause, that an extension is necessary or the juvenile, through counsel, waives the one hundred eighty day maximum period. If no extension is granted under this subsection, the certified juvenile shall be transferred from the adult jail to a secure juvenile detention facility. If an extension is granted under this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing once every thirty days to determine whether the placement of the certified juvenile in an adult jail is still in the best interests of justice.\n\n5. Effective December 31, 2021, all previously pretrial-certified juveniles under eighteen years of age who had been certified prior to August 28, 2021, shall be transferred from adult jail to a secure juvenile detention facility, unless a hearing is held and the court finds, based upon the factors in subsection 2 of this section, that it would be in the best interest of justice to keep the juvenile in the adult jail.\n\n6. All pretrial-certified juveniles under eighteen years of age who are held in adult jails pursuant to the best interest of justice exception shall continue to be subject to the protections of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and shall be physically separated from adult inmates.\n\n7. If the certified juvenile remains in juvenile detention, the juvenile officer may file a motion to reconsider placement. The court shall consider the factors set out in subsection 2 of this section and the individuals set forth in subsection 1 of this section shall have a right to be present and present evidence. The court may amend its earlier order in light of the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing if the court finds that it would not be in the best interest of justice for the juvenile to remain in a secure juvenile detention facility.\n\n8. Issues related to the setting of, and posting of, bond along with any bond forfeiture proceedings shall be held in the pretrial-certified juvenile's adult criminal case.\n\n9. Upon attaining eighteen years of age or upon a plea of guilty or conviction on the adult charges, the juvenile shall be transferred from juvenile detention to the appropriate adult facility.\n\n10. Any responsibility for transportation of and contracted service for the certified juvenile who remains in a secure juvenile detention facility shall be handled by county jail staff in the same manner as in all other adult criminal cases where the defendant is in custody.\n\n11. The county jail staff shall designate a liaison assigned to each pretrial-certified juvenile while housed in a juvenile detention facility, who shall assist in communication with the juvenile detention facility on the needs of the juvenile including, but not limited to, visitation, legal case status, medical and mental health needs, and phone contact.\n\n12. The per diem provisions as set forth in section 211.156 shall apply to certified juveniles who are being held in a secure juvenile detention facility.\n\n(L. 2021 S.B. 53 & 60, A.L. 2025 S.B. 43)",

The court shall, in a case when the offender is under eighteen years of age and has been transferred to a court of general jurisdiction pursuant to section 211.071, and whose prosecution results in a conviction or a plea of guilty, consider dual jurisdiction of both the criminal and juvenile codes, as set forth in this section. The court is authorized to impose a juvenile disposition under this chapter and simultaneously impose an adult criminal sentence, the execution of which shall be suspended pursuant to the provisions of this section. Successful completion of the juvenile disposition ordered shall be a condition of the suspended adult criminal sentence. The court may order an offender into the custody of the division of youth services pursuant to this section:\n\n(1) Upon agreement of the division of youth services; and\n\n(2) If the division of youth services determines that there is space available in a facility designed to serve offenders sentenced under this section.­­If the division of youth services agrees to accept a youth and the court does not impose a juvenile disposition, the court shall make findings on the record as to why the division of youth services was not appropriate for the offender prior to imposing the adult criminal sentence.\n\n­­If the division of youth services agrees to accept a youth and the court does not impose a juvenile disposition, the court shall make findings on the record as to why the division of youth services was not appropriate for the offender prior to imposing the adult criminal sentence.\n\n2.

If the violation is established and found the court may continue or revoke the juvenile disposition, impose the adult criminal sentence, or enter such other order as it may see fit.\n\n3. When an offender has received a suspended sentence pursuant to this section and the division determines the child is beyond the scope of its treatment programs, the division of youth services may petition the court for a transfer of custody of the offender. The court shall hold a hearing and shall:\n\n(1) Revoke the suspension and direct that the offender be taken into immediate custody of the department of corrections; or\n\n(2) Direct that the offender be placed on probation.\n\n4.

Whenever any person informs the juvenile officer in writing that a child appears to be within the purview of applicable provisions of section 211.031, the juvenile officer shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry to determine the facts and to determine whether or not the interests of the public or of the child require that further action be taken.

Order to include determination of efforts of division — definition of reasonable efforts by division — modification of the permanency plan, when — reasonable efforts not required, when — permanency hearing, when. —1. In juvenile court proceedings regarding the removal of a child from his or her home, the court's order shall include a determination of whether the children's division has made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child and, after removal, to make it possible for the child to return home. If the first contact with the family occurred during an emergency in which the child could not safely remain at home even with reasonable in-home services, the division shall be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal.\n\n2.\"Reasonable efforts\"means the exercise of reasonable diligence and care by the division to utilize all available services related to meeting the needs of the juvenile and the family. In determining reasonable efforts to be made and in making such reasonable efforts, the child's present and ongoing health and safety shall be the paramount consideration.\n\n3. In support of its determination of whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall enter findings, including a brief description of what preventive or reunification efforts were made and why further efforts could or could not have prevented or shortened the separation of the family. The division shall have the burden of demonstrating reasonable efforts.\n\n4. The juvenile court may authorize the removal of the child even if the preventive and reunification efforts of the division have not been reasonable, but further efforts could not permit the child to remain at home.\n\n5. Before a child may be removed from the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child by order of a juvenile court, excluding commitments to the division of youth services, the court shall in its orders:\n\n(1) State whether removal of the child is necessary to protect the child and the reasons therefor;\n\n(2) Describe the services available to the family before removal of the child, including in-home services;\n\n(3) Describe the efforts made to provide those services relevant to the needs of the family before the removal of the child;\n\n(4) State why efforts made to provide family services described did not prevent removal of the child; and\n\n(5) State whether efforts made to prevent removal of the child were reasonable, based upon the needs of the family and child.\n\n6. If continuation of reasonable efforts, as described in this section, is determined by the division to be inconsistent with establishing a permanent placement for the child, the division shall take such steps as are deemed necessary by the division, including seeking modification of any court order to modify the permanency plan for the child.\n\n7. The division shall not be required to make reasonable efforts, as defined in this section, but has the discretion to make reasonable efforts if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that:\n\n(1) The parent has subjected the child to a severe act or recurrent acts of physical, emotional or sexual abuse toward the child, including an act of incest; or\n\n(2) The parent has:\n\n(a) Committed murder of another child of the parent;\n\n(b) Committed voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent;\n\n(c) Aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to commit such a murder or voluntary manslaughter; or\n\n(d) Committed a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury to the child or to another child of the parent; or\n\n(3) The parent's parental rights to a sibling have been involuntarily terminated.\n\n8. If the court determines that reasonable efforts, as described in this section, are not required to be made by the division, the court shall hold a permanency hearing within thirty days after the court has made such determination. The division shall complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.\n\n9.

Court may order parents and child to make restitution, when, amount — restitution hearing required, when, procedure — community service — execution of judgment. —1. In addition to the court's authority to issue an order for the child to make restitution or reparation for the damage or loss caused by his offense as provided in section 211.181, the court may enter a judgment of restitution against both the parent and the child pursuant to the provisions of this section if the court finds that the parent has failed to exercise reasonable parental discipline or authority to prevent the damage or loss and the child has:\n\n(1) Stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, unlawfully obtained, or substantially decreased the value of the property of another; or\n\n(2) Inflicted personal injury on another, requiring the injured person to incur medical, dental, hospital, funeral, or burial expenses.\n\n2. The court may order both the parent and the child to make restitution to:\n\n(1) The victim;\n\n(2) Any governmental entity; or\n\n(3) A third-party payor, including an insurer, that has made payment to the victim to compensate the victim for a property loss or a pecuniary loss under subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection 1 of this section.\n\n3. Restitution payments to the victim have priority over restitution payments to a third-party payor. If the victim has been compensated for the victim's loss by a third-party payor, the court may order restitution payments to the third-party payor in the amount that the third-party payor compensated the victim.\n\n4. Payment of restitution to a victim under this section has priority over payment of restitution to any governmental entity.\n\n5. Considering the age and circumstances of a child, the court may order the child to make restitution to the wronged person personally.\n\n6. A restitution hearing to determine the liability of the parent and the child shall be held not later than thirty days after the disposition hearing and may be extended by the court for good cause. In the restitution hearing, a written statement or bill for medical, dental, hospital, funeral, or burial expenses shall be prima facie evidence that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill represents a fair and reasonable charge for the services or materials provided. The burden of proving that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill is not fair and reasonable shall be on the person challenging the fairness and reasonableness of the amount.\n\n7. A judgment of restitution against a parent may not be entered unless the parent has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence in his behalf. The parent shall be advised of his right to obtain counsel for representation at the hearing. A hearing under this section may be held as part of an adjudicatory or disposition hearing for the child.\n\n8. The judgment may be enforced in the same manner as enforcing monetary judgments.\n\n9. A judgment of restitution ordered pursuant to this section against a child and his parents shall not be a bar to a proceeding against the child and his parents pursuant to section 537.045 or section 8.150 for the balance of the damages not paid pursuant to this section. In no event, however, may the total restitution paid by the child and his parents pursuant to this section, section 8.150, and section 537.045 exceed four thousand dollars.\n\n10. The child may be ordered to work in a court-approved community service work site at a rate of compensation not to exceed minimum wage. The number of hours worked shall be reported to the juvenile officer and the compensation earned for these hours shall be used for the sole purpose of satisfying the judgment entered against the child in accordance with this section. Upon application by the juvenile officer made with the juvenile court's written approval, the clerk of the court of the circuit where the fund is deposited and where a judgment has been entered in accordance with this section shall pay the compensation earned by the child to the person in whose favor the judgment has been entered.\n\n11.

If a child under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court appears to be intellectually disabled or developmentally disabled, as these terms are defined in chapter 630, the court, on its own motion or on the motion or petition of any interested party, may order the department of mental health to evaluate the child.\n\n2. A regional center designated by the department of mental health shall perform within twenty days a comprehensive evaluation, as defined in chapter 633, on an outpatient basis if practicable, for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of a referral to a developmental disability facility operated or funded by the department of mental health. If it is determined by the regional center, as a result of the evaluation, to be appropriate to refer such child to a department developmental disability facility under section 633.120 or a private developmental disability facility under section 630.610, the regional center shall refer the evaluation to the appropriate developmental disability facility.\n\n3. If, as a result of reviewing the evaluation, the head of the developmental disability facility, or his designee, determines that it is appropriate to admit such child as a resident, the head of the developmental disability facility, or his or her designee, shall recommend the child for admission, subject to availability of suitable accommodations. The head of the regional center, or his designee, shall send the juvenile court notice of the recommendation for admission by the developmental disability facility and a copy of the evaluation.

If the department proposes placement at, or transferring the child to, a department facility other than that designated in the order of the juvenile court, the department shall conduct a due process hearing within six days of such placement or transfer during which the head of the initiating facility shall have the burden to show that the placement or transfer is appropriate for the medical needs of the child.

Where it appears to the court that a conflict exists, it shall order that the child and his custodian be represented by separate counsel, and it shall appoint counsel if required by subsection 3 or 4 of this section.\n\n8. When a petition has been filed, a child may waive his or her right to counsel only with the approval of the court and if such waiver is not prohibited under subsection 10 of this section.

In any subsequent proceeding, the child shall be informed of his or her right to counsel.\n\n9. Waiver of counsel by a child may be withdrawn at any stage of the proceeding, in which event the court shall appoint counsel for the child if required by subsection 3 of this section.\n\n10.

Juvenile officer preliminary inquiry, when — petition to terminate parental rights filed, when — juvenile court may terminate parental rights, when — investigation to be made — grounds for termination. —1. Any information that could justify the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights may be referred to the juvenile officer by any person. The juvenile officer shall make a preliminary inquiry and if it appears that the information could justify the filing of a petition, the juvenile officer may take further action, including filing a petition. If it does not appear to the juvenile officer that a petition should be filed, such officer shall so notify the informant in writing within thirty days of the referral. Such notification shall include the reasons that the petition will not be filed.\n\n2. Except as provided for in subsection 4 of this section, a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's parent or parents shall be filed by the juvenile officer or the division, or if such a petition has been filed by another party, the juvenile officer or the division shall seek to be joined as a party to the petition, when:\n\n(1) Information available to the juvenile officer or the division establishes that the child has been in foster care for at least fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; or\n\n(2) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined the child to be an abandoned child. For purposes of this subdivision, a\"child\"means any child under two years of age at the time of filing of the petition. The court may find that a child has been abandoned if:\n\n(a) The parent has left the child under circumstances that the identity of the child was unknown and could not be ascertained, despite diligent searching, and the parent has not come forward to claim the child; or\n\n(b) The parent has, without good cause, left the child without any provision for parental support and without making arrangements to visit or communicate with the child, although able to do so, or, for a period of sixty days when the child was under one year of age, willfully, substantially, and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary care and protection; or\n\n(c) The parent has voluntarily relinquished a child under section 210.950; or\n\n(3) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the parent has:\n\n(a) Committed murder of another child of the parent; or\n\n(b) Committed voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent; or\n\n(c) Aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to commit such a murder or voluntary manslaughter; or\n\n(d) Committed a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury to the child or to another child of the parent; or\n\n(4) The parent has been found guilty of or pled guilty to a felony violation of chapter 566, 567, 568, or 573 when the child or any child was a victim. As used in this subdivision, a\"child\"means any person who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the offense.\n\n3. A termination of parental rights petition shall be filed by the juvenile officer or the division, or if such a petition has been filed by another party, the juvenile officer or the division shall seek to be joined as a party to the petition, within sixty days of the judicial determinations required in subsection 2 of this section, except as provided in subsection 4 of this section. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to adjudicate a petition for termination of parental rights which is filed outside of sixty days.\n\n4. If grounds exist for termination of parental rights pursuant to subsection 2 of this section, the juvenile officer or the division may, but is not required to, file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's parent or parents if:\n\n(1) The child is being cared for by a relative; or\n\n(2) There exists a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interest of the child, as documented in the permanency plan which shall be made available for court review; or\n\n(3) The family of the child has not been provided such services as provided for in section 211.183.\n\n5. The juvenile officer or the division may file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's parent when it appears that one or more of the following grounds for termination exist:\n\n(1) The child has been abandoned. For purposes of this subdivision a\"child\"means any child two years of age or older at the time of filing of the petition. The court shall find that the child has been abandoned if, for a period of six months or longer:\n\n(a) The parent has left the child under such circumstances that the identity of the child was unknown and could not be ascertained, despite diligent searching, and the parent has not come forward to claim the child; or\n\n(b) The parent has, for a period of six months immediately prior to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights, willfully, substantially, and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary care and protection;\n\n(2) The child has been abused or neglected. In determining whether to terminate parental rights pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall consider and make findings on the following conditions or acts of the parent:\n\n(a) A mental condition which is shown by competent evidence either to be permanent or such that there is no reasonable likelihood that the condition can be reversed and which renders the parent unable to knowingly provide the child the necessary care, custody and control;\n\n(b) Chemical dependency which prevents the parent from consistently providing the necessary care, custody and control of the child and which cannot be treated so as to enable the parent to consistently provide such care, custody and control;\n\n(c) A severe act or recurrent acts of physical, emotional or sexual abuse toward the child or any child in the family by the parent, including an act of incest, or by another under circumstances that indicate that the parent knew or should have known that such acts were being committed toward the child or any child in the family; or\n\n(d) Repeated or continuous failure by the parent, although physically or financially able, to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education as defined by law, or other care and control necessary for the child's physical, mental, or emotional health and development.\n\n­­Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit discrimination on the basis of disability or disease;\n\n(3) The child has been under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for a period of one year, and the court finds that the conditions which led to the assumption of jurisdiction still persist, or conditions of a potentially harmful nature continue to exist, that there is little likelihood that those conditions will be remedied at an early date so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future, or the continuation of the parent-child relationship greatly diminishes the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent home. In determining whether to terminate parental rights under this subdivision, the court shall consider and make findings on the following:\n\n(a) The terms of a social service plan entered into by the parent and the division and the extent to which the parties have made progress in complying with those terms;\n\n(b) The success or failure of the efforts of the juvenile officer, the division or other agency to aid the parent on a continuing basis in adjusting his circumstances or conduct to provide a proper home for the child;\n\n(c) A mental condition which is shown by competent evidence either to be permanent or such that there is no reasonable likelihood that the condition can be reversed and which renders the parent unable to knowingly provide the child the necessary care, custody and control;\n\n(d) Chemical dependency which prevents the parent from consistently providing the necessary care, custody and control over the child and which cannot be treated so as to enable the parent to consistently provide such care, custody and control; or\n\n(4) The child was conceived and born as a result of an act of forcible rape or rape in the first degree. When the biological father has pled guilty to, or is convicted of, the forcible rape or rape in the first degree of the birth mother, such a plea or conviction shall be conclusive evidence supporting the termination of the biological father's parental rights; or\n\n(5) (a) The parent is unfit to be a party to the parent and child relationship because of a consistent pattern of committing a specific abuse including, but not limited to, specific conditions directly relating to the parent and child relationship which are determined by the court to be of a duration or nature that renders the parent unable for the reasonably foreseeable future to care appropriately for the ongoing physical, mental, or emotional needs of the child.\n\n(b) It is presumed that a parent is unfit to be a party to the parent and child relationship upon a showing that:\n\na. Within a three-year period immediately prior to the termination adjudication, the parent's parental rights to one or more other children were involuntarily terminated pursuant to subsection 2 or 4 of this section or subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection or similar laws of other states;\n\nb. If the parent is the birth mother and within eight hours after the child's birth, the child's birth mother tested positive and over eight-hundredths of one percent blood alcohol content pursuant to testing under section 577.020 for alcohol, or tested positive for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, a controlled substance as defined in section 195.010, or a prescription drug as defined in section 196.973, excepting those controlled substances or prescription drugs present in the mother's body as a result of medical treatment administered to the mother, and the birth mother is the biological mother of at least one other child who was adjudicated an abused or neglected minor by the mother or the mother has previously failed to complete recommended treatment services by the children's division through a family-centered services case;\n\nc. If the parent is the birth mother and at the time of the child's birth or within eight hours after a child's birth the child tested positive for alcohol, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, a controlled substance as defined in section 195.010, or a prescription drug as defined in section 196.973, excepting those controlled substances or prescription drugs present in the mother's body as a result of medical treatment administered to the mother, and the birth mother is the biological mother of at least one other child who was adjudicated an abused or neglected minor by the mother or the mother has previously failed to complete recommended treatment services by the children's division through a family-centered services case;\n\nd. Within a three-year period immediately prior to the termination adjudication, the parent has pled guilty to or has been convicted of a felony involving the possession, distribution, or manufacture of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine, and the parent is the biological parent of at least one other child who was adjudicated an abused or neglected minor by such parent or such parent has previously failed to complete recommended treatment services by the children's division through a family-centered services case; or\n\ne. For at least fifteen of the twenty-two months prior to the filing of the petition, the child has been in foster care under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\n\n6. The juvenile court may terminate the rights of a parent to a child upon a petition filed by the juvenile officer or the division, or in adoption cases, by a prospective parent, if the court finds that the termination is in the best interest of the child and when it appears by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that grounds exist for termination pursuant to subsection 2, 4 or 5 of this section.\n\n7. When considering whether to terminate the parent-child relationship pursuant to subsection 2 or 4 of this section or subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of subsection 5 of this section, the court shall evaluate and make findings on the following factors, when appropriate and applicable to the case:\n\n(1) The emotional ties to the birth parent;\n\n(2) The extent to which the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with the child;\n\n(3) The extent of payment by the parent for the cost of care and maintenance of the child when financially able to do so including the time that the child is in the custody of the division or other child-placing agency;\n\n(4) Whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent within an ascertainable period of time;\n\n(5) The parent's disinterest in or lack of commitment to the child;\n\n(6) The conviction of the parent of a felony offense that the court finds is of such a nature that the child will be deprived of a stable home for a period of years; provided, however, that incarceration in and of itself shall not be grounds for termination of parental rights;\n\n(7) Deliberate acts of the parent or acts of another of which the parent knew or should have known that subjects the child to a substantial risk of physical or mental harm.\n\n8. The court may attach little or no weight to infrequent visitations, communications, or contributions. It is irrelevant in a termination proceeding that the maintenance of the parent-child relationship may serve as an inducement for the parent's rehabilitation.\n\n9. In actions for adoption pursuant to chapter 453, the court may hear and determine the issues raised in a petition for adoption containing a prayer for termination of parental rights filed with the same effect as a petition permitted pursuant to subsection 2, 4, or 5 of this section.\n\n10. The disability or disease of a parent shall not constitute a basis for a determination that a child is a child in need of care, for the removal of custody of a child from the parent, or for the termination of parental rights without a specific showing that there is a causal relation between the disability or disease and harm to the child.\n\n11. A court of competent jurisdiction may terminate the parental rights of a biological father of a child if he is an alleged perpetrator of forcible rape under section 566.030 as it existed prior to August 28, 2013, or rape in the first degree under section 566.030 that resulted in the conception and birth of the child. The biological mother who is the victim of the forcible rape or rape in the first degree or, if she is a minor, someone on her behalf may file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the biological father. The court may terminate the parental rights of the biological father if the court finds that by:\n\n(1) Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the biological father committed the act of forcible rape or rape in the first degree against the biological mother;\n\n(2) Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the child was conceived as a result of that act of forcible rape or rape in the first degree; and\n\n(3) The preponderance of the evidence the termination of the parental rights of the biological father is in the best interests of the child.\n\n12. In any action to terminate the parental rights of the biological father under subsection 11 of this section or subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section, a court of competent jurisdiction may order that the mother and the child conceived and born as a result of forcible rape or rape in the first degree are entitled to obtain from the biological father certain payments, support, beneficiary designations, or other financial benefits. The court shall issue such order only if the mother gives her consent; provided, that the court shall first inform the mother that such order may require or obligate the mother to have continuous or future communication and contact with the biological father. Such order shall be issued without the biological father being entitled to or granted any custody, guardianship, visitation privileges, or other parent-child relationship, and may include any or all of the following:\n\n(1) Payment for the reasonable expenses of the mother or the child, or both, related to pregnancy, labor, delivery, postpartum care, newborn care, or early childhood care;\n\n(2) Child support under this chapter or chapter 210, 452, or 454;\n\n(3) All rights of the child to inherit under the probate code, as defined in section 472.010; provided that, for purposes of intestate succession, the biological father or his kindred shall have no right to inherit from or through the child;\n\n(4) The designation of the child as the beneficiary of a life or accidental death insurance policy, annuity, contract, plan, or other product sold or issued by a life insurance company; or\n\n(5) Any other payments, support, beneficiary designations, or financial benefits that are in the best interests of the child or for the reasonable expenses of the mother, or both.\n\n­­If the mother declines to seek a court order for child support under this subsection, no state agency shall require the mother to do so in order to receive public assistance benefits for herself or the child, including, but not limited to, benefits for temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental nutrition assistance program, or MO HealthNet. The court order terminating the parental rights of the biological father under subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section or subsection 11 of this section shall serve as a sufficient basis for a good cause or other exemptions under 42 U.S.C. Section 654(29) and the state agency shall not require the mother or the child to otherwise provide the identity, location, income, or assets of the biological father or have contact or communicate with the biological father. However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a state agency from requesting that the mother assign any child support rights she receives under this subsection to the state as a condition of receipt of public assistance benefits under applicable federal and state law.\n\n(L. 1978 H.B. 972 § 2, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1171, et al., A.L. 1985 H.B. 366, et al., A.L. 1990 H.B. 1370, et al., A.L. 1997 H.B. 343, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1822 merged with S.B. 674, A.L. 2007 S.B. 84, A.L. 2011 H.B. 555 merged with H.B. 604 merged with H.B. 648, A.L. 2013 H.B. 215 merged with S.B. 256, A.L. 2014 S.B. 530, A.L. 2017 S.B. 160, A.L. 2018 S.B. 800 merged with S.B. 819 merged with S.B. 975 & 1024 Revision, A.L. 2021 H.B. 429)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nApplication of law to adoption petitions filed on or after August 28, 1997, 453.012",

Order of termination, when issued — transfer of legal custody, to whom — alternatives to termination — power of court — granting or denial of petition deemed final judgment. —1. If, after the dispositional hearing, the court finds that one or more of the grounds set out in section 211.447 exists or that the parent has consented to the termination pursuant to section 211.444 and that it is in the best interests of the child, the court may terminate the rights of the parent in and to the child. After ordering termination and after consideration of the social study and report, the court shall transfer legal custody to:\n\n(1) The children's division;\n\n(2) A private child-placing agency;\n\n(3) A foster parent, relative or other person participating in the proceedings pursuant to section 211.464; or\n\n(4) Any other person or agency the court deems suitable to care for the child.\n\n2. If only one parent consents or if the conditions specified in section 211.447 are found to exist as to only one parent, the rights of only that parent with reference to the child may be terminated and the rights of the other parent shall not be affected.\n\n3. The court may order termination whether or not the child is in adoptive placement or an adoptive placement is available for the child.\n\n4. If, after the dispositional hearing, the court finds that one or more of the grounds set out in section 211.447 exists, but that termination is not in the best interests of the child because the court finds that the child would benefit from the continued parent-child relationship or because the child is fourteen or more years of age and objects to the termination, the court may:\n\n(1) Dismiss the petition and order that the child be returned to the custody of the parent;\n\n(2) Retain jurisdiction of the case and order that the child be placed in the legal custody of the parent, the division, a private child-caring or placing agency, a foster parent, relative or other suitable person who is able to provide long-term care for the child. Any order of the court under this subdivision shall designate the period of time it shall remain in effect, with mandatory review by the court no later than six months thereafter. The court shall also specify what residual rights and responsibilities remain with the parent.
