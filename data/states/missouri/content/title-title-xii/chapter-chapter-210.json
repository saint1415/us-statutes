Policy of state, system principles — evaluation tool — response and evaluation team, duties — children's services providers and agencies, contracting with, requirements, payments — rulemaking authority — immunity from liability in contracts are void. —1. It is the policy of this state and its agencies to implement a foster care and child protection and welfare system focused on providing the highest quality of services and outcomes for children and their families. The department of social services shall implement such system subject to the following principles:\n\n(1) The safety and welfare of children is paramount;\n\n(2) All providers of direct services to children and their families will be evaluated in a uniform, transparent, objective, and consistent basis based on an evaluation tool established in this section;\n\n(3) Services to children and their families shall be provided in a timely manner to maximize the opportunity for successful outcomes, and such services shall be tracked and routinely evaluated through a quality assurance program;\n\n(4) Any provider of direct services to children and families shall have the appropriate and relevant training, education, and expertise to provide the highest quality of services possible which shall be consistent with federal and state standards;\n\n(5) Resources and efforts shall be committed to pursue the best possible opportunity for a successful outcome for each child. Successful outcomes may include preparing youth for a productive and successful life as an adult outside the foster care system, such as independent living. For those providers that work with children requiring intensive twenty-four-hour treatment services, successful outcomes shall be based on the least restrictive alternative possible based on the child's needs as well as the quality of care received; and\n\n(6) All service providers shall prioritize methods of reducing or eliminating a child's need for residential treatment through community-based services and supports.\n\n2. (1) In conjunction with the response and evaluation team established under subsection 3 of this section, as well as other individuals the division deems appropriate, the division shall establish an evaluation tool that complies with state and federal guidelines.\n\n(2) The evaluation tool shall include metrics supporting best practices for case management and service provision including, but not limited to, the frequency of face-to-face visits with the child.\n\n(3) There shall be a mechanism whereby providers may propose different evaluation metrics on a case-by-case basis if such case may have circumstances far beyond those that would be expected. Such cases shall be evaluated by the response and evaluation team under subsection 3 of this section.\n\n(4) Data regarding all evaluation metrics shall be collected by the division on a monthly basis, and the division shall issue a quarterly report regarding the evaluation data for each provider, both public and private, by county. The response and evaluation team shall determine how to aggregate cases for the division and large contractors so that performance and outcomes may be compared effectively while also protecting confidentiality. Such reports shall be made public and shall include information by county.\n\n(5) The standards and metrics developed through this evaluation tool shall be used to evaluate competitive bids for future contracts established under subsection 4 of this section.\n\n3. The division shall create a response and evaluation team. Membership of the team shall be composed of five staff members from the division with experience in foster care appointed by the director of the division; five representatives, one from each contract region for foster care case management contracts under this section, who shall be annually rotated among contractors in each region, which shall appoint the agency; two experts working in either research or higher education on issues relating to child welfare and foster care appointed by the director of the division and who shall be actively working for either an academic institution or policy foundation; one juvenile officer or a Missouri juvenile justice director to be appointed by the Missouri Juvenile Justice Association; and one juvenile or family court judge appointed by the supreme court. The division shall provide the necessary staffing for the team's operations. All members shall be appointed and the team shall meet for the first time before January 1, 2021. The team shall:\n\n(1) Review the evaluation tool and metrics set forth in subsection 2 of this section on a semiannual basis to determine any adjustments needed or issues that could affect the quality of such tools and approve or deny on a case-by-case basis:\n\n(a) Cases that a provider feels are anomalous and should not be part of developing the case management tool under subsection 2 of this section;\n\n(b) Alternative evaluation metrics recommended by providers based on the best interests of the child under subsections 2 and 5 of this section; or\n\n(c) Review and recommend any structure for incentives or other reimbursement strategies under subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(2) Develop and execute periodic provider evaluations of cases managed by the division and children service providers contracted with the state to provide foster care case management services, in the field under the evaluation tool created under subsection 2 of this section to ensure basic requirements of the program are met, which shall include, but are not limited to, random file review to ensure documentation shows required visits and case management plan notes; and\n\n(3) Develop a system for reviewing and working with providers identified under subdivision (2) of this subsection or providers who request such assistance from the division who show signs of performance weakness to ensure technical assistance and other services are offered to assist the providers in achieving successful outcomes for their cases.\n\n4. The children's division and any other state agency deemed necessary by the division shall, in consultation with service providers and other relevant parties, enter into and implement contracts with qualified children's services providers and agencies to provide a comprehensive and deliberate system of service delivery for children and their families. Contracts shall be awarded through a competitive process and provided by qualified public and private not-for-profit or limited liability corporations owned exclusively by not-for-profit corporations children's services providers and agencies which have:\n\n(1) A proven record of providing child welfare services within the state of Missouri which shall be consistent with the federal standards, but not less than the standards and policies used by the children's division as of January 1, 2004; and\n\n(2) The ability to provide a range of child welfare services including, but not limited to, case management services, family-centered services, foster and adoptive parent recruitment and retention, residential care, in-home services, foster care services, adoption services, relative care case management, planned permanent living services, and family reunification services.\n\n­­No contracts under this section shall be issued for services related to the child abuse and neglect hotline, investigations of alleged abuse and neglect, and initial family assessments. Any contracts entered into by the division shall be in accordance with all federal laws and regulations, and shall seek to maximize federal funding. Children's services providers and agencies under contract with the division shall be subject to all federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the provision of such services, and shall be subject to oversight and inspection by appropriate state agencies to assure compliance with standards which shall be consistent with the federal standards.\n\n5. The division shall accept as prima facie evidence of completion of the requirements for licensure under sections 210.481 to 210.511 proof that an agency is accredited by any of the following nationally recognized bodies: the Council on Accreditation of Services, Children and Families, Inc.; the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities.\n\n6. Payment to the children's services providers and agencies shall be made based on the reasonable costs of services, including responsibilities necessary to execute the contract. Any reimbursement increases made through enhanced appropriations for services shall be allocated to providers regardless of whether the provider is public or private. Such increases shall be considered additive to the existing contracts. In addition to payments reflecting the cost of services, contracts shall include incentives provided in recognition of performance based on the evaluation tool created under subsection 2 of this section and the corresponding savings for the state. The response and evaluation team under subsection 3 of this section shall review a formula to distribute such payments, as recommended by the division.\n\n7. The division shall consider immediate actions that are in the best interests of the children served including, but not limited to, placing the agency on a corrective plan, halting new referrals, transferring cases to other performing providers, or terminating the provider's contract. The division shall take steps necessary to evaluate the nature of the issue and act accordingly in the most timely fashion possible.\n\n8. By July 1, 2021, the children's division shall promulgate and have in effect rules to implement the provisions of this section and, pursuant to this section, shall define implementation plans and dates. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2004, shall be invalid and void.\n\n9. A provision in a service provider contract in which the state is indemnified, held harmless, or insured for damages, claims, losses, or expenses arising from any injury, including, but not limited to, bodily injury, mental anguish, property damage, or economic or noneconomic damages or loss caused by or resulting from the state's negligence, in whole or in part, shall be void as against public policy and unenforceable.

In addition to those persons and officials required to report actual or suspected abuse or neglect, any other person may report in accordance with sections 210.109 to 210.183 if such person has reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been or may be subjected to abuse or neglect or observes a child being subjected to conditions or circumstances which would reasonably result in abuse or neglect.\n\n6. Any person or official required to report pursuant to this section, including employees of the division, who has probable cause to suspect that a child who is or may be under the age of eighteen, who is eligible to receive a certificate of live birth, has died shall report that fact to the appropriate medical examiner or coroner. If, upon review of the circumstances and medical information, the medical examiner or coroner determines that the child died of natural causes while under medical care for an established natural disease, the coroner, medical examiner or physician shall notify the division of the child's death and that the child's attending physician shall be signing the death certificate. In all other cases, the medical examiner or coroner shall accept the report for investigation, shall immediately notify the division of the child's death as required in section 58.452 and shall report the findings to the child fatality review panel established pursuant to section 210.192.\n\n7. Any person or individual required to report may also report the suspicion of abuse or neglect to any law enforcement agency or juvenile office. Such report shall not, however, take the place of reporting to the division.\n\n8. If an individual required to report suspected instances of abuse or neglect pursuant to this section has reason to believe that the victim of such abuse or neglect is a resident of another state or was injured as a result of an act which occurred in another state, the person required to report such abuse or neglect may, in lieu of reporting to the Missouri children's division, make such a report to the child protection agency of the other state with the authority to receive such reports pursuant to the laws of such other state. If such agency accepts the report, no report is required to be made, but may be made, to the children's division.\n\n9. For the purposes of providing supportive services or verifying the status of a youth as unaccompanied or homeless for the purposes of accessing supportive services, the fact that a child is an unaccompanied youth as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 11434a(6) is not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or neglect, unless the child is under sixteen years of age or is an incapacitated person, as defined in section 475.010. Nothing in this subsection shall limit a mandated reporter from making a report under this section if the mandated reporter knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that an unaccompanied youth has been or may be a victim of abuse or neglect.\n\n(L. 1975 H.B. 578 § 2, A.L. 1980 S.B. 574, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1171, et al., A.L. 1991 H.B. 185, A.L. 1993 S.B. 253 merged with S.B. 394, A.L. 1994 S.B. 595, A.L. 1998 H.B. 1556, A.L. 2000 S.B. 757 & 602, A.L. 2002 S.B. 923, et al., A.L. 2003 H.B. 445, A.L. 2013 H.B. 505, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision, A.L. 2018 S.B. 819, A.L. 2021 H.B. 432)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nChild abuse, ministers duty to report, 352.400\n\n(1986) It has been held that a violation of this section does not give rise to a private cause of action.

The agreement shall be reduced to writing within three business days. The written agreement shall be signed by the parent or guardian, the relative, and the authorized representative of the division. A temporary alternative placement agreement shall be valid for no more than ninety days. If the agreement shall be extended beyond ninety days, then, before the expiration of the ninety-day period, the division shall send a referral to the juvenile officer to make a determination whether to file a petition, to set the matter for a preliminary child welfare hearing, or to take other appropriate action as the juvenile officer deems necessary.

As provided in this section, the division may enter into a temporary alternative placement agreement with parents and legal guardians of a minor child who cannot safely remain in the child's home on a temporary basis. The purpose of such agreement is to mitigate trauma to the child and to enable the division to make reasonable efforts to assure the safety of a child in a placement familiar to the child, and to give the child and the child's family an opportunity to develop and implement a plan to assure the stability and well-being of the child in the short term. The child shall reside in the state of Missouri for the duration of the temporary alternative placement agreement unless the child requires medical treatment in another state that is not reasonably available within the state of Missouri.\n\n3.

The agreement shall remain in effect until the termination of the agreement is effective.\n\n5. (1) The relative shall have the authority to make the day-to-day decisions for the care of the child during the agreement, as provided in the agreement, and shall further have the authority to make educational and medical decisions for the child as provided in this section.\n\n(2) The relative shall consult with the child's parents, legal guardian, and the division before making decisions pertaining to the child other than routine, day-to-day decisions necessary to care for the child.\n\n(3) The division shall provide a notice to the relative on a form promulgated by the division for use in notifying schools, medical care providers, and others that the suitable relative or adult has the temporary authority to make these decisions. Individuals and institutions, including schools and medical care providers, acting upon the authority of such notice shall be immune from liability for acting upon the authority as set forth in the notice*.\n\n6. (1) The division shall closely monitor, track, and document the implementation of the provisions of the temporary alternative placement agreement for the duration of the agreement.\n\n(2) The division shall have personal contact with the child as may be appropriate to ensure that the temporary alternative placement agreement is being safely implemented, but in no event less than two times each month.

The division shall provide a copy of the report to the placement provider and the child's parent or guardian. The report shall include a copy of the agreement, a specific description of the steps taken to complete the agreement, and a recommendation to the juvenile officer about whether further action may be necessary.\n\n7. If the parent or guardian does not agree to the temporary alternative placement agreement, the division shall refer the matter to the juvenile officer for appropriate action as determined by the juvenile officer.\n\n8. All parties to the temporary alternative care agreement shall exercise diligent efforts to implement the agreement. The suitable relative and the parents or guardians shall fully cooperate with the division.\n\n9. If the division determines that the goals of the temporary alternative placement agreement are not accomplished within the time period specified in the agreement and the safety or well-being of the child cannot be assured if the child were to return home, the division shall refer the case to the juvenile officer.\n\n10. A temporary alternative placement agreement may be executed in conjunction with the informal adjustment process through the juvenile office.\n\n11. The juvenile officer shall not be bound by the terms of a temporary alternative placement agreement, unless the juvenile officer is a signatory to the agreement, and the juvenile officer may exercise discretion to take appropriate action within the juvenile officer's authority under law.

A police officer, law enforcement official, or a physician who has reasonable cause to believe that a child is in imminent danger of suffering serious physical harm or a threat to life as a result of abuse or neglect and such person has reasonable cause to believe the harm or threat to life may occur before a juvenile court could issue a temporary protective custody order or before a juvenile officer could take the child into protective custody, the police officer, law enforcement official or physician may take or retain temporary protective custody of the child without the consent of the child's parents, guardian or others legally responsible for his care.\n\n3. Any person taking a child in protective custody under this section shall immediately notify the juvenile officer of the court of the county in which the child is located of his actions and notify the division and make a reasonable attempt to advise the parents, guardians or others legally responsible for the child's care.

The court shall enter an order under this section if:\n\n(1) The court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child has been abused or neglected and the residential care facility does not voluntarily provide access to the child;\n\n(2) The assessment is reasonably necessary for the completion of an investigation or the collection of evidence; and\n\n(3) Doing so is in the best interest of the child.\n\n3. The assessment shall be completed and the child shall be returned to the residential care facility or to the child's parents or guardian within seventy-two hours, unless the court, after a hearing with attempted notice to the facility and to the parents or guardian and with due process for all parties, enters further orders to the contrary.\n\n4. If the court enters an order to produce the child under this section, the court may expand the order to produce other children in the care of the residential care facility if the court finds there is reasonable cause to believe that such children may have been abused or neglected.\n\n5. The petition and order may be made on an ex parte basis if it is reasonable to believe that providing notice may place the child at risk for further abuse or neglect, if it is reasonable to believe that providing notice may cause the child to be removed from the state of Missouri or the jurisdiction of the court, or if it is reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to the investigation will be unavailable if the ex parte order is not entered.\n\n6. Any person served with a subpoena, petition, or order under this section shall not be required to file an answer, but may file a motion for a protective order or other appropriate relief. The motion shall be filed at or before the time for production or disclosure set out in the subpoena or order. The motion shall be in writing, but it may be informal and no particular form shall be required. The clerk shall serve a copy of the motion on the director of the children's division and any agency who applied for the order. The court shall expedite a hearing on the motion and shall issue its decision no later than one business day after the date the motion is filed. The court may review the motion in camera and stay implementation of the order once for up to three days. The in camera review shall be conducted on the record, but steps shall be taken to protect the identity of the child. Any information that may reveal the identity of a hotline reporter shall not be disclosed to anyone in any proceeding under this subsection unless otherwise allowed by law.\n\n7. The petition for an order under this section shall be filed in the juvenile or family court that has judicial custody of the child under section 211.031 or in the circuit court of the county:\n\n(1) Where the child resides;\n\n(2) Where the child may be found;\n\n(3) Where the residential care facility is located;\n\n(4) Where the alleged perpetrator of the child abuse or neglect resides or may be found;\n\n(5) Where the subject of the subpoena may be located or found; or\n\n(6) Of Cole if none of the other venue provisions of this subsection apply.\n\n8.

Telephone hotline for reports on child abuse — division duties, protocols, law enforcement contacted immediately, investigation conducted, when, exception — chief investigator named — family support team meetings, who may attend — reporter's right to receive information — admissibility of reports in custody cases. —1. The division shall develop protocols which give priority to:\n\n(1) Ensuring the well-being and safety of the child in instances where child abuse or neglect has been alleged;\n\n(2) Promoting the preservation and reunification of children and families consistent with state and federal law;\n\n(3) Providing due process for those accused of child abuse or neglect; and\n\n(4) Maintaining an information system operating at all times, capable of receiving and maintaining reports. This information system shall have the ability to receive reports over a single, statewide toll-free number. Such information system shall maintain the results of all investigations, family assessments and services, and other relevant information.\n\n2. (1) The division shall utilize structured decision-making protocols, including a standard risk assessment that shall be completed within seventy-two hours of the report of abuse or neglect, for classification purposes of all child abuse and neglect reports. The protocols developed by the division shall give priority to ensuring the well-being and safety of the child. All child abuse and neglect reports shall be initiated within twenty-four hours and shall be classified based upon the reported risk and injury to the child. The division shall promulgate rules regarding the structured decision-making protocols to be utilized for all child abuse and neglect reports.\n\n(2) The director of the division and the office of state courts administrator shall develop a joint safety assessment tool before December 31, 2020, and such tool shall be implemented before January 1, 2022. The safety assessment tool shall replace the standard risk assessment required under subdivision (1) of this subsection and shall also be completed within seventy-two hours of the report of abuse or neglect.\n\n3. Upon receipt of a report, the division shall determine if the report merits investigation, including reports which if true would constitute a suspected violation of any of the following: section 565.020, 565.021, 565.023, 565.024, or 565.050 if the victim is a child less than eighteen years of age, section 566.030 or 566.060 if the victim is a child less than eighteen years of age, or other crimes under chapter 566 if the victim is a child less than eighteen years of age and the perpetrator is twenty-one years of age or older, section 567.050 if the victim is a child less than eighteen years of age, section 568.020, 568.030, 568.045, 568.050, 568.060, 573.200, or 573.205, section 573.025, 573.035, 573.037, or 573.040, or an attempt to commit any such crimes. The division shall immediately communicate all reports that merit investigation to its appropriate local office and any relevant information as may be contained in the information system. The local division staff shall determine, through the use of protocols developed by the division, whether an investigation or the family assessment and services approach should be used to respond to the allegation. The protocols developed by the division shall give priority to ensuring the well-being and safety of the child.\n\n4. The division may accept a report for investigation or family assessment if either the child or alleged perpetrator resides in Missouri, may be found in Missouri, or if the incident occurred in Missouri.\n\n5. If the division receives a report in which neither the child nor the alleged perpetrator resides in Missouri or may be found in Missouri and the incident did not occur in Missouri, the division shall document the report and communicate it to the appropriate agency or agencies in the state where the child is believed to be located, along with any relevant information or records as may be contained in the division's information system.\n\n6. When the child abuse and neglect hotline receives three or more calls, within a seventy-two hour period, from one or more individuals concerning the same child, the division shall conduct a review to determine whether the calls meet the criteria and statutory definition for a child abuse and neglect report to be accepted. In conducting the review, the division shall contact the hotline caller or callers in order to collect information to determine whether the calls meet the criteria for harassment.\n\n7. The local office shall contact the appropriate law enforcement agency immediately upon receipt of a report which division personnel determine merits an investigation and provide such agency with a detailed description of the report received. In such cases the local division office shall request the assistance of the local law enforcement agency in all aspects of the investigation of the complaint. The appropriate law enforcement agency shall either assist the division in the investigation or provide the division, within twenty-four hours, an explanation in writing detailing the reasons why it is unable to assist.\n\n8. (1) The local office of the division shall cause an investigation or family assessment and services approach to be initiated in accordance with the protocols established in subsection 2 of this section, except in cases where the sole basis for the report is educational neglect. If the report indicates that educational neglect is the only complaint and there is no suspicion of other neglect or abuse, the investigation shall be initiated within seventy-two hours of receipt of the report. If the report indicates the child is in danger of serious physical harm or threat to life, an investigation shall include direct observation of the subject child within twenty-four hours of the receipt of the report. Local law enforcement shall take all necessary steps to facilitate such direct observation. Callers to the child abuse and neglect hotline shall be instructed by the division's hotline to call 911 in instances where the child may be in immediate danger. If the parents of the child are not the alleged perpetrators, a parent of the child must be notified prior to the child being interviewed by the division. No person responding to or investigating a child abuse and neglect report shall call prior to a home visit or leave any documentation of any attempted visit, such as business cards, pamphlets, or other similar identifying information if he or she has a reasonable basis to believe the following factors are present:\n\n(a) a. No person is present in the home at the time of the home visit; and\n\nb. The alleged perpetrator resides in the home or the physical safety of the child may be compromised if the alleged perpetrator becomes aware of the attempted visit;\n\n(b) The alleged perpetrator will be alerted regarding the attempted visit; or\n\n(c) The family has a history of domestic violence or fleeing the community.\n\n(2) If the division is responding to an investigation of abuse or neglect, the person responding shall first ensure safety of the child through direct observation and communication with the child. If the parent or alleged perpetrator is present during a visit by the person responding to or investigating the report, such person shall present identification and verbally identify himself or herself and his or her role in the investigation and shall provide written material to the parent or alleged perpetrator informing him or her of his or her rights regarding such visit, including but not limited to the right to contact an attorney. The parent or alleged perpetrator shall be given a reasonable amount of time to read such written material or have such material read to him or her by the case worker before the visit commences, but in no event shall such time exceed five minutes; except that, such requirement to provide written material and reasonable time to read such material shall not apply in cases where the child faces an immediate threat or danger, or the person responding to or investigating the report is or feels threatened or in danger of physical harm. If the abuse is alleged to have occurred in a school or child care facility the division shall not meet with the child in any school building or child care facility building where abuse of such child is alleged to have occurred. When the child is reported absent from the residence, the location and the well-being of the child shall be verified. For purposes of this subsection, child care facility shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in section 210.201.\n\n(3) If the division is responding to an assessment of abuse or neglect, the person responding shall present identification and verbally identify himself or herself and his or her role in the investigation and provide a parent of the child with notification prior to the child being interviewed by the person responding and shall provide written material to the parent informing him or her of his or her rights regarding such visit, including, but not limited to, the right to contact an attorney. The parent shall be given a reasonable amount of time to read such written material or have such material read to him or her by the case worker before the visit commences, but in no event shall such time exceed five minutes; except that, such requirement to provide written material and reasonable time to read such material shall not apply in cases where the child faces immediate threat or danger, the person responding to or investigating the report is or feels threatened or in danger of physical harm, or any of the exceptions in subdivision (1) of this subsection would apply.\n\n9. The director of the division shall name at least one chief investigator for each local division office, who shall direct the division response on any case involving a second or subsequent incident regarding the same subject child or perpetrator. The duties of a chief investigator shall include verification of direct observation of the subject child by the division and shall ensure information regarding the status of an investigation is provided to the public school district liaison. The public school district liaison shall develop protocol in conjunction with the chief investigator to ensure information regarding an investigation is shared with appropriate school personnel. The superintendent of each school district shall designate a specific person or persons to act as the public school district liaison. Should the subject child attend a nonpublic school the chief investigator shall notify the school principal of the investigation. Upon notification of an investigation, all information received by the public school district liaison or the school shall be subject to the provisions of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, and federal rule 34 C.F.R. Part 99.\n\n10. The investigation shall include but not be limited to the nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect; the identity and age of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect; the names and conditions of other children in the home, if any; the home environment and the relationship of the subject child to the parents or other persons responsible for the child's care; any indication of incidents of physical violence against any other household or family member; and other pertinent data.\n\n11. When a report has been made by a person required to report under section 210.115, the division shall contact the person who made such report within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the report in order to ensure that full information has been received and to obtain any additional information or medical records, or both, that may be pertinent.\n\n12. Upon completion of the investigation, if the division suspects that the report was made maliciously or for the purpose of harassment, the division shall refer the report and any evidence of malice or harassment to the local prosecuting or circuit attorney.\n\n13. Multidisciplinary teams shall be used whenever conducting the investigation as determined by the division in conjunction with local law enforcement. Multidisciplinary teams shall be used in providing protective or preventive social services, including the services of law enforcement, a liaison of the local public school, the juvenile officer, the juvenile court, and other agencies, both public and private.\n\n14. For all family support team meetings involving an alleged victim of child abuse or neglect, the parents, legal counsel for the parents, foster parents, the legal guardian or custodian of the child, the guardian ad litem for the child, the child's counsel, and the volunteer advocate for the child shall be provided notice and be permitted to attend all such meetings. Family members, other than alleged perpetrators, or other community informal or formal service providers that provide significant support to the child and other individuals may also be invited at the discretion of the parents of the child. In addition, the parents, the legal counsel for the parents, the legal guardian or custodian and the foster parents may request that other individuals, other than alleged perpetrators, be permitted to attend such team meetings. Once a person is provided notice of or attends such team meetings, the division or the convenor of the meeting shall provide such persons with notice of all such subsequent meetings involving the child. Families may determine whether individuals invited at their discretion shall continue to be invited.\n\n15. If the appropriate local division personnel determine after an investigation has begun that completing an investigation is not appropriate, the division shall conduct a family assessment and services approach. The division shall provide written notification to local law enforcement prior to terminating any investigative process. The reason for the termination of the investigative process shall be documented in the record of the division and the written notification submitted to local law enforcement. Such notification shall not preclude nor prevent any investigation by law enforcement.\n\n16. If the appropriate local division personnel determines to use a family assessment and services approach, the division shall:\n\n(1) Assess any service needs of the family. The assessment of risk and service needs shall be based on information gathered from the family and other sources;\n\n(2) Provide services which are voluntary and time-limited unless it is determined by the division based on the assessment of risk that there will be a high risk of abuse or neglect if the family refuses to accept the services. The division shall identify services for families where it is determined that the child is at high risk of future abuse or neglect. The division shall thoroughly document in the record its attempt to provide voluntary services and the reasons these services are important to reduce the risk of future abuse or neglect to the child. If the family continues to refuse voluntary services or the child needs to be protected, the division may commence an investigation;\n\n(3) Commence an immediate investigation if at any time during the family assessment and services approach the division determines that an investigation, as delineated in sections 210.109 to 210.183, is required. The division staff who have conducted the assessment may remain involved in the provision of services to the child and family;\n\n(4) Document at the time the case is closed, the outcome of the family assessment and services approach, any service provided and the removal of risk to the child, if it existed.\n\n17. (1) Within forty-five days of an oral report of abuse or neglect, the local office shall update the information in the information system. The information system shall contain, at a minimum, the determination made by the division as a result of the investigation, identifying information on the subjects of the report, those responsible for the care of the subject child and other relevant dispositional information. The division shall complete all investigations within forty-five days, unless good cause for the failure to complete the investigation is specifically documented in the information system. Good cause for failure to complete an investigation shall include, but not be limited to:\n\n(a) The necessity to obtain relevant reports of medical providers, medical examiners, psychological testing, law enforcement agencies, forensic testing, and analysis of relevant evidence by third parties which has not been completed and provided to the division;\n\n(b) The attorney general or the prosecuting or circuit attorney of the city or county in which a criminal investigation is pending certifies in writing to the division that there is a pending criminal investigation of the incident under investigation by the division and the issuing of a decision by the division will adversely impact the progress of the investigation; or\n\n(c) The child victim, the subject of the investigation or another witness with information relevant to the investigation is unable or temporarily unwilling to provide complete information within the specified time frames due to illness, injury, unavailability, mental capacity, age, developmental disability, or other cause.\n\n­­The division shall document any such reasons for failure to complete the investigation.\n\n(2) If a child fatality or near-fatality is involved in a report of abuse or neglect, the investigation shall remain open until the division's investigation surrounding such death or near-fatal injury is completed.\n\n(3) If the investigation is not completed within forty-five days, the information system shall be updated at regular intervals and upon the completion of the investigation, which shall be completed no later than ninety days after receipt of a report of abuse or neglect, or one hundred twenty days after receipt of a report of abuse or neglect involving sexual abuse, or until the division's investigation is complete in cases involving a child fatality or near-fatality. The information in the information system shall be updated to reflect any subsequent findings, including any changes to the findings based on an administrative or judicial hearing on the matter.\n\n18. A person required to report under section 210.115 to the division and any person making a report of child abuse or neglect made to the division which is not made anonymously shall be informed by the division of his or her right to obtain information concerning the disposition of his or her report. Such person shall receive, from the local office, if requested, information on the general disposition of his or her report. Such person may receive, if requested, findings and information concerning the case. Such release of information shall be at the discretion of the director based upon a review of the reporter's ability to assist in protecting the child or the potential harm to the child or other children within the family. The local office shall respond to the request within forty-five days. The findings shall be made available to the reporter within five days of the outcome of the investigation. If the report is determined to be unsubstantiated, the reporter may request that the report be referred by the division to the office of child advocate for children's protection and services established in sections 37.700 to 37.730. Upon request by a reporter under this subsection, the division shall refer an unsubstantiated report of child abuse or neglect to the office of child advocate for children's protection and services.\n\n19.

In any judicial proceeding involving the custody of a child the fact that a report may have been made pursuant to sections 210.109 to 210.183 shall not be admissible. However:\n\n(1) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the introduction of evidence from independent sources to support the allegations that may have caused a report to have been made; and\n\n(2) The court may on its own motion, or shall if requested by a party to the proceeding, make an inquiry not on the record with the children's division to determine if such a report has been made.\n\n­­If a report has been made, the court may stay the custody proceeding until the children's division completes its investigation.\n\n21. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the children's division from coinvestigating a report of child abuse or neglect or sharing records and information with child welfare, law enforcement, or judicial officers of another state, territory, or nation if the children's division determines it is appropriate to do so under the standard set forth in subsection 4 of section 210.150 and if such receiving agency is exercising its authority under the law.\n\n22. In any judicial proceeding involving the custody of a child where the court determines that the child is in need of services under paragraph (d) of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 211.031 and has taken jurisdiction, the child's parent, guardian or custodian shall not be entered into the registry.\n\n23. The children's division is hereby granted the authority to promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the provisions of section 207.021 and chapter 536 to carry out the provisions of sections 210.109 to 210.183.\n\n24.

This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2000, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1975 H.B. 578 § 8, A.L. 1980 S.B. 574, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1171, et al., A.L. 1986 S.B. 470, A.L. 1990 H.B. 1370, et al., A.L. 1993 S.B. 52, A.L. 1994 S.B. 595, A.L. 2000 S.B. 757 & 602, A.L. 2002 S.B. 923, et al., A.L. 2003 H.B. 613, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1453 merged with S.B. 945 and S.B. 803 & 1257 merged with S.B. 968 and S.B. 969, A.L. 2007 S.B. 25, A.L. 2011 S.B. 54, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1323, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1092 merged with S.B. 869, A.L. 2018 S.B. 819, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1414 merged with S.B. 653, A.L. 2025 H.B. 737 & 486 merged with S.B. 43)",

The burden of proof at any appeal of a disapproval of a variance application shall be with the department of elementary and secondary education. Local inspectors may grant a variance, subject to approval by the department of elementary and secondary education.\n\n4. The department shall deny, suspend, place on probation or revoke a license if it receives official written notice that the local governing body has found that license is prohibited by any local law related to the health and safety of children.

Any person who operates an unlicensed, nonexempt child-care facility in violation of the provisions of sections 210.201 to 210.245 shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars and not more than two thousand dollars. The department shall serve upon such person written notice of the department's findings as to the child-care facility's unlicensed, nonexempt status, along with educational materials about Missouri's child-care facility laws and regulations, how a facility may become exempt or licensed, and penalties for operating an unlicensed, nonexempt child-care facility. The notice shall contain a statement that the person shall have thirty days to become compliant with sections 210.201 to 210.245, including attaining exempt status or becoming licensed. The person's failure to do so shall result in a civil action in the circuit court of Cole County or criminal charges under this section. If, following the receipt of the written notice, the person operating the child-care facility fails to become compliant with sections 210.201 to 210.245, the department may bring a civil action in the circuit court of Cole County against such person. The department may, but shall not be required to, request that the attorney general bring the action in place of the department. No civil action provided by this subsection shall be brought if the criminal penalties under subsection 1 of this section have been previously ordered against the person for the same violation. Failure by the department to file suit under the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as creating any liability in tort or incurring other obligations or duties except as otherwise specified.\n\n8. There shall be established the \"Family Child Care Provider Fund\" in the state treasury, which shall consist of such funds as appropriated by the general assembly. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund and moneys in the fund shall be used solely by the department for the dissemination of information concerning compliance with child-care facility laws and regulations, including licensed or exempt status; educational initiatives relating to, inter alia, child care, safe sleep practices, and child nutrition; and the provision of financial assistance on the basis of need for family child-care homes to become licensed, as determined by the department and subject to available moneys in the fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the general revenue fund. The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 685, A.L. 1993 H.B. 376, A.L. 1999 H.B. 490 & H.B. 308, A.L. 2012 H.B. 1323, A.L. 2019 H.B. 397, A.L. 2022 S.B. 683)",

All grandparents or relatives to the child identified in a diligent search required by this section, subject to exceptions due to family or domestic violence or other safety concerns, shall be provided with notice, via certified mail as appropriate, that includes, but is not limited to:\n\n(1) A specification that an alleged dependent child has been or is being removed from his or her parental custody;\n\n(2) An explanation of the options a grandparent or relative has to participate in the care and placement of the alleged dependent child and any options that may be lost by failing to respond to the notice;\n\n(3) A description of the process for becoming a licensed foster family home and the additional services and supports available for children placed in approved foster homes;\n\n(4) A description of any financial assistance for which a grandparent or relative may be eligible; and\n\n(5) An explanation that any response received after thirty days or willful failure to respond upon receiving a notice may result in the grandparent or relative of the child not being considered for placement.\n\n7.

The county commission or other legislative authority in any such county, or the circuit judges en banc in any first class county with the greater part of a city of three hundred fifty thousand or more population, shall make all rules and regulations for the government of such places of detention, make a budget for operations, appoint officers and attendants, including teachers, prescribe their duties and fix their compensation. The expense of maintaining such place of detention, including the compensation of officers and employees thereof, shall be paid out of any funds available for the purpose, as the county commission deems proper; except, that no portion of the special road fund shall be appropriated for this purpose.\n\n2. In any first class county with the greater part of a city of three hundred fifty thousand or more population, to defray in whole or in part the expenses of such places of detention and any other children's services, the county commission or other legislative authority is hereby authorized to impose a tax on the sale of cigarettes made of tobacco or any substitute for tobacco, not to exceed two and one-half mills per cigarette sold in the county.\n\n3. The rate of taxation shall not be greater than the amount required for children's services.\n\n4. The county cigarette tax shall be collected by the state department of revenue in the same manner as is provided by chapter 149 for the collection of the state cigarette tax. The director of revenue shall retain, from the county tax collected, one percent of the amount collected and deposit that amount in the state general revenue fund to help defray the cost to the state of collecting and distributing this tax.\n\n5. The county tax shall be paid, county stamps or meter impressions shall be affixed, records covering the business carried on in any county adopting the tax herein provided shall be kept in Missouri, records shall be subject to the examination of any authorized representative of the director, and reports covering the county tax required by the director shall be filed in the same manner as is provided by chapter 149 for the state cigarette tax; except, that the payment of the county tax shall not be deferred and a two percent discount shall be given any wholesaler for affixing stamps or making reports required by the director.\n\n6.

If after any audit, examination of records or other investigation the director finds that any person has sold cigarettes in any county adopting the cigarette tax herein provided, without county stamps or meter impressions affixed thereto or that any person has failed to pay the county tax on cigarettes sold in such counties, the director shall assess such county tax against such person, together with a penalty equal to one hundred percent of the county tax due and the tax and penalty thereon shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the date such cigarettes were sold in such county until the date of payment. The county taxes and penalties assessed under this section shall be a first lien on all property and assets of such person within this state.\n\n8. No person, other than licensed wholesalers or other persons specifically provided for in chapter 149, shall possess for the purpose of sale in any county adopting the tax herein provided, any cigarettes to which stamps or meter impressions evidencing the county tax are not affixed. Mere possession of unstamped packages of such cigarettes shall be prima facie evidence that the cigarettes are intended for sale in such county.\n\n9. All cigarettes to which county stamps or meter impressions are not affixed which shall be found in the possession, custody, or control of any person, for the purpose of being consumed, sold or transported into, within or through any county adopting the tax herein provided, for the purpose of evading the provision of this section, or with intent to avoid payment of the county tax authorized hereunder, and any motor vehicle, truck or other conveyance whatsoever used in the transportation of such cigarettes, and all paraphernalia, equipment or other tangible personal property incident to the use of such purposes, found in the place, building, vehicle, or vehicles where the cigarettes are found may be seized by the director or his duly authorized agents, or any peace officer within the state, and the same shall be, from the time of the seizure, forfeited to the county of seizure and a proper proceeding filed in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county of seizure, to maintain the seizure and prosecute the forfeiture in the same manner as is provided by section 149.055 for the state cigarette tax.\n\n10. The director of revenue of this state shall promulgate reasonable and necessary regulations for the collection of this tax. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated under the authority of this section shall become effective unless it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions of section 536.024.\n\n11. Any person who commits any act or omission with regard to cigarettes sold or intended to be sold in any county adopting the tax herein provided; or with relation to stamps applied or intended to be applied to cigarettes for sale in any such county, or with respect to records, reports, or returns of sales made taxable under this section; which if done with regard to cigarettes made taxable under chapter 149, or stamps or records prescribed thereunder, would be a violation of said chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished as provided by law.\n\n12. The budget for the operation of such places of detention shall be fixed by the circuit judges en banc in counties of the first class with the greater part of a city of three hundred fifty thousand or more population.

Money held by others for benefit of a child, definitions, liability to the state for funds expended for child, when — money held by division for a child, accounting, deposit of funds, annual statement, disposal of funds — escheat, when. —1. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Child\", any child or youth placed in the legal custody of the division under chapter 211;\n\n(2)\"Division\", the children's division of the department of social services of the state of Missouri;\n\n(3)\"Money\", any legal tender, note, draft, certificate of deposit, stocks, bond or check;\n\n(4)\"Unmet needs\", needs for which the division is not required by law to provide financial support, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(a) Tuition, tutoring, and training, including application fees, books, equipment, and testing;\n\n(b) Transportation to and from work, training, education, or to maintain family connections;\n\n(c) Housing expenses if the child is preparing to leave the custody of the division for reasons relating to the child's age; and\n\n(d) Technology, special clothing needs, instruments, books, and other equipment relating to the child's hobbies and interests;\n\n(5)\"Vested right\", a legal right that is more than a mere expectancy and may be reduced to a present monetary value;\n\n(6)\"Youth\", any child under the legal custody of the division where jurisdiction has been granted under section 211.041.\n\n2. The child, the child's parents, any fiduciary or any representative payee holding or receiving money that are vested rights solely for or on behalf of a child are jointly and severally liable for funds expended by the division to or on behalf of the child. The liability of any person, except a parent of the child, shall be limited to the money received in his or her fiduciary or representative capacity. The Missouri state government shall not require a trustee or a financial institution acting as a trustee to exercise any discretionary powers in the operation of a trust.\n\n3. (1) The division may accept an appointment to serve as representative payee or fiduciary, or in a similar capacity for payments to a child under any public or private benefit arrangement. Money so received shall be governed by this section to the extent that laws and regulations governing payment of such benefits provide otherwise.\n\n(2) In the case of benefits administered by the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, the Social Security Administration, or the Veterans Administration, the division shall determine whether the child is receiving or otherwise eligible to receive such benefits within sixty days after the child is placed in the division's custody. If the division determines that the child is eligible or may be eligible for the benefits, the division shall apply for the benefits on behalf of the child. If the child is already receiving the benefits before being placed in the division's custody or if the division applies for the benefits on behalf of the child, the division shall identify, in consultation with the child and the child's guardian ad litem, a representative payee in accordance with 20 CFR 404.2021 and 20 CFR 416.621 and shall apply to become the representative payee only if no other suitable candidate is available. The division shall annually review if someone other than the division is available, if in the best interests of the child, to apply to assume the role of representative payee.\n\n(3) The division shall annually review cases of children in the division's custody to determine whether a child may have become eligible for benefits after the division's initial assessment.\n\n4. Any money received by the division on behalf of a child shall be accounted for in the name of the child. Any money in the account of a child shall not be expended by the division for care or services for the child including, but not limited to, foster care maintenance payments, as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 675(4)(A), and any special allowances or expenses established by the division for the care of children in the division's custody for a child of a similar age; provided, however, that the division may use the benefits administered by the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, the Social Security Administration, or the Veterans Administration for the child's unmet needs beyond what the division is obligated, required, or agrees to pay. The division shall by rule adopted under chapter 536 establish procedures for the accounting of the money and the protection of the money against theft, loss or misappropriation.\n\n5. The division shall deposit money with a financial institution. Any earnings attributable to the money in the account of a child shall be credited to that child's account. The division shall receive bids from banking corporations, associations or trust companies which desire to be selected as depositories of children's moneys for the division. The child's account shall be established in a manner consistent with federal and state asset and resource limits and may include a special needs trust, a pooled special needs trust, an ABLE account as defined in section 209.600, or any other trust account determined not to interfere with asset limitations for any state or federal benefit program for which the child may be eligible.\n\n6. The division may accept funds which a parent, guardian or other person wishes to provide for the use or benefit of the child. The use and deposit of such funds shall be governed by this section and any additional directions given by the provider of the funds.\n\n7. Each child for whose benefit funds have been received by the division, the guardian ad litem of such child, and the child's counsel shall be furnished annually with a statement listing all transactions involving the funds which have been deposited on the child's behalf, to include each receipt and disbursement.\n\n8. The division shall use all proper diligence to dispose of the balance of money accumulated in the child's account when the child is released from the care and custody of the division or the child dies. When the child is deceased the balance shall be disposed of as provided by law for descent and distribution. If, after the division has diligently used such methods and means as considered reasonable to refund such funds, there shall remain any money, the owner of which is unknown to the division, or if known, cannot be located by the division, in each and every such instance such money shall escheat and vest in the state of Missouri, and the director and officials of the division shall pay the same to the state director of the department of revenue, taking a receipt therefor, who shall deposit the money in the state treasury to be credited to a fund to be designated as \"escheat\".\n\n9. Within five years after money has been paid into the state treasury, any person who appears and claims the money may file a petition in the circuit court of Cole County, Missouri, stating the nature of the claim and praying that such money be paid to him. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the director of the department of revenue who shall file an answer to the same. The court shall proceed to examine the claim and the allegations and proof, and if it finds that such person is entitled to any money so paid into the state treasury, it shall order the commissioner of administration to issue a warrant on the state treasurer for the amount of such claim, but without interest or costs. A certified copy of the order shall be sufficient voucher for issuing a warrant; provided, that either party may appeal from the decision of the court in the same manner as provided by law in other civil actions.\n\n10. All moneys paid into the state treasury under the provisions of this section after remaining there unclaimed for five years shall escheat and vest absolutely in the state and be credited to the state treasury, and all persons shall be forever barred and precluded from setting up title or claim to any such funds.\n\n11. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to funds regularly due the state of Missouri for the support and maintenance of children in the care and custody of the division or collected by the state of Missouri as reimbursement for state funds expended on behalf of the child.\n\n12. (1) Subject to appropriation, the department of social services shall have the authority to enter into contracts with private individuals, law firms, not-for-profit corporations, or partnerships to apply for benefits on behalf of a child in its custody or under its court-ordered supervision pursuant to chapter 211 for the benefits administered by the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, the Social Security Administration, or the Veterans Administration, and to establish accounts as set forth in subsection 5 of this section.\n\n(2) The department may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2025, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 244 § 4, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision, A.L. 2025 H.B. 737 & 486 merged with S.B. 43)",

This section shall be known and may be cited as the \"Foster Care Bill of Rights\".\n\n2. The children's division shall provide every school-aged foster child and his or her foster parent with an age-appropriate orientation and explanation of the foster care bill of rights. Any children's division office, residential care facility, child placing agency, or other agency involved in the care and placement of foster children shall post the foster care bill of rights in the office, facility, or agency. The children's division shall also make the foster care bill of rights readily available and easily accessible online.\n\n3. The foster care bill of rights shall be as follows:\n\n(1) In all circumstances, the best interests of the child shall be the first priority of the children's division;\n\n(2) Recognizing the importance of familial stability in foster care and adoption placement, it shall be the practice of the children's division, when appropriate, to support a child's return to the custody and care of the parents or guardians with whom the child resided immediately prior to state custody;\n\n(3) When restoration of care and custody is not appropriate or possible, the children's division shall attempt to place the child with suitable relatives in accordance with section 210.565;\n\n(4) The children's division shall further support familial stability by ensuring continuity of foster placement, except in instances where cause for a change in a child's placement is reasonably found;\n\n(5) The children's division shall work with each child in state custody to develop both a permanency plan and a case plan. These plans shall be developed within twelve months of a child's entrance into state custody. The permanency plan shall include the child's immediate and long-term placement goals, while the case plan shall address a child's specific medical and emotional needs;\n\n(6) Recognizing the value of familial relationships in foster care and adoption settings, it shall be the practice of the children's division to place siblings in the same foster care, kinship, guardianship, or adoptive placement, unless doing so would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings. If siblings are not placed together, it shall be the practice of the children's division to support regular visitation and communication between siblings in state custody, and between children in state custody and their parents and relatives, where not otherwise prohibited or against a child's best interests; and\n\n(7) The children's division shall support all children twelve years of age or older in state custody to attend any hearings pertaining to the child's placement, custody, or care, provided that the child is willing and able to attend such hearings, and that attending such hearings is in the best interests of the child.\n\n(L. 2017 S.B. 160)",

Relatives of child shall be given foster home placement, when — definitions — order of preference — specific findings required, when — sibling placement — age of relative not a factor, when — federal requirements to be followed for placement of Native American children — waiver of certain standards, when — GAL or counsel to ascertain child's wishes, when. —1. Whenever a child is placed in a foster home and the court has determined pursuant to subsection 4 of this section that foster home placement with relatives is not contrary to the best interest of the child, the children's division shall give foster home placement to relatives of the child. Notwithstanding any rule of the division to the contrary and under section 210.305, the children's division shall complete a diligent search to locate and notify the grandparents, adult siblings, parents of siblings of the child, and all other relatives and determine whether they wish to be considered for placement of the child. Grandparents who request consideration shall be given preference and first consideration for foster home placement of the child. If more than one grandparent requests consideration, the family support team shall make recommendations to the juvenile or family court about which grandparent should be considered for placement.\n\n2. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:\n\n(1)\"Adult sibling\", any brother or sister of whole or half-blood who is at least eighteen years of age;\n\n(2)\"Relative\", a grandparent or any other person related to another by blood or affinity or a person who is not so related to the child but has a close relationship with the child or the child's family. A foster parent or kinship caregiver with whom a child has resided for nine months or more is a person who has a close relationship with the child. The status of a grandparent shall not be affected by the death or the dissolution of the marriage of a son or daughter;\n\n(3)\"Sibling\", one of two or more individuals who have one or both parents in common through blood, marriage, or adoption, including siblings as defined by the child's tribal code or custom.\n\n3. The following shall be the order or preference for placement of a child under this section:\n\n(1) Grandparents;\n\n(2) Adult siblings or parents of siblings;\n\n(3) Relatives; and\n\n(4) Any foster parent who is currently licensed and capable of accepting placement of the child.\n\n4. The preference for placement and first consideration for grandparents or preference for placement with other relatives created by this section shall only apply where the court finds that placement with such grandparents or other relatives is not contrary to the best interest of the child considering all circumstances. If the court finds that it is contrary to the best interest of a child to be placed with grandparents or other relatives, the court shall make specific findings on the record detailing the reasons why the best interests of the child necessitate placement of the child with persons other than grandparents or other relatives. Absent evidence to the contrary, the court may presume that continuation of the child's placement with his or her current caregivers is in the child's best interests.\n\n5. Recognizing the critical nature of sibling bonds for children, the children's division shall make reasonable efforts to place siblings in the same foster care, kinship, guardianship, or adoptive placement, unless doing so would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings. If siblings are not placed together, the children's division shall make reasonable efforts to provide frequent visitation or other ongoing interaction between the siblings, unless this interaction would be contrary to a sibling's safety or well-being.\n\n6. The age of the child's grandparent or other relative shall not be the only factor that the children's division takes into consideration when it makes placement decisions and recommendations to the court about placing the child with such grandparent or other relative.\n\n7. For any Native American child placed in protective custody, the children's division shall comply with the placement requirements set forth in 25 U.S.C. Section 1915.\n\n8. A grandparent or other relative may, on a case-by-case basis, have standards for licensure not related to safety waived for specific children in care that would otherwise impede licensing of the grandparent's or relative's home. In addition, any person receiving a preference may be licensed in an expedited manner if a child is placed under such person's care.\n\n9. The guardian ad litem or child's counsel shall ascertain the child's wishes and feelings about his or her placement by conducting an interview or interviews with the child, if appropriate based on the child's age and maturity level, which shall be considered as a factor in placement decisions and recommendations, but shall not supersede the preference for relative placement created by this section or be contrary to the child's best interests.\n\n(L. 1990 H.B. 1370, et al., A.L. 1994 H.B. 1547 & 961, A.L. 2004 H.B. 1453 merged with S.B. 762, A.L. 2009 H.B. 154, A.L. 2011 H.B. 431 merged with H.B. 604, A.L. 2017 S.B. 160, A.L. 2019 H.B. 397, A.L. 2022 S.B. 683, A.L. 2023 S.B. 186, A.L. 2025 H.B. 737 & 486 merged with S.B. 43)",

(1) The children's division and its contractors, recognizing that foster parents are not clients but rather are colleagues in the child welfare team, shall treat foster parents in a manner consistent with the National Association of Social Workers' ethical standards of conduct as described in its Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities to Colleagues. Foster parents shall treat the children in their care, the child's birth family and members of the child welfare team in a manner consistent with their ethical responsibilities as professional team members.\n\n(2) The children's division and its contractors shall provide written notification of the rights enumerated in this section at the time a child is placed with the prospective foster parent, at initial licensure, and at the time of each licensure renewal following the initial licensure period.\n\n2. (1) The children's division and its contractors shall provide foster parents with regularly scheduled opportunities for preservice training, and regularly scheduled opportunities for pertinent inservice training, as determined by the Missouri State Foster Care and Adoption Advisory Board.\n\n(2) The children's division and its contractors shall provide to foster parents and potential adoptive parents, prior to placement, all pertinent information, including but not limited to full disclosure of all medical, psychological, and psychiatric conditions of the child, as well as information from previous placements that would indicate that the child or children may have a propensity to cause violence to any member of the foster family home. The foster parents shall be provided with any information regarding the child or the child's family, including but not limited to the case plan, any family history of mental or physical illness, sexual abuse of the child or sexual abuse perpetrated by the child, criminal background of the child or the child's family, fire-setting or other destructive behavior by the child, substance abuse by the child or child's family, or any other information which is pertinent to the care and needs of the child and to protect the foster or adoptive family. The children's division and its contractors shall provide full access to the child's medical, psychological, and psychiatric records in its possession at the time of placement, including records prior to the child coming into care, at the time the child is placed with a foster parent. After initial placement, the children's division and its contractors shall have a continuing duty and obligation to provide access to such records that come into its possession or of which the division or its contractors become aware. Access shall include providing information and authorization for foster parents to review or to obtain the records directly from the medical, psychological, or psychiatric services provider. A foster parent may decline access to any or all of the child's records. Knowingly providing false or misleading information to foster parents in order to secure placement shall be denoted in the caseworker's personnel file and shall be kept on record by the division.\n\n(3) The children's division and its contractors shall arrange preplacement visits, except in emergencies.\n\n(4) The foster parents may ask questions about the child's case plan, encourage a placement or refuse a placement without reprisal from the caseworker or agency. After a placement, the children's division and its contractors shall update the foster parents as new information about the child is gathered.\n\n(5) Foster parents shall be informed in a timely manner by the children's division and its contractors of all team meetings and staffings concerning their licensure status or children placed in their homes, and shall be allowed to participate, consistent with section 210.761.\n\n(6) The children's division and its contractors shall establish reasonably accessible respite care for children in foster care for short periods of time, jointly determined by foster parents and the child's caseworker pursuant to section 210.545. Foster parents shall follow all procedures established by the children's division and its contractors for requesting and using respite care.\n\n(7) Foster parents shall treat all information received from the children's division and its contractors about the child and the child's family as confidential. Information necessary for the medical or psychiatric care of the child may be provided to the appropriate practitioners. Foster parents may share information necessary with school personnel in order to secure a safe and appropriate education for the child. Additionally, foster parents shall share information they may learn about the child and the child's family, and concerns that arise in the care of the child, with the caseworker and other members of the child welfare team. Recognizing that placement changes are difficult for children, foster parents shall seek all necessary information, and participate in preplacement visits whenever possible, before deciding whether to accept a child for placement.\n\n3. (1) Foster parents shall make decisions about the daily living concerns of the child, and shall be permitted to continue the practice of their own family values and routines while respecting the child's cultural heritage. All discipline shall be consistent with state laws and regulations. The children's division shall allow foster parents to help plan visitation between the child and the child's siblings or biological family. Visitations should be scheduled at a time that meets the needs of the child, the biological family members, and the foster family whenever possible. Recognizing that visitation with family members is an important right of children in foster care, foster parents shall be flexible and cooperative with regard to family visits. The children's division shall not require foster parents to conduct supervised visits or be present during any supervised visits between the child and the child's siblings or biological family.\n\n(2) Foster parents shall provide care that is respectful of the child's cultural identity and needs. Recognizing that cultural competence can be learned, the children's division and their contractors shall provide foster parents with training that specifically addresses cultural needs of children, including but not limited to, information on skin and hair care, information on any specific religious or cultural practices of the child's biological family, and referrals to community resources for ongoing education and support.\n\n(3) Foster parents shall recognize that the purpose of discipline is to teach and direct the behavior of the child, and ensure that it is administered in a humane and sensitive manner. Foster parents shall use discipline methods which are consistent with children's division policy.\n\n4. (1) Consistent with state laws and regulations, the children's division and its contractors shall provide, upon request by the foster parents, information about a child's progress after the child leaves foster care.\n\n(2) Except in emergencies, foster parents shall be given two weeks advance notice and a written statement of the reasons before a child is removed from their care. When requesting removal of a child from their home, foster parents shall give two weeks advance notice, consistent with division policy, to the child's caseworker, except in emergency situations.\n\n(3) Recognizing the critical nature of attachment for children, if a child reenters the foster care system and is not placed in a relative home, the child's former foster parents shall be given first consideration for placement of the child.\n\n(4) If a child becomes free for adoption while in foster care, the child's foster family shall be given preferential consideration as adoptive parents consistent with section 453.070.\n\n(5) If a foster child becomes free for adoption and the foster parents desire to adopt the child, they shall inform the caseworker within sixty days of the caseworker's initial query. If they do not choose to pursue adoption, foster parents shall make every effort to support and encourage the child's placement in a permanent home, including but not limited to providing information on the history and care needs of the child and accommodating transitional visitation.\n\n5. Foster parents shall be informed by the court no later than two weeks prior to all court hearings pertaining to a child in their care, and informed of their right to attend and participate, consistent with section 211.464.\n\n6. The children's division and their contractors shall provide access to a fair and impartial grievance process to address licensure, case management decisions, and delivery of service issues. Foster parents shall have timely access to the child placement agency's appeals process, and shall be free from acts of retaliation when exercising the right to appeal.\n\n7.

The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (H) insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.

The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.\n\nB. The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in consultation with the State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision created hereunder. The commissioner shall be the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee from that state who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.\n\nC.

Such noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex-officio (nonvoting) members.

The commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of a simple majority of the compacting states, shall call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and meetings shall be open to the public.\n\nF. The Interstate Commission shall establish an executive committee, which shall include commission officers, members, and others as determined by the bylaws.

The executive committee shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact managed by an executive director and Interstate Commission staff; administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and performs such other duties as directed by the Interstate Commission or set forth in the bylaws.\n\nG. Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A member shall vote in person and shall not delegate a vote to another compacting state. However, a commissioner, in consultation with the state council, shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting state at a specified meeting.

Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact.

For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate Commission's legal counsel shall publicly certify that, in the legal counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.\n\nK.

Officers and Staff\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for any ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission, but shall not be a member and shall hire and supervise such other staff as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection C. Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification\n\n1. The commission's executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that any such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.\n\n2. The liability of any commissioner, or the employee or agent of a commissioner, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the Constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director or the employees or representatives of the Interstate Commission and, subject to the approval of the attorney general of the state represented by any commissioner of a compacting state, shall defend such commissioner or the commissioner's representatives or employees in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, or the commissioner's representatives or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.\n\nRULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nA. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.\n\nB. Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the \"Model State Administrative Procedures Act,\" 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the U.S. Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.\n\nC. When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall, at a minimum:\n\n1. publish the proposed rule's entire text stating the reason(s) for that proposed rule;\n\n2. allow and invite any and all persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record, and be made publicly available;\n\n3. provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by ten (10) or more persons; and\n\n4. promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials, or interested parties.\n\nD. Allow, not later than sixty days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nE. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n\nF. The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superseded by this act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.\n\nG. Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that a state-of-emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the emergency rule.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nOVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nSection A. Oversight\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall oversee the administration and operations of the interstate movement of juveniles subject to this compact in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in noncompacting states which may significantly affect compacting states.\n\n2. The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions, and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, it shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.\n\nSection B. Dispute Resolution\n\n1. The compacting states shall report to the Interstate Commission on all issues and activities necessary for the administration of the compact as well as issues and activities pertaining to compliance with the provisions of the compact and its bylaws and rules.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a compacting state, to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the compact and which may arise among compacting states and between compacting and noncompacting states. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XI of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nA. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nB. The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\nD. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nTHE STATE COUNCIL\n\nEach member state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims groups, and the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state, including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\nA. Any state, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands as defined in Article II of this compact is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\nB. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than 35 of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\nSection A. Withdrawal\n\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n\n2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.\n\n4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection B. Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default\n\n1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\na. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nb. Alternative Dispute Resolution;\n\nc. Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and\n\nd. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\n2. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.\n\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial Enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of Compact\n\n1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\n2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nA. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\nB. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other Laws\n\n1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\n2. All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding Effect of the Compact\n\n1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\n2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\n4. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\n(L. 1955 p. 675 § 1, A.L. 2007 S.B. 84)\n\nEffective 8-26-08, see § 210.580",

Such a petition may be filed at any time prior to December 31, 2011. After that date, the petition shall be filed within two years of the entry of the original judgment of paternity and support or within two years of entry of the later judgment in the case of separate judgments of paternity and support and shall be filed in the county which entered the judgment or judgments of paternity and support. Any such petition shall be served upon the biological mother and any other legal guardian or custodian in the same manner provided for service of process in the rules of civil procedure. The child or children shall be made a party and shall have a guardian ad litem appointed for the child or children before any further proceedings are had. If the child or children are recipients of IV-D services as defined in subdivision (8) of section 454.460, the family support division shall also be made a party and shall be duly served.\n\n2.

The affidavit shall also allege that the test results, which are attached thereto, indicate that a person subject to the child support payment order has been excluded as the child's father; or\n\n(2) A request to the court for an order of genetic paternity testing using DNA methodology.\n\n3. The court, after a hearing wherein all interested parties have been given an opportunity to present evidence and be heard, and upon a finding of probable cause to believe said testing may result in a determination of nonpaternity, shall order the relevant parties to submit to genetic paternity testing. The genetic paternity testing costs shall be paid by the petitioner.\n\n4. Upon a finding that the genetic test referred to herein was properly conducted, accurate, and indicates that the person subject to the child support payment order has been excluded as the child's father, the court shall, unless it makes written findings of fact and conclusions of law that it is in the best interest of the parties not to do so:\n\n(1) Grant relief on the petition and enter judgment setting aside the previous judgment or judgments of paternity and support, or acknowledgment of paternity under section 210.823 only as to the child or children found not to be the biological child or children of the petitioner;\n\n(2) Extinguish any existing child support arrearage only as to the child or children found not to be the biological child or children of the petitioner; and\n\n(3) Order the department of health and senior services to modify the child's birth certificate accordingly.\n\n5. The provisions of this section shall not apply to grant relief to the parent of any adopted child.\n\n6. A finding under subsection 4 of this section shall constitute a material mistake of fact under section 210.823.\n\n7. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to create a cause of action to recover child support or state debt, under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 454.465 and subsection 10 of section 452.340, that was previously paid pursuant to the order. The petitioner shall have no right for reimbursement for any moneys previously paid pursuant to said order.\n\n8.

If the court determines, after hearing, that the petitioner has had a judgment or judgments of paternity and support set aside under this section, the court shall enter an order of expungement. Upon granting of the order of expungement under this subsection, the records and files maintained in any administrative or court proceeding in an associate or circuit division of the circuit court under this section shall be confidential and only available to the parties or by order of the court for good cause shown. The effect of such order shall be to restore such person to the status he or she occupied prior to such arrest, plea, or conviction and as if such event had never taken place. No person as to whom such order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial, conviction, or expungement in response to any inquiry made of him for any purpose whatsoever and no such inquiry shall be made for information relating to an expungement under this section.\n\n9.

In addition, any person who obtains information on the relinquishing parent shall not disclose such information except to the following:\n\n(1) A birth parent who has waived anonymity or the child's adoptive parent;\n\n(2) The staff of the department of health and senior services, the department of social services, or any county health or social services agency or licensed child welfare agency that provides services to the child;\n\n(3) A person performing juvenile court intake or dispositional services;\n\n(4) The attending physician;\n\n(5) The child's foster parent or any other person who has physical custody of the child;\n\n(6) A juvenile court or other court of competent jurisdiction conducting proceedings relating to the child;\n\n(7) The attorney representing the interests of the public in proceedings relating to the child; and\n\n(8) The attorney representing the interests of the child.\n\n5.

If delivery of a newborn is made pursuant to this section in any place other than a hospital, the person taking physical custody of the child shall arrange for the immediate transportation of the child to the nearest hospital licensed pursuant to chapter 197.\n\n6. The hospital, its employees, agents and medical staff shall perform treatment in accordance with the prevailing standard of care as necessary to protect the physical health or safety of the child. The hospital shall notify the children's division and the local juvenile officer upon receipt of a child pursuant to this section. The local juvenile officer shall immediately begin protective custody proceedings and request the child be made a ward of the court during the child's stay in the medical facility. Upon discharge of the child from the medical facility and pursuant to a protective custody order ordering custody of the child to the division, the children's division shall take physical custody of the child. The parent's voluntary delivery of the child in accordance with this section shall constitute the parent's implied consent to any such act and a voluntary relinquishment of such parent's parental rights.\n\n7. In any termination of parental rights proceeding initiated after the relinquishment of a child pursuant to this section, the juvenile officer shall make public notice that a child has been relinquished, including the sex of the child, and the date and location of such relinquishment. Within thirty days of such public notice, the parent wishing to establish parental rights shall identify himself or herself to the court and state his or her intentions regarding the child. The court shall initiate proceedings to establish paternity, or if no person identifies himself as the father within thirty days, maternity. The juvenile officer shall make examination of the putative father registry established in section 192.016 to determine whether attempts have previously been made to preserve parental rights to the child. If such attempts have been made, the juvenile officer shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice of the abandonment of the child to such putative father.\n\n8. (1) If a relinquishing parent of a child relinquishes custody of the child to a newborn safety incubator or to any person listed in subsection 3 of this section in accordance with this section and to preserve the parental rights of the nonrelinquishing parent, the nonrelinquishing parent shall take such steps necessary to establish parentage within thirty days after the public notice or specific notice provided in subsection 7 of this section.\n\n(2) If either parent fails to take steps to establish parentage within the thirty-day period specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection, either parent may have all of his or her rights terminated with respect to the child.\n\n(3) When either parent inquires at a hospital regarding a child whose custody was relinquished pursuant to this section, such facility shall refer such parent to the children's division and the juvenile court exercising jurisdiction over the child.\n\n9. The persons listed in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section shall be immune from civil, criminal, and administrative liability for accepting physical custody of a child pursuant to this section if such persons accept custody in good faith. Such immunity shall not extend to any acts or omissions, including negligent or intentional acts or omissions, occurring after the acceptance of such child.\n\n10. The children's division shall:\n\n(1) Provide information and answer questions about the process established by this section on the statewide, toll-free telephone number maintained pursuant to section 210.145;\n\n(2) Provide information to the public by way of pamphlets, brochures, or by other ways to deliver information about the process established by this section.\n\n11. It shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution for a violation of sections 568.030, 568.032, 568.045, and 568.050 that a parent who is a defendant voluntarily relinquished a child no more than one year old under this section.\n\n12. Nothing in this section shall be construed as conflicting with section 210.125.\n\n13. (1) There is hereby created in the state treasury the \"Safe Place for Newborns Fund\", which shall consist of moneys appropriated by the general assembly from general revenue and any gifts, bequests, or donations. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund and, upon appropriation, moneys in this fund shall be used solely for the installation of newborn safety incubators.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the general revenue fund.\n\n(3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the fund.\n\n14. The state of Missouri shall provide matching moneys from the general revenue fund for the installation of newborn safety incubators. The total amount available to the fund from state sources under such a match program shall be up to ten thousand dollars for each newborn safety incubator installed.\n\n15. The director of the department of health and senior services may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the administration of this section, including rules governing the specifications, installation, maintenance, and oversight of newborn safety incubators. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028.

Section 1111;\n\n(b) Felony child abuse or neglect;\n\n(c) A felony crime against children, including child pornography;\n\n(d) Felony spousal abuse;\n\n(e) A felony crime involving rape or sexual assault;\n\n(f) Felony kidnapping;\n\n(g) Felony arson;\n\n(h) Felony physical assault or battery;\n\n(i) A violent misdemeanor offense committed as an adult against a child, including the offense of child abuse, child endangerment, or sexual assault, or a misdemeanor offense involving child pornography; or\n\n(j) Any similar offense in any federal, state, municipal, or other court.\n\n(2) If a finding of ineligibility is based on an offense not provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the prospective child care staff member or child care staff member may appeal to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in his or her criminal background check or to offer information mitigating the results and explaining why an eligibility exception should be granted.\n\n(3) The written appeal shall be filed with the department within ten days from the mailing of the notice of ineligibility. The department shall attempt to verify the accuracy of the information challenged by the individual, including making an effort to locate any missing disposition information related to the disqualifying offense. After the department verifies the accuracy of the information challenged by the individual, the department shall make a final decision on the written appeal, and such decision shall be made in a timely manner. Such decision shall be considered a noncontested final agency decision by the department, appealable under section 536.150.

The department may adopt emergency rules to implement the requirements of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2018, shall be invalid and void.\n\n12.
