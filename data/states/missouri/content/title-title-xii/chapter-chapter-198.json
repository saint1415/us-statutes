Whenever a duly authorized representative of the department finds upon an inspection of a facility that it is not in compliance with the provisions of sections 198.003 to 198.096 and the standards established thereunder, the operator or administrator shall be informed of the deficiencies in an exit interview conducted with the operator or administrator, or his or her designee. The department shall inform the operator or administrator, in writing, of any violation of a class I standard at the time the determination is made. A written report shall be prepared of any deficiency for which there has not been prompt remedial action, and a copy of such report and a written correction order shall be sent to the operator or administrator by a delivery service that provides a dated receipt of delivery within ten working days after the inspection, stating separately each deficiency and the specific statute or regulation violated.\n\n2. The operator or administrator shall have five working days following receipt of a written report and correction order regarding a violation of a class I standard and ten working days following receipt of the report and correction order regarding violations of class II or class III standards to request any conference and to submit a plan of correction for the department's approval which contains specific dates for achieving compliance. Within five working days after receiving a plan of correction regarding a violation of a class I standard and within ten working days after receiving a plan of correction regarding a violation of a class II or III standard, the department shall give its written approval or rejection of the plan. If there was a violation of any class I standard, immediate corrective action shall be taken by the operator or administrator and a written plan of correction shall be submitted to the department. The department shall give its written approval or rejection of the plan and if the plan is acceptable, a reinspection shall be conducted within twenty calendar days of the exit interview to determine if deficiencies have been corrected. If there was a violation of any class II standard and the plan of correction is acceptable, an unannounced reinspection shall be conducted between forty and ninety calendar days from the date of the exit conference to determine the status of all previously cited deficiencies. If there was a violation of class III standards sufficient to establish that the facility was not in substantial compliance, an unannounced reinspection shall be conducted within one hundred twenty days of the exit interview to determine the status of previously identified deficiencies.\n\n3. If, following the reinspection, the facility is found not in substantial compliance with sections 198.003 to 198.096 and the standards established thereunder or the operator is not correcting the noncompliance in accordance with the approved plan of correction, the department shall issue a notice of noncompliance, which shall be sent by a delivery service that provides a dated receipt of delivery to the operator or administrator of the facility, according to the most recent information or documents on file with the department.\n\n4. The notice of noncompliance shall inform the operator or administrator that the department may seek the imposition of any of the sanctions and remedies provided for in section 198.067, or any other action authorized by law.\n\n5. At any time after an inspection is conducted, the operator may choose to enter into a consent agreement with the department to obtain a probationary license. The consent agreement shall include a provision that the operator will voluntarily surrender the license if substantial compliance is not reached in accordance with the terms and deadlines established under the agreement. The agreement shall specify the stages, actions and time span to achieve substantial compliance.\n\n6. Whenever a notice of noncompliance has been issued, the operator shall post a copy of the notice of noncompliance and a copy of the most recent inspection report in a conspicuous location in the facility, and the department shall send a copy of the notice of noncompliance to the department of social services, the department of mental health, and any other concerned federal, state or local governmental agencies.\n\n(L. 1979 S.B. 328, et al. § 9, A.L. 1984 S.B. 451, A.L. 1988 S.B. 602, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1335 & 1381, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision, A.L. 2022 H.B. 2331 merged with S.B. 710)",

The circuit court shall determine the amount of penalty to be assessed within the limits set out in this section. Appeals may be taken from the judgment of the circuit court as in other civil cases.\n\n3.

Violations shall be presumed to continue to exist from the time they are found until the time the department of health and senior services finds them to have been corrected. When applicable, the amount of the penalty shall be determined as follows:\n\n(1) For each violation of a class I standard when applicable pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection, not less than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars;\n\n(2) For each violation of a class II standard, not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars;\n\n(3) For each violation of a class III standard, not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars;\n\n(4) For each violation of a federal standard which does not also constitute a violation of a state law or regulation, not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars;\n\n(5) For each specific class I violation by the same operator at a particular facility which has been previously cited within the past twenty-four months and for each specific class II or III violation by the same operator at a particular facility which has been previously cited within the past twelve months, double the amount last imposed;\n\n(6) In accordance with the provisions of this section, if the department imposes a civil monetary penalty for a class I violation, the liability for such penalty shall be incurred immediately upon the imposition of the penalty for the violation regardless of any subsequent correction of the violation by the facility. For class II or III violations, if the department imposes a civil monetary penalty, the liability for such penalty shall be incurred if a breach of a specific state or federal standard or statute remains uncorrected and not in accord with the accepted plan of correction at the time of the reinspection conducted pursuant to subsection 3 of section 198.026 or the regulations established pursuant to Title 42 of the United States Code.­­A judgment rendered against the operator of a facility pursuant to this subsection shall bear interest as provided in subsection 1 of section 408.040.\n\n­­A judgment rendered against the operator of a facility pursuant to this subsection shall bear interest as provided in subsection 1 of section 408.040.\n\n4.

The remaining fifty percent of the penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the nursing facility quality of care fund to be used by the department for the sole purpose of developing a program to assist qualified nursing facilities to improve the quality of service to their residents. The director of the department shall, by rule, develop a definition of qualified facilities and shall establish procedures for the selection of qualified facilities. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any*of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2003, shall be invalid and void.

Any person required in subsection 1 of this section to report or cause a report to be made to the department who knowingly fails to make a report within a reasonable time after the act of abuse or neglect as required in this subsection is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n4. In addition to the penalties imposed by this section, any administrator who knowingly conceals any act of abuse or neglect resulting in death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 556.061, is guilty of a class E felony.\n\n5. In addition to those persons required to report pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, any other person having reasonable cause to believe that a resident has been abused or neglected may report such information to the department.\n\n6. Upon receipt of a report, the department shall initiate an investigation within twenty-four hours and, as soon as possible during the course of the investigation, shall notify the resident's next of kin or responsible party of the report and the investigation and further notify them whether the report was substantiated or unsubstantiated unless such person is the alleged perpetrator of the abuse or neglect. As provided in section 192.2425, substantiated reports of elder abuse shall be promptly reported by the department to the appropriate law enforcement agency and prosecutor.\n\n7. If the investigation indicates possible abuse or neglect of a resident, the investigator shall refer the complaint together with the investigator's report to the department director or the director's designee for appropriate action.

All skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities not required prior to August 28, 2007, to install and maintain an approved sprinkler system shall install and maintain an approved sprinkler system in accordance with NFPA 13 by December 31, 2012, unless the facility receives an exemption from the department and presents evidence in writing from a certified sprinkler system representative or licensed engineer that the facility is unable to install an approved National Fire Protection Association 13 system due to the unavailability of water supply requirements associated with this system.\n\n6. Facilities that take a substantial step, as specified in subsections 4 and 5 of this section, to install an approved NFPA 13R or 13 system prior to December 31, 2012, may apply to the state treasurer's office for a loan in accordance with section 198.075 to install such system. However, such loan shall not be available if by December 31, 2009, the average total reimbursement for the care of persons eligible for Medicaid public assistance in an assisted living facility and residential care facility is equal to or exceeds fifty-two dollars per day. The average total reimbursement includes room, board, and care delivered by the facility, but shall not include payments to the facility for care or services not provided by the facility.

Such loans received under this subsection and in accordance with section 198.075, shall be paid in full as follows:\n\n(1) Ten years for those facilities approved for the loan and whose average total reimbursement rate for the care of persons eligible for Medicaid public assistance is equal to forty-eight and no more than forty-nine dollars per day;\n\n(2) Eight years for those facilities approved for the loan and whose average total reimbursement rate for the care of persons eligible for Medicaid public assistance is greater than forty-nine and no more than fifty-two dollars per day; or\n\n(3) Five years for those facilities approved for the loan and whose average total reimbursement rate for the care of persons eligible for Medicaid public assistance is greater than fifty-two dollars per day.\n\n(4) No payments or interest shall be due until the average total reimbursement rate for the care of persons eligible for Medicaid public assistance is equal to or greater than forty-eight dollars.\n\n7. (1) All facilities licensed under this chapter shall be equipped with a complete fire alarm system in compliance with NFPA 101, Life Safety Code for Detection, Alarm, and Communication Systems, or shall maintain a system that was approved by the department when such facility was constructed so long as such system is a complete fire alarm system. A complete fire alarm system shall include, but not be limited to, interconnected smoke detectors, automatic transmission to the fire department, dispatching agency, or central monitoring company, manual pull stations at each required exit and attendant's station, heat detectors, and audible and visual alarm indicators. If a facility submits a plan of compliance for installation of a sprinkler system required by this chapter, such facility shall install a complete fire alarm system that complies with NFPA 72 upon installation of the sprinkler system. Until such time that the sprinkler system is installed in the facility which has submitted a plan of compliance, each resident room or any room designated for sleeping in the facility shall be equipped with at least one battery-powered smoke alarm installed, tested, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 72. In addition, any such facility shall be equipped with heat detectors interconnected to the fire alarm system which are installed, tested, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 72 in all areas subject to nuisance alarms, including but not limited to kitchens, laundries, bathrooms, mechanical air handling rooms, and attic spaces.\n\n(2) In addition, each floor accessed by residents shall be divided into at least two smoke sections by one-hour rated smoke partitions.

Facilities with a complete fire alarm system and smoke sections meeting the requirements of this subsection prior to August 28, 2007, shall continue to meet such requirements. Facilities initially licensed on or after August 28, 2007, shall comply with such requirements beginning August 28, 2007, or on the effective date of licensure.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the requirements for complete fire alarm systems and smoke sections shall be enforceable on December 31, 2008.\n\n8. The requirements of this section shall be construed to supersede the provisions of section 198.058 relating to the exemption of facilities from construction standards.\n\n9. Fire safety inspections of skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities licensed under this chapter for compliance with this section shall be conducted annually by the department. All department inspectors who inspect facilities for compliance under this section shall complete a fire inspector course, as developed by the division of fire safety within the department of public safety, by December 31, 2012. Fire safety inspections of residential care and assisted living facilities licensed under this chapter for compliance with this section shall be conducted annually by the state fire marshal. The provisions of this section shall be enforced by the department or the state fire marshal, depending on which entity conducted the inspection.\n\n10.

The total amount paid to the decedent or expended upon such decedent's behalf by the department shall be a debt due the state and recovered from the available funds upon the department's claim on such funds. The department shall make a claim on the funds within sixty days from the date of the accounting of the funds by the facility.

If the outgoing operator refuses to sign the closeout report, such operator shall state in writing the specific reasons for his or her failure to so sign, and the successor operator shall complete the report and attach an affidavit stating that the information contained therein is true to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. Such report shall be retained with all other records and accounts required to be maintained under this section;\n\n(10) Not be required to invest any funds received from or on behalf of a resident, nor to increase the principal of any such funds.\n\n2. Any owner, operator, manager, employee, or affiliate of an owner or operator who receives any personal property or anything else of value from a resident, shall, if the thing received has a value of ten dollars or more, make a written statement giving the date it was received, from whom it was received, and its estimated value. Statements required to be made pursuant to this subsection shall be retained by the operator and shall be made available for inspection by the department, or by the department of mental health when the resident has been placed by that department, and by the resident, and such resident's designee or legal guardian. Any person who fails to make a statement required by this subsection is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\n\n3. No owner, operator, manager, employee, or affiliate of an owner or operator shall in one calendar year receive any personal property or anything else of value from the residents of any facility which have a total estimated value in excess of one hundred dollars.\n\n4. Subsections 2 and 3 of this section shall not apply if the property or other thing of value is held in trust in accordance with subsection 1 of this section, is received in payment for services rendered or pursuant to the terms of a lawful contract, or is received from a resident who is related to the recipient within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity.\n\n5.

For each report the division shall attempt to obtain the name and address of the facility, the name of the facility employee, the name of the resident, information regarding the nature of the misappropriation, the name of the complainant, and any other information which might be helpful in an investigation.\n\n9. Upon receipt of a report, the department shall initiate an investigation.\n\n10. If the investigation indicates probable misappropriation of property or funds of a resident, the investigator shall refer the complaint together with his or her report to the department director or the director's designee for appropriate action.\n\n11. Reports shall be confidential, as provided under section 192.2500.\n\n12. Anyone, except any person participating in or benefitting from the misappropriation of funds, who makes a report pursuant to this section or who testifies in any administrative or judicial proceeding arising from the report shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability for making such a report or for testifying except for liability for perjury, unless such person acted negligently, recklessly, in bad faith, or with malicious purpose.\n\n13. Within five working days after a report required to be made under this section is received, the person making the report shall be notified in writing of its receipt and of the initiation of the investigation.\n\n14. No person who directs or exercises any authority in a facility shall evict, harass, dismiss or retaliate against a resident or employee because he or she or any member of his or her family has made a report of any violation or suspected violation of laws, ordinances or regulations applying to the facility which he or she has reasonable cause to believe has been committed or has occurred.\n\n15. The department shall maintain the employee disqualification list and place on the employee disqualification list the names of any persons who have been finally determined by the department, pursuant to section 192.2490, to have misappropriated any property or funds of a resident while employed in any facility.\n\n(L. 1979 S.B. 328, et al. § 30, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1086, A.L. 1989 S.B. 203 & 270, A.L. 1992 S.B. 573 & 634, A.L. 1993 H.B. 564, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)",

A receiver may not be required to honor any lease, mortgage, secured transaction or other wholly or partially executory contract entered into by the facility's operator or administrator while acting in that capacity, if the agreement is unconscionable. Factors which shall be considered in determining the unconscionability include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The person seeking payment under the agreement was an affiliate of the operator or owner at the time the agreement was made;\n\n(2) The rental, price, or rate of interest required to be paid under the agreement was substantially in excess of a reasonable rental, price or rate of interest at the time the agreement was entered into.\n\n2. If the receiver is in possession of real estate or goods subject to a lease, mortgage or security interest which the receiver is permitted to avoid under subsection 1 of this section, and if the real estate or goods are necessary for the continued operation of the facility, the receiver may apply to the court to set a reasonable rental, price or rate of interest to be paid by the receiver during the duration of the receivership. The court shall hold a hearing on the application within fifteen days. The receiver shall send notice of the application to any known owners of the property involved at least ten working days prior to the hearing. Payment by the receiver of the amount determined by the court to be reasonable is a defense to any action against the receiver for payment or for possession of the goods or real estate subject to the lease or mortgage involved by any person who received such notice, but the payment does not relieve the owner or operator of the facility of any liability for the difference between the amount paid by the receiver and the amount due under the original lease or mortgage involved.\n\n(L. 1979 S.B. 328, et al. § 38)\n\nEffective 7-1-79",
