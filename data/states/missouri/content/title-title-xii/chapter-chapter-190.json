The department shall, within a reasonable time after receipt of an application, cause such investigation as the department deems necessary to be made of the applicant for a ground ambulance license.\n\n2. Any person that owned and operated a licensed ambulance on December 31, 1997, shall receive an ambulance service license from the department, unless suspended, revoked or terminated, for that ambulance service area which was, on December 31, 1997, described and filed with the department as the primary service area for its licensed ambulances on August 28, 1998, provided that the person makes application and adheres to the rules and regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to sections 190.001 to 190.245.\n\n3. The department shall issue a new ground ambulance service license to an ambulance service that is not currently licensed by the department, or is currently licensed by the department and is seeking to expand its ambulance service area, except as provided in subsection 4 of this section, to be valid for a period of five years, unless suspended, revoked or terminated, when the director finds that the applicant meets the requirements of ambulance service licensure established pursuant to sections 190.100 to 190.245 and the rules adopted by the department pursuant to sections 190.001 to 190.245.

A contract between a political subdivision and a licensed ambulance service for the provision of ambulance services for that political subdivision shall expand, without further action by the department, the ambulance service area of the licensed ambulance service to include the jurisdictional boundaries of the political subdivision. The termination of the aforementioned contract shall result in a reduction of the licensed ambulance service's ambulance service area by removing the geographic area of the political subdivision from its ambulance service area, except that licensed ambulance service providers may provide ambulance services as are needed at and around the state fair grounds for protection of attendees at the state fair.\n\n5. The department shall renew a ground ambulance service license if the applicant meets the requirements established pursuant to sections 190.001 to 190.245, and the rules adopted by the department pursuant to sections 190.001 to 190.245.\n\n6.

In addition to the provisions of section 190.165, the department of health and senior services may refuse to issue, deny renewal of, or suspend a license required pursuant to section 190.109, or take other corrective actions as described in this section, based on the following considerations:\n\n(1) The license holder is determined to be financially insolvent;\n\n(2) The ambulance service has inadequate personnel to operate the ambulance service to provide basic emergency operations. The ambulance service shall not be deemed to have such inadequate personnel as long as the ambulance service staffs to meet the needs of its emergency call volume.

If the department makes a determination of insolvency or insufficiency of operations of a license holder under subsection 1 of this section, then the department may require the license holder to submit a corrective plan within fifteen days and require implementation of the corrective plan within thirty days.\n\n3. The department shall be required to provide notice of any determination by the department of insolvency or insufficiency of operations of a license holder to other license holders operating in the license holder's vicinity, members of the general assembly who represent the license holder's service area, the governing officials of any county or municipal entity in the license holder's service area, the appropriate regional emergency medical services advisory committee, and the state advisory council on emergency medical services.\n\n4. The department shall immediately engage with other license holders in the area to determine the extent to which ground ambulance service may be provided to the affected service area during the time in which the license holder is unable to provide adequate services, including any long-term service arrangements. The nature of the agreement between the license holder and other license holders providing services to the affected area may include an agreement to provide services, a joint powers agreement, formal consideration, or some payment for services rendered.\n\n5. Any license holder who provides assistance in the service area of another license holder whose license has been suspended under this section shall have the right to seek reasonable compensation from the license holder whose license to operate has been suspended for all calls, stand-by time, and responses to medical emergencies during such time as the license remains suspended. The reasonable compensation shall not be limited to those expenses incurred in actual responses, but may also include reasonable expenses to maintain ambulance service, including, but not limited to, the daily operation costs of maintaining the service, personnel wages and benefits, equipment purchases and maintenance, and other costs incurred in the operation of a ground ambulance service.

The department of health and senior services in cooperation with hospitals and local and regional EMS systems and agencies may provide public and professional information and education programs related to emergency medical services systems including trauma, STEMI, and stroke systems and emergency medical care and treatment. The department of health and senior services may also provide public information and education programs for informing residents of and visitors to the state of the availability and proper use of emergency medical services, of the designation a hospital may receive as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center, of the value and nature of programs to involve citizens in the administering of prehospital emergency care, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and of the availability of training programs in emergency care for members of the general public.\n\n2. The department shall, for trauma care, STEMI care, and stroke care, respectively:\n\n(1) Compile, assess, and make publicly available peer-reviewed and evidence-based clinical research and guidelines that provide or support recommended treatment standards and that have been recommended by the time-critical diagnosis advisory committee;\n\n(2) Assess the capacity of the emergency medical services system and hospitals to deliver recommended treatments in a timely fashion;\n\n(3) Use the research, guidelines, and assessment to promulgate rules establishing protocols for transporting trauma patients to a trauma center, STEMI patients to a STEMI center, or stroke patients to a stroke center. Such transport protocols shall direct patients to trauma centers, STEMI centers, and stroke centers under section 190.243 based on the centers' capacities to deliver recommended acute care treatments within time limits suggested by clinical research;\n\n(4) Define regions within the state for purposes of coordinating the delivery of trauma care, STEMI care, and stroke care, respectively;\n\n(5) Promote the development of regional or community-based plans for transporting trauma, STEMI, or stroke patients via ground or air ambulance to trauma centers, STEMI centers, or stroke centers, respectively, in accordance with section 190.243; and\n\n(6) Establish procedures for the submission of community-based or regional plans for department approval.\n\n3.

Trauma, STEMI, or stroke centers, designation by department — site reviews — grounds for suspension or revocation of designation — data submission and analysis — fees — administrative hearing commission to hear persons aggrieved by designation. —1. Except as provided for in subsection 4 of this section, the department shall designate a hospital as an adult, pediatric or adult and pediatric trauma center when a hospital, upon proper application submitted by the hospital and site review, has been found by the department to meet the applicable level of trauma center criteria for designation in accordance with rules adopted by the department as prescribed by section 190.185. Site review may occur on-site or by any reasonable means of communication, or by any combination thereof. Such rules shall include designation as a trauma center without site review if such hospital is verified by a national verifying or designating body at the level which corresponds to a level approved in rule. In developing trauma center designation criteria, the department shall use, as it deems practicable, peer-reviewed and evidence-based clinical research and guidelines including, but not limited to, the most recent guidelines of the American College of Surgeons.\n\n2. Except as provided for in subsection 4 of this section, the department shall designate a hospital as a STEMI or stroke center when such hospital, upon proper application and site review, has been found by the department to meet the applicable level of STEMI or stroke center criteria for designation in accordance with rules adopted by the department as prescribed by section 190.185. Site review may occur on-site or by any reasonable means of communication, or by any combination thereof. In developing STEMI center and stroke center designation criteria, the department shall use, as it deems practicable, peer-reviewed and evidence-based clinical research and guidelines including, but not limited to, the most recent guidelines of the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, or the American Stroke Association. Such rules shall include designation as a STEMI center or stroke center without site review if such hospital is certified by a national body.\n\n3. The department of health and senior services shall, not less than once every three years, conduct a site review of every trauma, STEMI, and stroke center through appropriate department personnel or a qualified contractor, with the exception of trauma centers, STEMI centers, and stroke centers designated pursuant to subsection 4 of this section; however, this provision is not intended to limit the department's ability to conduct a complaint investigation pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 197.080 of any trauma, STEMI, or stroke center. Site reviews shall be coordinated for the different types of centers to the extent practicable with hospital licensure inspections conducted under chapter 197. No person shall be a qualified contractor for purposes of this subsection who has a substantial conflict of interest in the operation of any trauma, STEMI, or stroke center under review. The department may deny, place on probation, suspend or revoke such designation in any case in which it has determined there has been a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any rules or regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter. Centers that are placed on probationary status shall be required to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations promulgated under this chapter within twelve months of the date of the receipt of the notice of probationary status, unless otherwise provided by a settlement agreement with a duration of a maximum of eighteen months between the department and the designated center. If the department of health and senior services has determined that a hospital is not in compliance with such provisions or regulations, it may conduct additional announced or unannounced site reviews of the hospital to verify compliance. If a trauma, STEMI, or stroke center fails two consecutive site reviews because of substantial noncompliance with standards prescribed by sections 190.001 to 190.245 or rules adopted by the department pursuant to sections 190.001 to 190.245, its center designation shall be revoked.\n\n4. (1) Instead of applying for trauma, STEMI, or stroke center designation under subsection 1 or 2 of this section, a hospital may apply for trauma, STEMI, or stroke center designation under this subsection. Upon receipt of an application on a form prescribed by the department, the department shall designate such hospital at a state level that corresponds to a similar national designation as set forth in rules promulgated by the department. The rules shall be based on standards of nationally recognized organizations and the recommendations of the time-critical diagnosis advisory committee.\n\n(2) Except as provided by subsection 5 of this section, the department shall not require compliance with any additional standards for establishing or renewing trauma, STEMI, or stroke designations under this subsection. The designation shall continue if such hospital remains certified or verified. The department may remove a hospital's designation as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center if the hospital requests removal of the designation or the department determines that the certificate or verification that qualified the hospital for the designation under this subsection has been suspended or revoked. Any decision made by the department to withdraw its designation of a center pursuant to this subsection that is based on the revocation or suspension of a certification or verification by a certifying or verifying organization shall not be subject to judicial review. The department shall report to the certifying or verifying organization any complaint it receives related to the center designated pursuant to this subsection. The department shall also advise the complainant which organization certified or verified the center and provide the necessary contact information should the complainant wish to pursue a complaint with the certifying or verifying organization.\n\n5. Any hospital receiving designation as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center pursuant to subsection 4 of this section shall:\n\n(1) Within thirty days of any changes or receipt of a certificate or verification, submit to the department proof of certification or verification and the names and contact information of the center's medical director and the program manager; and\n\n(2) Participate in local and regional emergency medical services systems for purposes of providing training, sharing clinical educational resources, and collaborating on improving patient outcomes.\n\n­­Any hospital receiving designation as a level III stroke center pursuant to subsection 4 of this section shall have a formal agreement with a level I or level II stroke center for physician consultative services for evaluation of stroke patients for thrombolytic therapy and the care of the patient post-thrombolytic therapy.\n\n6. Hospitals designated as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center by the department shall submit data by one of the following methods:\n\n(1) Entering hospital data into a state registry; or\n\n(2) Entering hospital data into a national registry or data bank. A hospital submitting data pursuant to this subdivision shall not be required to collect and submit any additional trauma, STEMI, or stroke center data elements. No hospital submitting data to a national data registry or data bank under this subdivision shall withhold authorization for the department to access such data through such national data registry or data bank. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as requiring duplicative data entry by a hospital that is otherwise complying with the provisions of this subsection. Failure of the department to obtain access to data submitted to a national data registry or data bank shall not be construed as hospital noncompliance under this subsection.\n\n7. When collecting and analyzing data pursuant to the provisions of this section, the department shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n(1) Names of any health care professionals, as defined in section 376.1350, shall not be subject to disclosure;\n\n(2) The data shall not be disclosed in a manner that permits the identification of an individual patient or encounter;\n\n(3) The data shall be used for the evaluation and improvement of hospital and emergency medical services' trauma, stroke, and STEMI care; and\n\n(4) Trauma, STEMI, and stroke center data elements shall conform to national registry or data bank data elements, and include published detailed measure specifications, data coding instructions, and patient population inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure data reliability and validity.\n\n8. The department shall not have authority to establish additional education requirements for physicians who are emergency medicine board-certified or board-eligible through the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) or the American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) and who are practicing in the emergency department of a facility designated as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center by the department under this section. The department shall deem the education requirements promulgated by ABEM or AOBEM to meet the standards for designations under this section. Education requirements for non-ABEM or non-AOBEM certified physicians, nurses, and other providers who provide care at a facility designated as a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center by the department under this section shall mirror but not exceed those established by national designating or verifying bodies of trauma centers, STEMI centers, or stroke centers.\n\n9. The department of health and senior services may establish appropriate fees to offset only the costs of trauma, STEMI, and stroke center surveys.\n\n10. No hospital shall hold itself out to the public as a STEMI center, stroke center, adult trauma center, pediatric trauma center, or an adult and pediatric trauma center unless it is designated as such by the department of health and senior services.\n\n11. Any person aggrieved by an action of the department of health and senior services affecting the trauma, STEMI, or stroke center designation pursuant to this chapter, including the revocation, the suspension, or the granting of, refusal to grant, or failure to renew a designation, may seek a determination thereon by the administrative hearing commission under chapter 621. It shall not be a condition to such determination that the person aggrieved seek a reconsideration, a rehearing, or exhaust any other procedure within the department.\n\n(L. 1987 S.B. 31 & 29 § 4, A.L. 1998 S.B. 743, A.L. 2008 H.B. 1790, A.L. 2016 S.B. 635 merged with S.B. 732 merged with S.B. 988, A.L. 2017 S.B. 50, A.L. 2022 H.B. 2331)",

In lieu of the tax levy authorized under section 190.305 for emergency telephone services, the county commission of any county may impose a county sales tax for the provision of central dispatching of fire protection, including law enforcement agencies, emergency ambulance service or any other emergency services, including emergency telephone services, which shall be collectively referred to herein as\"emergency services\", and which may also include the purchase and maintenance of communications and emergency equipment, including the operational costs associated therein, in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n2. Such county commission may, by a majority vote of its members, submit to the voters of the county, at a public election, a proposal to authorize the county commission to impose a tax under the provisions of this section. If the residents of the county present a petition signed by a number of residents equal to ten percent of those in the county who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election, then the commission shall submit such a proposal to the voters of the county.\n\n3.

Amounts collected in excess of that necessary within a given year shall be carried forward to subsequent years. The board shall make its determination of such tax rate each year no later than September first and shall fix the new rate which shall be collected as provided in sections 190.290 to 190.296.

This initial board shall serve until its successor board is duly elected and installed in office. The commission shall ensure geographic representation of the county by appointing no more than four members from each district of the county commission.\n\n10. Beginning in 1994, three members shall be elected from each district of the county commission and one member shall be elected at large.

In 1996, and thereafter, all terms of office shall be four years. The election of the board members shall be conducted at the first municipal election held in a calendar year.\n\n11. When the board is organized, it shall be a body corporate and a political subdivision of the state and shall be known as the \"______ Emergency Services Board\".\n\n12.

Emergency telephone service may be provided — tax levy authorized — governing body of Christian and Scott counties may contract for services — time limitation on tax — rate — collection. —1. In addition to its other powers for the protection of the public health, a governing body may provide for the operation of an emergency telephone service and may pay for it by levying an emergency telephone tax for such service in those portions of the governing body's jurisdiction for which emergency telephone service has been contracted. The governing body may do such other acts as are expedient for the protection and preservation of the public health and are necessary for the operation of the emergency telephone system. The governing body is hereby authorized to levy the tax in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent of the tariff local service rate, as defined in section 190.300, or seventy-five cents per access line per month, whichever is greater, except as provided in sections 190.325 to 190.329, in those portions of the governing body's jurisdiction for which emergency telephone service has been contracted. In any county of the third classification with a population of at least thirty-two thousand but not greater than forty thousand that borders a county of the first classification, a governing body of a third or fourth class city may, with the consent of the county commission, contract for service with a public agency to provide services within the public agency's jurisdiction when such city is located wholly within the jurisdiction of the public agency. Consent shall be demonstrated by the county commission authorizing an election within the public agency's jurisdiction pursuant to section 190.320. Any contract between governing bodies and public agencies in existence on August 28, 1996, that meets such criteria prior to August 28, 1996, shall be recognized if the county commission authorized the election for emergency telephone service and a vote was held as provided in section 190.320. The governing body shall provide for a board pursuant to sections 190.327 and 190.328. The board of any county of the first classification with more than one hundred four thousand six hundred but fewer than one hundred four thousand seven hundred inhabitants shall provide services to a city located in more than one county only after making an agreement or contracting with the city for such services, provided that any agreement or contract in effect, as of January 1, 2006, shall continue until such time as a successor agreement or contract is entered into by the board and city and such agreement or contract is to provide services for a period of three or more years.\n\n2. The tax shall be utilized to pay for the operation of emergency telephone service and the operational costs associated with the answering and dispatching of emergency calls as deemed appropriate by the governing body, and may be levied at any time subsequent to execution of a contract with the provider of such service at the discretion of the governing body, but collection of such tax shall not begin prior to twenty-seven months before operation of the emergency telephone service and dispatch center.\n\n3. Such tax shall be levied only upon the tariff rate. No tax shall be imposed upon more than one hundred exchange access facilities or their equivalent per person per location.\n\n4. Every billed service user is liable for the tax until it has been paid to the service supplier.\n\n5. The duty to collect the tax from a service user shall commence at such time as specified by the governing body in accordance with the provisions of sections 190.300 to 190.320. The tax required to be collected by the service supplier shall be added to and may be stated separately in the billings to the service user.\n\n6. Nothing in this section imposes any obligation upon a service supplier to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the tax imposed by this section.

The amount of the prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge shall be either separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the consumer by the seller or otherwise disclosed to the consumer.\n\n(4) For purposes of this subsection, a retail transaction that is effected in person by a consumer at a business location of the seller shall be treated as occurring in this state if that business location is in this state, and any other retail transaction shall be treated as occurring in this state if the retail transaction is treated as occurring under chapter 144.\n\n(5) The prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge is the liability of the consumer and not of the seller or of any provider; except that, the seller shall be liable to remit all charges that the seller collects or is deemed to collect.\n\n(6) The amount of the prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge that is collected by a seller from a consumer, if such amount is separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document provided to the consumer by the seller, shall not be included in the base for measuring any tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge that is imposed by this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any intergovernmental agency.\n\n3. (1) Prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges collected by sellers shall be remitted to the department at the times and in the manner provided by state law with respect to sales and use taxes. The department shall establish registration and payment procedures that substantially coincide with the registration and payment procedures that apply under state law.

Beginning on February 1, 2019, a seller shall be permitted to deduct and retain three percent of prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges that are collected by the seller from consumers.\n\n(3) The department shall establish procedures by which a seller of prepaid wireless telecommunications service may document that a sale is not a retail transaction, which procedures shall substantially coincide with the procedures for documenting sale for resale transactions for sales and use purposes under state law.\n\n(4) The department shall deposit all remitted prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges into the general revenue fund for the department's use until eight hundred thousand one hundred fifty dollars is collected to reimburse its direct costs of administering the collection and remittance of prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges. From then onward, the department shall deposit all remitted prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges into the Missouri 911 service trust fund created under section 190.420 within thirty days of receipt for use by the board. After the initial eight hundred thousand one hundred fifty dollars is collected, the department may deduct an amount not to exceed one percent of collected charges to be retained by the department to reimburse its direct costs of administering the collection and remittance of prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges.\n\n(5) The board shall set a rate between twenty-five and one hundred percent of the prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges deposited in the Missouri 911 service trust fund collected in counties without a charter form of government, less the deductions authorized in subdivision (4) of this subsection, that shall be remitted to such counties in direct proportion to the amount of charges collected in each county. The board shall set a rate between sixty-five and one hundred percent of the prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges deposited in the Missouri 911 service trust fund collected in counties with a charter form of government and any city not within a county, less the deductions authorized in subdivision (4) of this subsection, that shall be remitted to each such county or city not within a county in direct proportion to the amount of charges collected in each such county or city not within a county. If a county has an elected emergency services board, the Missouri 911 service board shall remit the funds to the elected emergency services board, except for an emergency services board originally organized under section 190.325 operating within a county with a charter form of government and with more than two hundred thousand but fewer than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants, in which case the funds shall be remitted to the county's general fund for the purpose of public safety infrastructure. The initial percentage rate set by the board for counties with and without a charter form of government and any city not within a county shall be set by June thirtieth of each applicable year and may be adjusted annually for the first three years, and thereafter the rate may be adjusted every three years; however, at no point shall the board set rates that fall below twenty-five percent for counties without a charter form of government and sixty-five percent for counties with a charter form of government and any city not within a county.\n\n(6) Any amounts received by a county or city under subdivision (5) of this subsection shall be used only for purposes authorized in sections 190.305, 190.325, and 190.335. Any amounts received by any county with a charter form of government and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer than seven hundred thousand inhabitants under this section may be used for emergency service notification systems.\n\n4. (1) A seller that is not a provider shall be entitled to the immunity and liability protections under section 190.455, notwithstanding any requirement in state law regarding compliance with Federal Communications Commission Order 05-116.\n\n(2) A provider shall be entitled to the immunity and liability protections under section 190.455.\n\n(3) In addition to the protection from liability provided in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, each provider and seller and its officers, employees, assigns, agents, vendors, or anyone acting on behalf of such persons shall be entitled to the further protection from liability, if any, that is provided to providers and sellers of wireless telecommunications service that is not prepaid wireless telecommunications service under section 190.455.\n\n5. The prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge imposed by this section shall be in addition to any other tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge imposed by this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any intergovernmental agency for 911 funding purposes.\n\n6. The provisions of this section shall become effective unless the governing body of a county or city adopts an ordinance, order, rule, resolution, or regulation by at least a two-thirds vote prohibiting the charge established under this section from becoming effective in the county or city at least forty-five days prior to the effective date of this section*. If the governing body does adopt such ordinance, order, rule, resolution, or regulation by at least a two-thirds vote, the charge shall not be collected and the county or city shall not be allowed to obtain funds from the Missouri 911 service trust fund that are remitted to the fund under the charge established under this section. The Missouri 911 service board shall, by September 1, 2018, notify all counties and cities of the implementation of the charge established under this section, and the procedures set forth under this subsection for prohibiting the charge from becoming effective.\n\n7. Any county or city which prohibited the prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6 of this section may take a vote of the governing body, and notify the department of revenue of the result of such vote to impose such charge. A vote of at least two-thirds of the governing body is required in order to impose such charge.

In order to provide the best possible 911 technology and service to all areas of the state in the most efficient and economical manner possible, it is the public policy of this state to encourage the consolidation of emergency communications operations.\n\n2. Any county, city, or 911 or emergency services board established under this chapter*or section 321.243 may contract and cooperate with any other county, city, or 911 or emergency services board established under this chapter*or section 321.243 as provided in sections 70.210 to 70.320.

If two or more counties, cities, 911 districts, or existing emergency communications entities desire to consolidate their emergency communications operations, a joint emergency communications entity may be established by the parties through an agreement identifying the conditions and provisions of the consolidation and the operation of the joint entity. This agreement may include the establishment of a joint governing body that may be comprised of the boards of the entities forming the agreement currently authorized by statute or an elected or appointed joint board authorized under section 70.260; provided that, the representation on the joint board of each of the entities forming the agreement shall be equal.

A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\n(L. 2018 H.B. 1355 merged with S.B. 870)",

The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.\n\n4. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n\n(1) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n\n(2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n5. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\n6. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.\n\n7. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n8. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\n9. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.

Upon a request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.\n\n11. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.\n\n12. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n\n13. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n14. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.
