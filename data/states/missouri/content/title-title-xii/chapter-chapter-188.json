      "text": "Title XII PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nChapter 188\n\n188.026. Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act — findings of general assembly — interests of the state of Missouri. —1. This section and sections 188.056, 188.057, and 188.058 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act\".\n\n2. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), certain information about the development of the unborn child, human pregnancy, and the effects of abortion was either not part of the record or was not available at the time. Since 1973, advances in medical and scientific technology have greatly expanded our knowledge of prenatal life and the effects of abortion on women. The general assembly of this state finds:\n\n(1) At conception, a new genetically distinct human being is formed;\n\n(2) The fact that the life of an individual human being begins at conception has long been recognized in Missouri law: \"[T]he child is, in truth, alive from the moment of conception\". State v. Emerich, 13 Mo. App. 492, 495 (1883), affirmed, 87 Mo. 110 (1885). Under section 1.205, the general assembly has recognized that the life of each human being begins at conception and that unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being;\n\n(3) The first prohibition of abortion in Missouri was enacted in 1825. Since then, the repeal and reenactment of prohibitions of abortion have made distinctions with respect to penalties for performing or inducing abortion on the basis of \"quickening\"; however, the unborn child was still protected from conception onward;\n\n(4) In ruling that Missouri's prohibition on abortion was constitutional in 1972, the Missouri supreme court accepted as a stipulation of the parties that \"'[i]nfant Doe, Intervenor Defendant in this case, and all other unborn children have all the qualities and attributes of adult human persons differing only in age or maturity. Medically, human life is a continuum from conception to death.'\" Rodgers v. Danforth, 486 S.W.2d 258, 259 (1972);\n\n(5) In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), the Supreme Court, while considering the \"preamble\" that set forth \"findings\" in section 1.205, stated: \"We think the extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the courts of Missouri can definitively decide. State law has offered protections to unborn children in tort and probate law\". Id. at 506. Since Webster, Missouri courts have construed section 1.205 and have consistently found that an unborn child is a person for purposes of Missouri's homicide and assault laws when the unborn child's mother was killed or assaulted by another person. Section 1.205 has even been found applicable to the manslaughter of an unborn child who was eight weeks gestational age or earlier. State v. Harrison, 390 S.W.3d 927 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013);\n\n(6) In medicine, a special emphasis is placed on the heartbeat. The heartbeat is a discernible sign of life at every stage of human existence. During the fifth week of gestational age, an unborn child's heart begins to beat and blood flow begins during the sixth week;\n\n(7) Depending on the ultrasound equipment being used, the unborn child's heartbeat can be visually detected as early as six to eight weeks gestational age. By about twelve weeks gestational age, the unborn child's heartbeat can consistently be made audible through the use of a handheld Doppler fetal heart rate device;\n\n(8) Confirmation of a pregnancy can be indicated through the detection of the unborn child's heartbeat, while the absence of a heartbeat can be an indicator of the death of the unborn child if the child has reached the point of development when a heartbeat should be detectable;\n\n(9) Heart rate monitoring during pregnancy and labor is utilized to measure the heart rate and rhythm of the unborn child, at an average rate between one hundred ten and one hundred sixty beats per minute, and helps determine the health of the unborn child;\n\n(10) The Supreme Court in Roe discussed \"the difficult question of when life begins\" and wrote: \"[p]hysicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded [quickening] with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes 'viable', that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid\". Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. Today, however, physicians' and scientists' interests on life in the womb also focus on other markers of development in the unborn child, including, but not limited to, presence of a heartbeat, brain development, a viable pregnancy or viable intrauterine pregnancy during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the ability to experience pain;\n\n(11) In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), the Supreme Court noted that \"we recognized in Roe that viability was a matter of medical judgment, skill, and technical ability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term\". Id. at 64. Due to advances in medical technology and diagnoses, present-day physicians and scientists now describe the viability of an unborn child in an additional manner, by determining whether there is a viable pregnancy or viable intrauterine pregnancy during the first trimester of pregnancy;\n\n(12) While the overall risk of miscarriage after clinical recognition of pregnancy is twelve to fifteen percent, the incidence decreases significantly if cardiac activity in the unborn child has been confirmed. The detection of a heartbeat in an unborn child is a reliable indicator of a viable pregnancy and that the unborn child will likely survive to birth, especially if presenting for a prenatal visit at eight weeks gestational age or later. For asymptomatic women attending a first prenatal visit between six and eleven weeks gestational age where a heartbeat was confirmed through an ultrasound, the subsequent risk of miscarriage is one and six-tenths percent. Although the risk is higher at six weeks gestational age at nine and four-tenths percent, it declines rapidly to one and five-tenths percent at eight weeks gestational age, and less than one percent at nine weeks gestational age or later;\n\n(13) The presence of a heartbeat in an unborn child represents a more definable point of ascertaining survivability than the ambiguous concept of viability that has been adopted by the Supreme Court, especially since if a heartbeat is detected at eight weeks gestational age or later in a normal pregnancy, there is likely to be a viable pregnancy and there is a high probability that the unborn child will survive to birth;\n\n(14) The placenta begins developing during the early first trimester of pregnancy and performs a respiratory function by making oxygen supply to and carbon dioxide removal from the unborn child possible later in the first trimester and throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy;\n\n(15) By the fifth week of gestation, the development of the brain of the unborn child is underway. Brain waves have been measured and recorded as early as the eighth week of gestational age in children who were removed during an ectopic pregnancy or hysterectomy. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of an unborn child's brain is used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and brain activity has been observed using MRI;\n\n(16) Missouri law identifies the presence of circulation, respiration, and brain function as indicia of life under section 194.005, as the presence of circulation, respiration, and brain function indicates that such person is not legally dead, but is legally alive;\n\n(17) Unborn children at eight weeks gestational age show spontaneous movements, such as a twitching of the trunk and developing limbs. It has been reported that unborn children at this stage show reflex responses to touch. The perioral area is the first part of the unborn child's body to respond to touch at about eight weeks gestational age and by fourteen weeks gestational age most of the unborn child's body is responsive to touch;\n\n(18) Peripheral cutaneous sensory receptors, the receptors that feel pain, develop early in the unborn child. They appear in the perioral cutaneous area at around seven to eight weeks gestational age, in the palmar regions at ten to ten and a half weeks gestational age, the abdominal wall at fifteen weeks gestational age, and over all of the unborn child's body at sixteen weeks gestational age;\n\n(19) Substance P, a peptide that functions as a neurotransmitter, especially in the transmission of pain, is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of the unborn child at eight to ten weeks gestational age. Enkephalins, peptides that play a role in neurotransmission and pain modulation, are present in the dorsal horn at twelve to fourteen weeks gestational age;\n\n(20) When intrauterine needling is performed on an unborn child at sixteen weeks gestational age or later, the reaction to this invasive stimulus is blood flow redistribution to the brain. Increased blood flow to the brain is the same type of stress response seen in a born child and an adult;\n\n(21) By sixteen weeks gestational age, pain transmission from a peripheral receptor to the cortex is possible in the unborn child;\n\n(22) Physicians provide anesthesia during in utero treatment of unborn children as early as sixteen weeks gestational age for certain procedures, including those to correct fetal urinary tract obstruction. Anesthesia is administered by ultrasound-guided injection into the arm or leg of the unborn child;\n\n(23) A leading textbook on prenatal development of the human brain states, \"It may be concluded that, although nociperception (the actual perception of pain) awaits the appearance of consciousness, nociception (the experience of pain) is present some time before birth. In the absence of disproof, it is merely prudent to assume that pain can be experienced even early in prenatal life (Dr. J. Wisser, Zürich): the fetus should be given the benefit of the doubt\". Ronan O'Rahilly & Fabiola Müller. The Embryonic Human Brain: An Atlas of Developmental Stages (3d ed. 2005);\n\n(24) By fourteen or fifteen weeks gestational age or later, the predominant abortion method in Missouri is dilation and evacuation (D&E). The D&E abortion method includes the dismemberment, disarticulation, and exsanguination of the unborn child, causing the unborn child's death;\n\n(25) The Supreme Court acknowledged in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 160 (2007), that \"the standard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D&E\" partial birth abortion method banned by Congress and upheld as facially constitutional by the Supreme Court, even though the federal ban was applicable both before and after viability and had no exception for the health of the mother;\n\n(26) Missouri's ban on the partial birth abortion method, section 565.300, is in effect because of Gonzales v. Carhart and the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Nixon v. Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, Inc., 550 U.S. 901 (2007), to vacate and remand to the appellate court the prior invalidation of section 565.300. Since section 565.300, like Congress' ban on partial birth abortion, is applicable both before and after viability, there is ample precedent for the general assembly to constitutionally prohibit the brutal D&E abortion method at fourteen weeks gestational age or later, even before the unborn child is viable, with a medical emergency exception;\n\n(27) In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), the Supreme Court determined that \"evolving standards of decency\" dictated that a Missouri statute allowing the death penalty for a conviction of murder in the first degree for a person under eighteen years of age when the crime was committed was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because it violated the prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments\";\n\n(28) In Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1123 (2019), the Supreme Court noted that \"'[d]isgusting' practices\" like disemboweling and quartering \"readily qualified as 'cruel and unusual', as a reader at the time of the Eighth Amendment's adoption would have understood those words\";\n\n(29) Evolving standards of decency dictate that Missouri should prohibit the brutal and painful D&E abortion method at fourteen weeks gestational age or later, with a medical emergency exception, because if a comparable method of killing was used on:\n\n(a) A person convicted of murder in the first degree, it would be cruel and unusual punishment; or\n\n(b) An animal, it would be unlawful under state law because it would not be a humane method, humane euthanasia, or humane killing of certain animals under chapters 273 and 578;\n\n(30) In Roper, the Supreme Court also found that \"[i]t is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty.... The opinion of the world community, while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions\". Roper, 543 U.S. at 578. In its opinion, the Supreme Court was instructed by \"international covenants prohibiting the juvenile death penalty\", such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171. Id. at 577;\n\n(31) The opinion of the world community, reflected in the laws of the United Nation's 193-member states and six other entities, is that in most countries, most abortions are prohibited after twelve weeks gestational age or later;\n\n(32) The opinion of the world community is also shared by most Americans, who believe that most abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy should be illegal, based on polling that has remained consistent since 1996;\n\n(33) Abortion procedures performed later in pregnancy have a higher medical risk for women. Compared to an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier, the relative risk increases exponentially at later gestational ages. The relative risk of death for a pregnant woman who had an abortion performed or induced upon her at:\n\n(a) Eleven to twelve weeks gestational age is between three and four times higher than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;\n\n(b) Thirteen to fifteen weeks gestational age is almost fifteen times higher than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;\n\n(c) Sixteen to twenty weeks gestational age is almost thirty times higher than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier; and\n\n(d) Twenty-one weeks gestational age or later is more than seventy-five times higher than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;\n\n(34) In addition to the short-term risks of an abortion, studies have found that the long-term physical and psychological consequences of abortion for women include, but are not limited to, an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight babies, and placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies, as well as serious behavioral health issues. These risks increase as abortions are performed or induced at later gestational ages. These consequences of an abortion have a detrimental effect not only on women, their children, and their families, but also on an already burdened health care system, taxpayers, and the workforce;\n\n(35) A large percentage of women who have an abortion performed or induced upon them in Missouri each year are at less than eight weeks gestational age, a large majority are at less than fourteen weeks gestational age, a larger majority are at less than eighteen weeks gestational age, and an even larger majority are at less than twenty weeks gestational age. A prohibition on performing or inducing an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or later, with a medical emergency exception, does not amount to a substantial obstacle to a large fraction of women for whom the prohibition is relevant, which is pregnant women in Missouri who are seeking an abortion while not experiencing a medical emergency. The burden that a prohibition on performing or inducing an abortion at eight, fourteen, eighteen, or twenty weeks gestational age or later, with a medical emergency exception, might impose on abortion access, is outweighed by the benefits conferred upon the following:\n\n(a) Women more advanced in pregnancy who are at greater risk of harm from abortion;\n\n(b) Unborn children at later stages of development;\n\n(c) The medical profession, by preserving its integrity and fulfilling its commitment to do no harm; and\n\n(d) Society, by fostering respect for human life, born and unborn, at all stages of development, and by lessening societal tolerance of violence against innocent human life;\n\n(36) In Webster, the Supreme Court noted, in upholding a Missouri statute, \"that there may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age\". Webster, 492 U.S. at 516. Thus, an unborn child thought to be eight weeks gestational age might in fact be twelve weeks gestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk to the woman and the unborn child is considerably more developed. An unborn child at fourteen weeks gestational age might be eighteen weeks gestational age and an unborn child at eighteen weeks gestational age might be twenty-two weeks gestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk to the woman, the unborn child is considerably more developed, the abortion method likely to be employed is more brutal, and the risk of pain experienced by the unborn child is greater. An unborn child at twenty weeks gestational age might be twenty-four weeks gestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk to the woman, the unborn child is considerably more developed, the abortion method likely to be employed is more brutal, the risk of pain experienced by the unborn child is greater, and the unborn child may be viable.\n\n3. The state of Missouri is bound by Article VI, Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States that \"all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land\". One such treaty is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, entered into force on March 23, 1976, and adopted by the United States on September 8, 1992. In ratifying the Covenant, the United States declared that while the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing, the United States' understanding is that state governments share responsibility with the federal government in implementing the Covenant.\n\n4. Article 6, Paragraph 1, U.N.T.S. at 174, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states, \"Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life\". The state of Missouri takes seriously its obligation to comply with the Covenant and to implement this paragraph as it relates to the inherent right to life of unborn human beings, protecting the rights of unborn human beings by law, and ensuring that such unborn human beings are not arbitrarily deprived of life. The state of Missouri hereby implements Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant by the regulation of abortion in this state.\n\n5. The state of Missouri has interests that include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Protecting unborn children throughout pregnancy and preserving and promoting their lives from conception to birth;\n\n(2) Encouraging childbirth over abortion;\n\n(3) Ensuring respect for all human life from conception to natural death;\n\n(4) Safeguarding an unborn child from the serious harm of pain by an abortion method that would cause the unborn child to experience pain while she or he is being killed;\n\n(5) Preserving the integrity of the medical profession and regulating and restricting practices that might cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become insensitive, even disdainful, to life. This includes regulating and restricting abortion methods that are not only brutal and painful, but if allowed to continue, will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only unborn children, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life;\n\n(6) Ending the incongruities in state law by permitting some unborn children to be killed by abortion, while requiring that unborn children be protected in nonabortion circumstances through, including, but not limited to, homicide, assault, self-defense, and defense of another statutes; laws guaranteeing prenatal health care, emergency care, and testing; state-sponsored health insurance for unborn children; the prohibition of restraints in correctional institutions to protect pregnant offenders and their unborn children; and protecting the interests of unborn children by the appointment of conservators, guardians, and representatives;\n\n(7) Reducing the risks of harm to pregnant women who obtain abortions later in pregnancy; and\n\n(8) Avoiding burdens on the health care system, taxpayers, and the workforce because of increased preterm births, low birthweight babies, compromised pregnancies, extended postpartum recoveries, and behavioral health problems caused by the long-term effects of abortions performed or induced later in the pregnancy.\n\n(L. 2019 H.B. 126)",

No person or entity shall require, obtain, or accept payment for an abortion from or on behalf of a patient until at least seventy-two hours have passed since the time that the information required by subsection 1 of this section has been provided to the patient. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a person or entity from notifying the patient that payment for the abortion will be required after the seventy-two-hour period has expired if she voluntarily chooses to have the abortion.\n\n9. The term\"qualified professional\"as used in this section shall refer to a physician, physician assistant, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, psychologist, licensed professional counselor, or licensed social worker, licensed or registered under chapter 334, 335, or 337, acting under the supervision of the physician performing or inducing the abortion, and acting within the course and scope of his or her authority provided by law. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to in any way expand the authority otherwise provided by law relating to the licensure, registration, or scope of practice of any such qualified professional.\n\n10. By November 30, 2010, the department shall produce the written materials and forms described in this section. Any written materials produced shall be printed in a typeface large enough to be clearly legible. All information shall be presented in an objective, unbiased manner designed to convey only accurate scientific and medical information. The department shall furnish the written materials and forms at no cost and in sufficient quantity to any person who performs or induces abortions, or to any hospital or facility that provides abortions. The department shall make all information required by subsection 1 of this section available to the public through its department website. The department shall maintain a toll-free, twenty-four-hour hotline telephone number where a caller can obtain information on a regional basis concerning the agencies and services described in subsection 1 of this section. No identifying information regarding persons who use the website shall be collected or maintained. The department shall monitor the website on a regular basis to prevent tampering and correct any operational deficiencies.\n\n11. In order to preserve the compelling interest of the state to ensure that the choice to consent to an abortion is voluntary and informed, and given freely and without coercion, the department shall use the procedures for adoption of emergency rules under section 536.025 in order to promulgate all necessary rules, forms, and other necessary material to implement this section by November 30, 2010.\n\n12. If the provisions in subsections 1 and 8 of this section requiring a seventy-two-hour waiting period for an abortion are ever temporarily or permanently restrained or enjoined by judicial order, then the waiting period for an abortion shall be twenty-four hours; provided, however, that if such temporary or permanent restraining order or injunction is stayed or dissolved, or otherwise ceases to have effect, the waiting period for an abortion shall be seventy-two hours.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 523, et al., A.L. 2010 S.B. 793, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1307 & 1313, A.L. 2017 2d Ex.

For purposes of this subdivision,\"custodial parent\"shall only mean a parent of a minor who has been awarded joint legal custody or joint physical custody of such minor by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice shall not be required for any parent:\n\n(a) Who has been found guilty of any offense in violation of chapter 565, relating to offenses against the person; chapter 566, relating to sexual offenses; chapter 567, relating to prostitution; chapter 568, relating to offenses against the family; or chapter 573, related to pornography and related offenses, if a child was a victim;\n\n(b) Who has been found guilty of any offense in any other state or foreign country, or under federal, tribal, or military jurisdiction if a child was a victim, which would be a violation of chapters 565, 566, 567, 568, or 573 if committed in this state;\n\n(c) Who is listed on the sexual offender registry under sections 589.400 to 589.425;\n\n(d) Against whom an order of protection has been issued, including a foreign order of protection given full faith and credit in this state under section 455.067;\n\n(e) Whose custodial, parental, or guardianship rights have been terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction; or\n\n(f) Whose whereabouts are unknown after reasonable inquiry, who is a fugitive from justice, who is habitually in an intoxicated or drugged condition, or who has been declared mentally incompetent or incapacitated by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(2) The minor is emancipated and the attending physician has received the informed written consent of the minor;\n\n(3) The minor has been granted the right to self-consent to the abortion by court order pursuant to subsection 2 of this section, and the attending physician has received the informed written consent of the minor; or\n\n(4) The minor has been granted consent to the abortion by court order, and the court has given its informed written consent in accordance with subsection 2 of this section, and the minor is having the abortion willingly, in compliance with subsection 3 of this section.\n\n2. The right of a minor to self-consent to an abortion under subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section or court consent under subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section may be granted by a court pursuant to the following procedures:\n\n(1) The minor or next friend shall make an application to the juvenile court which shall assist the minor or next friend in preparing the petition and notices required pursuant to this section. The minor or the next friend of the minor shall thereafter file a petition setting forth the initials of the minor; the age of the minor; the names and addresses of each parent, guardian, or, if the minor's parents are deceased and no guardian has been appointed, any other person standing in loco parentis of the minor; that the minor has been fully informed of the risks and consequences of the abortion; that the minor is of sound mind and has sufficient intellectual capacity to consent to the abortion; that, if the court does not grant the minor majority rights for the purpose of consent to the abortion, the court should find that the abortion is in the best interest of the minor and give judicial consent to the abortion; that the court should appoint a guardian ad litem of the child; and if the minor does not have private counsel, that the court should appoint counsel. The petition shall be signed by the minor or the next friend;\n\n(2) A hearing on the merits of the petition, to be held on the record, shall be held as soon as possible within five days of the filing of the petition. If any party is unable to afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel at least twenty-four hours before the time of the hearing. At the hearing, the court shall hear evidence relating to the emotional development, maturity, intellect and understanding of the minor; the nature, possible consequences, and alternatives to the abortion; and any other evidence that the court may find useful in determining whether the minor should be granted majority rights for the purpose of consenting to the abortion or whether the abortion is in the best interests of the minor;\n\n(3) In the decree, the court shall for good cause:\n\n(a) Grant the petition for majority rights for the purpose of consenting to the abortion;\n\n(b) Find the abortion to be in the best interests of the minor and give judicial consent to the abortion, setting forth the grounds for so finding; or\n\n(c) Deny the petition, setting forth the grounds on which the petition is denied;\n\n(4) If the petition is allowed, the informed consent of the minor, pursuant to a court grant of majority rights, or the judicial consent, shall bar an action by the parents or guardian of the minor on the grounds of battery of the minor by those performing or inducing the abortion. The immunity granted shall only extend to the performance or induction of the abortion in accordance herewith and any necessary accompanying services which are performed in a competent manner. The costs of the action shall be borne by the parties;\n\n(5) An appeal from an order issued under the provisions of this section may be taken to the court of appeals of this state by the minor or by a parent or guardian of the minor. The notice of intent to appeal shall be given within twenty-four hours from the date of issuance of the order. The record on appeal shall be completed and the appeal shall be perfected within five days from the filing of notice to appeal. Because time may be of the essence regarding the performance or induction of the abortion, the supreme court of this state shall, by court rule, provide for expedited appellate review of cases appealed under this section.\n\n3. If a minor desires an abortion, then she shall be orally informed of and, if possible, sign the written consent required under this chapter in the same manner as an adult person. No abortion shall be performed or induced on any minor against her will, except that an abortion may be performed or induced against the will of a minor pursuant to a court order described in subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section that the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the minor.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 523, et al., A.L. 1986 H.B. 1596, A.L. 2019 H.B. 126)\n\nEffective 5-24-19\n\n(1981) Provisions of statute requiring notice to parents of all minors seeking abortions is unconstitutional because it requires notice to the parents of minors who are mature or minors for whom it is not in their best interest to give notice.

Except in the case of a medical emergency:\n\n(1) Prior to performing or inducing an abortion upon a woman, the physician shall determine the gestational age of the unborn child in a manner consistent with accepted obstetrical and neonatal practices and standards. In making such determination, the physician shall make such inquiries of the pregnant woman and perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations, imaging studies, and tests as a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the medical facts and conditions of both the woman and the unborn child involved, would consider necessary to perform and consider in making an accurate diagnosis with respect to gestational age;\n\n(2) If the physician determines that the gestational age of the unborn child is twenty weeks or more, prior to performing or inducing an abortion upon the woman, the physician shall determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by a skillful, careful, and prudent physician. In making this determination of viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and determination of viability in the medical record of the woman;\n\n(3) If the physician determines that the gestational age of the unborn child is twenty weeks or more, and further determines that the unborn child is not viable and performs or induces an abortion upon the woman, the physician shall report such findings and determinations and the reasons for such determinations to the health care facility in which the abortion is performed and to the state board of registration for the healing arts, and shall enter such findings and determinations in the medical records of the woman and in the individual abortion report submitted to the department under section 188.052;\n\n(4) (a) If the physician determines that the unborn child is viable, the physician shall not perform or induce an abortion upon the woman unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or that a continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman.\n\n(b) Before a physician may proceed with performing or inducing an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined that the unborn child is viable, the physician shall first certify in writing the medical threat posed to the life of the pregnant woman, or the medical reasons that continuation of the pregnancy would cause a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. Upon completion of the abortion, the physician shall report the reasons and determinations for the abortion of a viable unborn child to the health care facility in which the abortion is performed and to the state board of registration for the healing arts, and shall enter such findings and determinations in the medical record of the woman and in the individual abortion report submitted to the department under section 188.052.\n\n(c) Before a physician may proceed with performing or inducing an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined that the unborn child is viable, the physician who is to perform the abortion shall obtain the agreement of a second physician with knowledge of accepted obstetrical and neonatal practices and standards who shall concur that the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman, or that continuation of the pregnancy would cause a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. This second physician shall also report such reasons and determinations to the health care facility in which the abortion is to be performed and to the state board of registration for the healing arts, and shall enter such findings and determinations in the medical record of the woman and the individual abortion report submitted to the department under section 188.052. The second physician shall not have any legal or financial affiliation or relationship with the physician performing or inducing the abortion, except that such prohibition shall not apply to physicians whose legal or financial affiliation or relationship is a result of being employed by or having staff privileges at the same hospital as the term \"hospital\" is defined in section 197.020.\n\n(d) Any physician who performs or induces an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined that the unborn child is viable shall utilize the available method or technique of abortion most likely to preserve the life or health of the unborn child. In cases where the method or technique of abortion most likely to preserve the life or health of the unborn child would present a greater risk to the life or health of the woman than another legally permitted and available method or technique, the physician may utilize such other method or technique. In all cases where the physician performs an abortion upon a viable unborn child, the physician shall certify in writing the available method or techniques considered and the reasons for choosing the method or technique employed.\n\n(e) No physician shall perform or induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined that the unborn child is viable unless there is in attendance a physician other than the physician performing or inducing the abortion who shall take control of and provide immediate medical care for a child born as a result of the abortion. During the performance of the abortion, the physician performing it, and subsequent to the abortion, the physician required to be in attendance, shall take all reasonable steps in keeping with good medical practice, consistent with the procedure used, to preserve the life or health of the viable unborn child; provided that it does not pose an increased risk to the life of the woman or does not pose an increased risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman.\n\n3. Any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of the provisions of this section is guilty of a class D felony, and, upon a finding of guilt or plea of guilty, shall be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year, and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 558.002, shall be fined not less than ten thousand nor more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\n4. Any physician who pleads guilty to or is found guilty of performing or inducing an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this section shall be subject to suspension or revocation of his or her license to practice medicine in the state of Missouri by the state board of registration for the healing arts under the provisions of sections 334.100 and 334.103.\n\n5. Any hospital licensed in the state of Missouri that knowingly allows an abortion of an unborn child to be performed or induced in violation of this section may be subject to suspension or revocation of its license under the provisions of section 197.070.\n\n6. Any abortion facility licensed in the state of Missouri that knowingly allows an abortion of an unborn child to be performed or induced in violation of this section may be subject to suspension or revocation of its license under the provisions of section 197.220.\n\n7. A woman upon whom an abortion is performed or induced in violation of this section shall not be prosecuted for a conspiracy to violate the provisions of this section.\n\n8. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, nor is it the intention of this section to make lawful any abortion that is currently unlawful.\n\n9. It is the intent of the legislature that this section be severable as noted in section 1.140. In the event that any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, or clause of this section be declared invalid under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Missouri, it is the intent of the legislature that the remaining provisions of this section remain in force and effect as far as capable of being carried into execution as intended by the legislature.\n\n10.

The general assembly of this state finds that:\n\n(1) Removing vestiges of any past bias or discrimination against pregnant women, their partners, and their family members, including their unborn children, is an important task for those in the legal, medical, social services, and human services professions;\n\n(2) Ending any current bias or discrimination against pregnant women, their partners, and their family members, including their unborn children, is a legitimate purpose of government in order to guarantee that those who \"are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\" can enjoy \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\";\n\n(3) The historical relationship of bias or discrimination by some family planning programs and policies towards poor and minority populations, including, but not limited to, the nonconsensual sterilization of mentally ill, poor, minority, and immigrant women and other coercive family planning programs and policies, must be rejected;\n\n(4) Among Missouri residents, the rate of black or African-American women who undergo abortions is significantly higher, about three and one-half*times higher, than the rate of white women who undergo abortions. Among Missouri residents, the rate of black or African-American women who undergo repeat abortions is significantly higher, about one and one-half*times higher, than the rate of white women who undergo repeat abortions;\n\n(5) Performing or inducing an abortion because of the sex of the unborn child is repugnant to the values of equality of females and males and the same opportunities for girls and boys, and furthers a false mindset of female inferiority;\n\n(6) Government has a legitimate interest in preventing the abortion of unborn children with Down Syndrome because it is a form of bias or disability discrimination and victimizes the disabled unborn child at his or her most vulnerable stage. Eliminating unborn children with Down Syndrome raises grave concerns for the lives of those who do live with disabilities. It sends a message of dwindling support for their unique challenges, fosters a false sense that disability is something that could have been avoidable, and is likely to increase the stigma associated with disability.\n\n2.

For purposes of this section,\"medical emergency\"means a condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\n\n2. Except in the case of medical emergency, no person shall perform or induce an abortion unless at least seventy-two hours prior thereto the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion, a qualified professional, or the referring physician has conferred with the patient and discussed with her the indicators and contraindicators, and risk factors including any physical, psychological, or situational factors for the proposed procedure and the use of medications, including but not limited to mifepristone, in light of her medical history and medical condition. For an abortion performed or an abortion induced by a drug or drugs, such conference shall take place at least seventy-two hours prior to the writing or communication of the first prescription for such drug or drugs in connection with inducing an abortion. Only one such conference shall be required for each abortion.\n\n3.

At the end of the conference, and if the woman chooses to proceed with the abortion, the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion, a qualified professional, or the referring physician shall sign and shall cause the patient to sign a written statement that the woman gave her informed consent freely and without coercion after the physician or qualified professional had discussed with her the indicators and contraindicators, and risk factors, including any physical, psychological, or situational factors.

The provisions of this section shall not be construed to in any way expand the authority otherwise provided by law relating to the licensure, registration, or scope of practice of any such qualified professional.\n\n7. If the provisions in subsection 2 of this section requiring a seventy-two-hour waiting period for an abortion are ever temporarily or permanently restrained or enjoined by judicial order, then the waiting period for an abortion shall be twenty-four hours; provided, however, that if such temporary or permanent restraining order or injunction is stayed or dissolved, or otherwise ceases to have effect, the waiting period for an abortion shall be seventy-two hours.\n\n(L. 1979 H.B. 523, et al., A.L. 1986 H.B. 1596, A.L. 2003 H.B. 156, A.L. 2010 S.B. 793, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1307 & 1313, A.L. 2017 2d Ex.
