Health care providers, financial data, submission of data on infections to be collected, rules, recommendations — federal guidelines to be implemented — collection and use of data, restrictions, penalty — public reports required, when, requirements — rulemaking authority — antimicrobial stewardship program, report. —1. All health care providers shall at least annually provide to the department charge data as required by the department. All hospitals shall at least annually provide patient abstract data and financial data as required by the department. Hospitals as defined in section 197.020 shall report patient abstract data for outpatients and inpatients. Ambulatory surgical centers and abortion facilities as defined in section 197.200 shall provide patient abstract data to the department. The department shall specify by rule the types of information which shall be submitted and the method of submission.\n\n2. The department shall collect data on the incidence of health care-associated infections from hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, abortion facilities, and other facilities as necessary to generate the reports required by this section. Hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, abortion facilities, and other facilities shall provide such data in compliance with this section. In order to streamline government and to eliminate duplicative reporting requirements, if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or its successor entity, requires hospitals to submit health care-associated infection data, then hospitals and the department shall not be required to comply with the health care-associated infection data reporting requirements of subsections 2 to 17 of this section applicable to hospitals, except that the department shall post a link on its website to publicly reported data by hospitals on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare website, or its successor.\n\n3. The department shall promulgate rules specifying the standards and procedures for the collection, analysis, risk adjustment, and reporting of the incidence of health care-associated infections and the types of infections and procedures to be monitored pursuant to subsection 13 of this section. In promulgating such rules, the department shall:\n\n(1) Use methodologies and systems for data collection established by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor; and\n\n(2) Consider the findings and recommendations of the infection control advisory panel established pursuant to section 197.165.\n\n4. By January 1, 2017, the infection control advisory panel created by section 197.165 shall make recommendations to the department regarding the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' health care-associated infection data collection, analysis, and public reporting requirements for hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and other facilities in the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, in lieu of all or part of the data collection, analysis, and public reporting requirements of this section. The advisory panel recommendations shall address which hospitals shall be required as a condition of licensure to use the National Healthcare Safety Network for data collection; the use of the National Healthcare Safety Network for risk adjustment and analysis of hospital submitted data; and the use of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare website, or its successor, for public reporting of the incidence of health care-associated infection metrics. The advisory panel shall consider the following factors in developing its recommendation:\n\n(1) Whether the public is afforded the same or greater access to facility-specific infection control indicators and metrics;\n\n(2) Whether the data provided to the public is subject to the same or greater accuracy of risk adjustment;\n\n(3) Whether the public is provided with the same or greater specificity of reporting of infections by type of facility infections and procedures;\n\n(4) Whether the data is subject to the same or greater level of confidentiality of the identity of an individual patient;\n\n(5) Whether the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, has the capacity to receive, analyze, and report the required data for all facilities;\n\n(6) Whether the cost to implement the National Healthcare Safety Network infection data collection and reporting system is the same or less.\n\n5. After considering the recommendations of the infection control advisory panel, and provided that the requirements of subsection 13 of this section can be met, the department shall implement guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor. It shall be a condition of licensure for hospitals that meet the minimum public reporting requirements of the National Healthcare Safety Network and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to participate in the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor. Such hospitals shall permit the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, to disclose facility-specific infection data to the department as required under this section, and as necessary to provide the public reports required by the department. It shall be a condition of licensure for any ambulatory surgical center or abortion facility which does not voluntarily participate in the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, to submit facility-specific data to the department as required under this section, and as necessary to provide the public reports required by the department.\n\n6. The department shall not require the resubmission of data which has been submitted to the department of health and senior services or the department of social services under any other provision of law. The department of health and senior services shall accept data submitted by associations or related organizations on behalf of health care providers by entering into binding agreements negotiated with such associations or related organizations to obtain data required pursuant to section 192.665 and this section. A health care provider shall submit the required information to the department of health and senior services:\n\n(1) If the provider does not submit the required data through such associations or related organizations;\n\n(2) If no binding agreement has been reached within ninety days of August 28, 1992, between the department of health and senior services and such associations or related organizations; or\n\n(3) If a binding agreement has expired for more than ninety days.\n\n7. Information obtained by the department under the provisions of section 192.665 and this section shall not be public information. Reports and studies prepared by the department based upon such information shall be public information and may identify individual health care providers. The department of health and senior services may authorize the use of the data by other research organizations pursuant to the provisions of section 192.067. The department shall not use or release any information provided under section 192.665 and this section which would enable any person to determine any health care provider's negotiated discounts with specific preferred provider organizations or other managed care organizations. The department shall not release data in a form which could be used to identify a patient. Any violation of this subsection is a class A misdemeanor.\n\n8. The department shall undertake a reasonable number of studies and publish information, including at least an annual consumer guide, in collaboration with health care providers, business coalitions and consumers based upon the information obtained pursuant to the provisions of section 192.665 and this section. The department shall allow all health care providers and associations and related organizations who have submitted data which will be used in any publication to review and comment on the publication prior to its publication or release for general use. The publication shall be made available to the public for a reasonable charge.\n\n9. Any health care provider which continually and substantially, as these terms are defined by rule, fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall not be allowed to participate in any program administered by the state or to receive any moneys from the state.\n\n10. A hospital, as defined in section 197.020, aggrieved by the department's determination of ineligibility for state moneys pursuant to subsection 9 of this section may appeal as provided in section 197.071. An ambulatory surgical center or abortion facility as defined in section 197.200 aggrieved by the department's determination of ineligibility for state moneys pursuant to subsection 9 of this section may appeal as provided in section 197.221.\n\n11. The department of health may promulgate rules providing for collection of data and publication of the incidence of health care-associated infections for other types of health facilities determined to be sources of infections; except that, physicians' offices shall be exempt from reporting and disclosure of such infections.\n\n12. By January 1, 2017, the advisory panel shall recommend and the department shall adopt in regulation with an effective date of no later than January 1, 2018, the requirements for the reporting of the following types of infections as specified in this subsection:\n\n(1) Infections associated with a minimum of four surgical procedures for hospitals and a minimum of two surgical procedures for ambulatory surgical centers that meet the following criteria:\n\n(a) Are usually associated with an elective surgical procedure. An\"elective surgical procedure\"is a planned, nonemergency surgical procedure that may be either medically required such as a hip replacement or optional such as breast augmentation;\n\n(b) Demonstrate a high priority aspect such as affecting a large number of patients, having a substantial impact for a smaller population, or being associated with substantial cost, morbidity, or mortality; or\n\n(c) Are infections for which reports are collected by the National Healthcare Safety Network or its successor;\n\n(2) Central line-related bloodstream infections;\n\n(3) Health care-associated infections specified for reporting by hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and other health care facilities by the rules of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor; and\n\n(4) Other categories of infections that may be established by rule by the department.\n\n­­The department, in consultation with the advisory panel, shall be authorized to collect and report data on subsets of each type of infection described in this subsection.\n\n13. In consultation with the infection control advisory panel established pursuant to section 197.165, the department shall develop and disseminate to the public reports based on data compiled for a period of twelve months. Such reports shall be updated quarterly and shall show for each hospital, ambulatory surgical center, abortion facility, and other facility metrics on risk-adjusted health care-associated infections under this section.\n\n14. The types of infections under subsection 12 of this section to be publicly reported shall be determined by the department by rule and shall be consistent with the infections tracked by the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor.\n\n15. Reports published pursuant to subsection 13 of this section shall be published and readily accessible on the department's internet website. The reports shall be distributed at least annually to the governor and members of the general assembly. The department shall make such reports available to the public for a period of at least two years.\n\n16. The Hospital Industry Data Institute shall publish a report of Missouri hospitals', ambulatory surgical centers', and abortion facilities' compliance with standardized quality of care measures established by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for prevention of infections related to surgical procedures. If the Hospital Industry Data Institute fails to do so by July 31, 2008, and annually thereafter, the department shall be authorized to collect information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or from hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and abortion facilities and publish such information in accordance with this section.\n\n17. The data collected or published pursuant to this section shall be available to the department for purposes of licensing hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and abortion facilities pursuant to chapter 197.\n\n18. The department shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of section 192.131 and sections 197.150 to 197.160. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2004, shall be invalid and void.\n\n19. No later than August 28, 2017, each hospital, excluding mental health facilities as defined in section 632.005, and each ambulatory surgical center and abortion facility as defined in section 197.200, shall in consultation with its medical staff establish an antimicrobial stewardship program for evaluating the judicious use of antimicrobials, especially antibiotics that are the last line of defense against resistant infections. The hospital's stewardship program and the results of the program shall be monitored and evaluated by hospital quality improvement departments and shall be available upon inspection to the department. At a minimum, the antimicrobial stewardship program shall be designed to evaluate that hospitalized patients receive, in accordance with accepted medical standards of practice, the appropriate antimicrobial, at the appropriate dose, at the appropriate time, and for the appropriate duration.\n\n20. Hospitals described in subsection 19 of this section shall meet the National Healthcare Safety Network requirements for reporting antimicrobial usage or resistance by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR) Module when conditions of participation promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requiring the electronic reporting of antibiotic use or antibiotic resistance by hospitals become effective. When such antimicrobial usage or resistance reporting takes effect, hospitals shall authorize the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, to disclose to the department facility-specific information reported to the AUR Module. Facility-specific data on antibiotic usage and resistance collected under this subsection shall not be disclosed to the public, but the department may release case-specific information to other facilities, physicians, and the public if the department determines on a case-by-case basis that the release of such information is necessary to protect persons in a public health emergency. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a hospital from voluntarily reporting antibiotic use or antibiotic resistance data through the National Healthcare Safety Network, or its successor, prior to the effective date of the conditions of participation requiring the reporting.\n\n21. The department shall make a report to the general assembly beginning January 1, 2018, and on every January first thereafter on the incidence, type, and distribution of antimicrobial-resistant infections identified in the state and within regions of the state.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 1574 § 6 and S.B. 721 § 2 merged with S.B. 796 § 15, A.L. 1993 S.B. 52, A.L. 1995 S.B. 3, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1279, A.L. 2016 S.B. 579, A.L. 2017 2d Ex.

A temporary authorization granted under this subsection during the first eighteen months after August 28, 1992, shall be effective for no more than twelve months. A temporary authorization granted under this subsection after eighteen months after August 28, 1992, shall be effective for no more than six months. The department may withdraw a temporary authorization prior to its expiration if the radiation machine does not meet one or more of the standards set forth in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n4. To obtain authorization from the department of health and senior services to use a radiation machine for mammography, the person who owns or leases the radiation machine, or an authorized agent of the person, shall apply to the department for mammography authorization on an application form provided by the department and shall provide all of the information required by the department as specified on the application form. A person who owns or leases more than one radiation machine used for mammography shall obtain authorization for each radiation machine. The department shall process and respond to an application within thirty days after the date of receipt of the application. Upon determining to grant mammography authorization for a radiation machine, the department shall issue a certificate of registration specifying mammography authorization for each authorized radiation machine. A mammography authorization is effective for three years.\n\n5. The department shall annually inspect the radiation machine and may inspect the radiation machine more frequently. The department shall make reasonable efforts to coordinate the inspections under this section with the department's other inspections of the facility in which the radiation machine is located.\n\n6. After each satisfactory inspection by the department, the department shall issue a certificate of radiation machine inspection or a similar document identifying the facility and radiation machine inspected and providing a record of the date the radiation machine was inspected. The facility shall post the certificate issued by the American College of Radiology or the department of health and senior services near the inspected radiation machine.\n\n7. The department may withdraw the mammography authorization for a radiation machine if it does not meet one or more of the standards set forth in subsection 2 of this section.\n\n8. The department shall provide an opportunity for a hearing in connection with a denial or withdrawal of mammography authorization.\n\n9. Upon a finding that a deficiency in a radiation machine used for mammography or a violation of sections 192.760 to 192.766*or the rules promulgated under sections 192.760 to 192.766*seriously affects the health, safety, and welfare of individuals upon whom the radiation machine is used for mammography, the department may issue an emergency order summarily withdrawing the mammography authorization of the radiation machine. The department shall incorporate its findings in the order and shall provide an opportunity for a hearing within five working days after issuance of the order. The order shall be effective during the proceedings.\n\n10. If the department withdraws the mammography authorization of a radiation machine, the radiation machine shall not be used for mammography. An application for reinstatement of a mammography authorization shall be filed and processed in the same manner as an application for mammography authorization under subsection 4 of this section, except that the department shall not issue a reinstated certificate of mammography registration until the department receives the reinspection fee required under subsection 2 of section 192.764***, inspects the radiation machine, and determines that it meets the standards set forth in subsection 2 of this section. The department shall conduct an inspection required under this subsection no later than sixty days after receiving a proper application for reinstatement of a mammography authorization.\n\n11. In addition to the reinspection fee required under subsection 2 of section 192.764***, if a person violates subsection 1 of this section, the department of health and senior services may impose an administrative penalty against the owner of the radiation machine or, if a lessee of the radiation machine has effective control of the radiation machine, the lessee, of not more than five hundred dollars for each calendar week in which a mammography is performed in violation of subsection 1 of this section. If a person continues to violate subsection 1 of this section for a period of two weeks after a fine is imposed under this subsection, the department shall post a conspicuous notice on the unauthorized radiation machine and at the entry to the facility where the radiation machine is located warning the public that the facility is performing mammography using a radiation machine that is not in compliance with state regulations and may pose a potential hazard to the public health.\n\n12. The attorney general, on request of the department of health and senior services, shall bring an action for injunctive relief to prevent the violation of the provisions of sections 192.760 to 192.766*or rules or regulations promulgated under sections 192.760 to 192.766*.\n\n13. Rules and regulations promulgated by the department of health and senior services pursuant to sections 192.760 to 192.766*shall be fairly consistent with rules promulgated by the Health Care Financing Administration for the Medicare Program: Medicare Coverage of Screening Mammography to implement mammography screening requirements contained in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 721 § 8)\n\n*Words \"sections 3 to 6\" (renumbered 208.175, 208.176, 192.760, 192.762) appear in original rolls, but sections 5 to 8 (renumbered 192.760 to 192.766) seem to be germane, a manifest clerical error.\n\n**Words \"section 4\" (renumbered 208.176) appear in original rolls, but section 6 (renumbered 192.762) seems to be germane, a manifest clerical error.\n\n***Words \"section 5\" (renumbered 192.760) appear in original rolls, but section 7 (renumbered 192.764) seems to be germane, a manifest clerical error.",

Deficiencies, operator informed in exit interview, requirements — plan of correction — categories of standards established — inspection reports made available — notices required. —1. Whenever a duly authorized representative of the department finds upon an inspection of an adult day care program that it is not in compliance with the provisions of sections 192.2200 to 192.2260 and the standards established thereunder, the operator shall be informed of the deficiencies in an exit interview conducted with the operator or his designee. The department shall inform the operator or designee, in writing, of any violation of a class I standard at the time the determination is made. If there was a violation of any class I standard, immediate corrective action shall be taken by the operator or designee and a written plan of correction shall be submitted to the department. A written report shall be prepared of any deficiency and a copy of such report and a written correction order shall be sent to the operator or designee by certified mail or other delivery service that provides a dated receipt of delivery at the adult day care program address within ten working days after the inspection, stating separately each deficiency and the specific statute or regulation violated.\n\n2. The operator or designee shall have five working days following receipt of a written report and correction order regarding a violation of a class I standard and ten working days following receipt of the report and correction order regarding violations of class II or class III standards to submit a plan of correction for the department's approval which contains specific dates for achieving compliance. Within five working days after receiving a plan of correction regarding a violation of a class I standard and within ten working days after receiving a plan of correction regarding a violation of a class II or III standard, the department shall give its written approval or rejection of the plan.\n\n3. If there was a violation of a class I standard, an unannounced reinspection shall be conducted within twenty calendar days of the exit interview to determine if deficiencies have been corrected. If there was a violation of any class II standard and the plan of correction is acceptable, an unannounced reinspection shall be conducted between forty and ninety calendar days from the date of the exit conference to determine the status of all previously cited deficiencies. If there was a violation of class III standards sufficient to establish that the adult day care program was not in substantial compliance, an unannounced reinspection shall be conducted within one hundred twenty days of the exit interview to determine the status of previously identified deficiencies.\n\n4. In establishing standards for each type of adult day care program, the department shall classify the standards into three categories as follows:\n\n(1) Class I standards are standards the violation of which would present either an imminent danger to the health, safety or welfare of any participant or a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm would result;\n\n(2) Class II standards are standards which have a direct or immediate relationship to the health, safety or welfare of any participant, but which do not create imminent danger;\n\n(3) Class III standards are standards which have an indirect or a potential impact on the health, safety or welfare of any participant.\n\n5. Every adult day care program shall make available the most recent inspection report of the adult day care program. If the operator determines that the inspection report of the adult day care program contains individually identifiable health information, the operator may redact such information prior to making the inspection report available.\n\n6. If an adult day care program submits satisfactory documentation that establishes correction of any deficiency contained within the written report of deficiency required by this section*, an on-site revisit of such deficiency may not be required.\n\n7. If, following the reinspection, the adult day care program is found not in substantial compliance with sections 192.2200 to 192.2260 and the standards established thereunder or the operator is not correcting the noncompliance in accordance with the plan of correction, the department shall issue a notice of noncompliance, which shall be sent by certified mail or other delivery service that provides a dated receipt of delivery to the operator of the adult day care program, according to the most recent information or documents on file with the department.\n\n8. The notice of noncompliance shall inform the operator or administrator that the department may seek the imposition of any other action authorized by law.\n\n9. At any time after an inspection is conducted, the operator may choose to enter into a consent agreement with the department to obtain a probationary license. The consent agreement shall include a provision that the operator will voluntarily surrender the license if substantial compliance is not reached in accordance with the terms and deadlines established under the agreement. The agreement shall specify the stages, actions and time span to achieve substantial compliance.\n\n10. Whenever a notice of noncompliance has been issued, the operator shall post a copy of the notice of noncompliance and a copy of the most recent inspection report in a conspicuous location in the adult day care program, and the department shall send a copy of the notice of noncompliance to concerned federal, state or local governmental agencies.\n\n(L. 2014 S.B. 567 § 660.404)\n\n*Section \"600.404\", which does not exist, appears in original rolls.",

Anyone, except any person who has abused or neglected an in-home services client or home health patient, who makes a report pursuant to this section or who testifies in any administrative or judicial proceeding arising from the report shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability for making such a report or for testifying except for liability for perjury, unless such person acted negligently, recklessly, in bad faith, or with malicious purpose.\n\n8. Within five working days after a report required to be made under this section is received, the person making the report shall be notified in writing of its receipt and of the initiation of the investigation.\n\n9. No person who directs or exercises any authority in an in-home services provider agency or home health agency shall harass, dismiss or retaliate against an in-home services client or home health patient, or an in-home services employee or a home health agency employee because he or she or any member of his or her family has made a report of any violation or suspected violation of laws, standards or regulations applying to the in-home services provider agency or home health agency or any in-home services employee or home health agency employee which he or she has reasonable cause to believe has been committed or has occurred.\n\n10. Any person who abuses or neglects an in-home services client or home health patient is subject to criminal prosecution under section 565.184. If such person is an in-home services employee and has been found guilty by a court, and if the supervising in-home services provider willfully and knowingly failed to report known abuse by such employee to the department, the supervising in-home services provider may be subject to administrative penalties of one thousand dollars per violation to be collected by the department and the money received therefor shall be paid to the director of revenue and deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general revenue fund. Any in-home services provider which has had administrative penalties imposed by the department or which has had its contract terminated may seek an administrative review of the department's action pursuant to chapter 621. Any decision of the administrative hearing commission may be appealed to the circuit court in the county where the violation occurred for a trial de novo. For purposes of this subsection, the term\"violation\"means a determination of guilt by a court.\n\n11. The department shall establish a quality assurance and supervision process for clients that requires an in-home services provider agency to conduct random visits to verify compliance with program standards and verify the accuracy of records kept by an in-home services employee.\n\n12. The department shall maintain the employee disqualification list and place on the employee disqualification list the names of any persons who have been finally determined by the department, pursuant to section 192.2490, to have recklessly, knowingly or purposely abused or neglected an in-home services client or home health patient while employed by an in-home services provider agency or home health agency. For purposes of this section only, \"knowingly\" and \"recklessly\" shall have the meanings that are ascribed to them in this section. A person acts\"knowingly\"with respect to the person's conduct when a reasonable person should be aware of the result caused by his or her conduct. A person acts\"recklessly\"when the person consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person's conduct will result in serious physical injury and such disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the situation.\n\n13. At the time a client has been assessed to determine the level of care as required by rule and is eligible for in-home services, the department shall conduct a safe at home evaluation to determine the client's physical, mental, and environmental capacity. The department shall develop the safe at home evaluation tool by rule in accordance with chapter 536. The purpose of the safe at home evaluation is to assure that each client has the appropriate level of services and professionals involved in the client's care. The plan of service or care for each in-home services client shall be authorized by a nurse. The department may authorize the licensed in-home services nurse, in lieu of the department nurse, to conduct the assessment of the client's condition and to establish a plan of services or care. The department may use the expertise, services, or programs of other departments and agencies on a case-by-case basis to establish the plan of service or care. The department may, as indicated by the safe at home evaluation, refer any client to a mental health professional, as defined in 9 CSR 30- 4.030, for evaluation and treatment as necessary.\n\n14. Authorized nurse visits shall occur at least twice annually to assess the client and the client's plan of services. The provider nurse shall report the results of his or her visits to the client's case manager. If the provider nurse believes that the plan of service requires alteration, the department shall be notified and the department shall make a client evaluation. All authorized nurse visits shall be reimbursed to the in-home services provider. All authorized nurse visits shall be reimbursed outside of the nursing home cap for in-home services clients whose services have reached one hundred percent of the average statewide charge for care and treatment in an intermediate care facility, provided that the services have been preauthorized by the department.\n\n15. All in-home services clients shall be advised of their rights by the department or the department's designee at the initial evaluation. The rights shall include, but not be limited to, the right to call the department for any reason, including dissatisfaction with the provider or services. The department may contract for services relating to receiving such complaints. The department shall establish a process to receive such nonabuse and neglect calls other than the elder abuse and neglect hotline.\n\n16. Subject to appropriations, all nurse visits authorized in sections 192.2400 to 192.2475 shall be reimbursed to the in-home services provider agency.\n\n(L. 1992 S.B. 573 & 634, A.L. 2003 S.B. 556 & 311, A.L. 2003 2nd Ex.

Alteration of in-home services provider agency contracts, procedure — letters of censure — staying of suspensions — appeal process. —1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the department of health and senior services proposes to deny, suspend, place on probation, or terminate an in-home services provider agency contract, the department of health and senior services shall serve upon the applicant or contractor written notice of the proposed action to be taken. The notice shall contain a statement of the type of action proposed, the basis for it, the date the action will become effective, and a statement that the applicant or contractor shall have thirty days from the date of mailing or delivery of the notice to file a complaint requesting a hearing before the administrative hearing commission. The administrative hearing commission may consolidate an applicant's or contractor's complaint with any proceeding before the administrative hearing commission filed by such contractor or applicant pursuant to subsection 3 of section 208.156 involving a common question of law or fact. Upon the filing of the complaint, the provisions of sections 621.110, 621.120, 621.125, 621.135, and 621.145 shall apply. With respect to cases in which the department has denied a contract to an in-home services provider agency, the administrative hearing commission shall conduct a hearing to determine the underlying basis for such denial. However, if the administrative hearing commission finds that the contract denial is supported by the facts and the law, the case need not be returned to the department. The administrative hearing commission's decision shall constitute affirmation of the department's contract denial.\n\n2. The department of health and senior services may issue letters of censure or warning without formal notice or hearing.\n\n3. The administrative hearing commission may stay the suspension or termination of an in-home services provider agency's contract, or the placement of the contractor on probation, pending the commission's findings and determination in the cause, upon such conditions, with or without the agreement of the parties, as the commission deems necessary and appropriate, including the posting of bond or other security except that the commission shall not grant a stay, or if a stay has already been entered shall set aside its stay, unless the commission finds that the contractor has established that servicing the MOHealthNet's clients pending the commission's final determination would not present an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of any client or a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm would result. The commission may remove the stay at any time that it finds that the contractor has violated any of the conditions of the stay. Such stay shall remain in effect, unless earlier removed by the commission, pending the decision of the commission and any subsequent departmental action at which time the stay shall be removed. In any case in which the department has refused to issue a contract, the commission shall have no authority to stay or to require the issuance of a contract pending final determination by the commission.\n\n4.

The administrative hearing commission shall make its final decision based upon the circumstances and conditions as they existed at the time of the action of the department and not based upon circumstances and conditions at the time of the hearing or decision of the commission.\n\n6.

For the purpose of this section \"patient or resident\" has the same meaning as such term is defined in section 43.539*.\n\n3. Prior to allowing any person who has been hired as a full-time, part-time or temporary position to have contact with any patient or resident the provider shall, or in the case of temporary employees hired through or contracted for an employment agency, the employment agency shall prior to sending a temporary employee to a provider:\n\n(1) Request a criminal background check as provided in section 43.540. Completion of an inquiry to the highway patrol for criminal records that are available for disclosure to a provider for the purpose of conducting an employee criminal records background check shall be deemed to fulfill the provider's duty to conduct employee criminal background checks pursuant to this section; except that, completing the inquiries pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed to exempt a provider from further inquiry pursuant to common law requirements governing due diligence. If an applicant has not resided in this state for five consecutive years prior to the date of his or her application for employment, the provider shall request a nationwide check for the purpose of determining if the applicant has a prior criminal history in other states. The fingerprint cards and any required fees shall be sent to the highway patrol's central repository. The fingerprints shall be used for searching the state repository of criminal history information. If no identification is made, fingerprints shall be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the searching of the federal criminal history files. The patrol shall notify the submitting state agency of any criminal history information or lack of criminal history information discovered on the individual. The provisions relating to applicants for employment who have not resided in this state for five consecutive years shall apply only to persons who have no employment history with a licensed Missouri facility during that five-year period. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 610.120, all records related to any criminal history information discovered shall be accessible and available to the provider making the record request; and\n\n(2) Make an inquiry to the department of health and senior services whether the person is listed on the employee disqualification list as provided in section 192.2490.\n\n4. When the provider requests a criminal background check pursuant to section 43.540, the requesting entity may require that the applicant reimburse the provider for the cost of such record check. When a provider requests a nationwide criminal background check pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of this section, the total cost to the provider of any background check required pursuant to this section shall not exceed five dollars which shall be paid to the state. State funding and the obligation of a provider to obtain a nationwide criminal background check shall be subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n5. An applicant for a position to have contact with patients or residents of a provider shall:\n\n(1) Sign a consent form as required by section 43.540 so the provider may request a criminal records review;\n\n(2) Disclose the applicant's criminal history. For the purposes of this subdivision\"criminal history\"includes any conviction or a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor or felony charge and shall include any suspended imposition of sentence, any suspended execution of sentence or any period of probation or parole;\n\n(3) Disclose if the applicant is listed on the employee disqualification list as provided in section 192.2490; and\n\n(4) Disclose if the applicant is listed on any of the background checks in the family care safety registry established under section 210.903. A provider not otherwise prohibited from employing an individual listed on such background checks may deny employment to an individual listed on any of the background checks in such registry.\n\n6. An applicant who knowingly fails to disclose his or her criminal history as required in subsection 5 of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. A provider is guilty of a class A misdemeanor if the provider knowingly hires or retains a person to have contact with patients or residents and the person has been found guilty in this state or any other state or has been found guilty of a crime, which if committed in Missouri would be a class A or B felony violation of chapter 565, 566 or 569, or any violation of subsection 3 of section 198.070 or section 568.020.\n\n7. Any in-home services provider agency or home health agency shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor if such agency knowingly employs a person to provide in-home services or home health services to any in-home services client or home health patient and such person either refuses to register with the family care safety registry or if such person:\n\n(1) Has any of the disqualifying factors listed in subsection 6 of this section;\n\n(2) Has been found guilty of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to any felony offense under chapter**195 or 579;\n\n(3) Has been found guilty of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to any felony offense under section 568.045, 568.050, 568.060, 568.175, 570.023, 570.025, 570.030, 570.040 as it existed prior to January 1, 2017, 570.090, 570.145, 570.223, 575.230, or 576.080;\n\n(4) Has been found guilty of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a violation of section 577.010 or 577.012 and who is alleged and found by the court to be an aggravated or chronic offender under section 577.023;\n\n(5) Has been found guilty of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to any offense requiring registration under section 589.400;\n\n(6) Is listed on the department of health and senior services employee disqualification list under section 192.2490;\n\n(7) Is listed on the department of mental health employee disqualification registry under section 630.170; or\n\n(8) Has a finding on the child abuse and neglect registry under sections 210.109 to 210.183.\n\n8. The highway patrol shall examine whether protocols can be developed to allow a provider to request a statewide fingerprint criminal records review check through local law enforcement agencies.\n\n9. A provider may use a private investigatory agency rather than the highway patrol to do a criminal history records review check, and alternatively, the applicant pays the private investigatory agency such fees as the provider and such agency shall agree.\n\n10. Except for the hiring restriction based on the department of health and senior services employee disqualification list established pursuant to section 192.2490, the department of health and senior services shall promulgate rules and regulations to waive the hiring restrictions pursuant to this section for good cause.
