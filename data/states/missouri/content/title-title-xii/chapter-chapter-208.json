Illegal aliens prohibited from receiving any state or local public benefit — proof of lawful residence required — temporary benefits permitted, when — exceptions for nonprofit organizations. —1. No alien unlawfully present in the United States shall receive any state or local public benefit, except for state or local public benefits that may be offered under 8 U.S.C. 1621(b). Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the rendering of emergency medical care, prenatal care, services offering alternatives to abortion, emergency assistance, or legal assistance to any person.\n\n2. As used in this section,\"public benefit\"means any grant, contract, or loan provided by an agency of state or local government; or any retirement, welfare, health, disability, housing, or food assistance benefit under which payments, assistance, credits, or reduced rates or fees are provided. The term \"public benefit\" shall not include postsecondary education public benefits as defined in section 173.1110, any municipal permit, or contracts or agreements between public utility providers and their customers or unemployment benefits payable under chapter 288. The unemployment compensation program shall verify the lawful presence of an alien for the purpose of determining eligibility for benefits in accordance with its own procedures.\n\n3. In addition to providing proof of other eligibility requirements, at the time of application for any state or local public benefit, an applicant who is eighteen years of age or older shall provide affirmative proof that the applicant is a citizen or a permanent resident of the United States or is lawfully present in the United States. Such affirmative proof shall include documentary evidence recognized by the department of revenue when processing an application for a driver's license, a Missouri driver's license, as well as any document issued by the federal government that confirms an alien's lawful presence in the United States. In processing applications for public benefits, an employee of an agency of state or local government shall not inquire about the legal status of a custodial parent or guardian applying for a public benefit on behalf of his or her dependent child who is a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.\n\n4. An applicant who cannot provide the proof required under this section at the time of application may alternatively sign an affidavit under oath, attesting to either United States citizenship or classification by the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, in order to receive temporary benefits or a temporary identification document as provided in this section. The affidavit shall be on or consistent with forms prepared by the state or local government agency administering the state or local public benefits and shall include the applicant's Social Security number or any applicable federal identification number and an explanation of the penalties under state law for obtaining public assistance benefits fraudulently.\n\n5. An applicant who has provided the sworn affidavit required under subsection 4 of this section is eligible to receive temporary public benefits as follows:\n\n(1) For ninety days or until such time that it is determined that the applicant is not lawfully present in the United States, whichever is earlier; or\n\n(2) Indefinitely if the applicant provides a copy of a completed application for a birth certificate that is pending in Missouri or some other state. An extension granted under this subsection shall terminate upon the applicant's receipt of a birth certificate or a determination that a birth certificate does not exist because the applicant is not a United States citizen.\n\n6. An applicant who is an alien shall not receive any state or local public benefit unless the alien's lawful presence in the United States is first verified by the federal government. State and local agencies administering public benefits in this state shall cooperate with the United States Department of Homeland Security in achieving verification of an alien's lawful presence in the United States in furtherance of this section. The system utilized may include the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program operated by the United States Department of Homeland Security. After an applicant's lawful presence in the United States has been verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program, no additional verification is required within the same agency of the state or local government.\n\n7. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to require any nonprofit organization duly registered with the Internal Revenue Service to enforce the provisions of this section, nor does it prohibit such an organization from providing aid.\n\n8.

Eligibility for public assistance, how determined — ineligibility for benefits, when — allowable exclusions — prevention of spousal impoverishments, division of assets, community spouse defined — burial lots defined — diversion of institutionalized spouse's income. —1. In determining the eligibility of a claimant for public assistance pursuant to this law, it shall be the duty of the family support division to consider and take into account all facts and circumstances surrounding the claimant, including his or her living conditions, earning capacity, income and resources, from whatever source received, and if from all the facts and circumstances the claimant is not found to be in need, assistance shall be denied. In determining the need of a claimant, the costs of providing medical treatment which may be furnished pursuant to sections 208.151 to 208.158 shall be disregarded. The amount of benefits, when added to all other income, resources, support, and maintenance shall provide such persons with reasonable subsistence compatible with decency and health in accordance with the standards developed by the family support division; provided, when a husband and wife are living together, the combined income and resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of either or both.\"Living together\"for the purpose of this chapter is defined as including a husband and wife separated for the purpose of obtaining medical care or nursing home care, except that the income of a husband or wife separated for such purpose shall be considered in determining the eligibility of his or her spouse, only to the extent that such income exceeds the amount necessary to meet the needs (as defined by rule or regulation of the division) of such husband or wife living separately. In determining the need of a claimant in federally aided programs there shall be disregarded such amounts per month of earned income in making such determination as shall be required for federal participation by the provisions of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. Section 301, et seq.), or any amendments thereto. When federal law or regulations require the exemption of other income or resources, the family support division may provide by rule or regulation the amount of income or resources to be disregarded.\n\n2. Benefits shall not be payable to any claimant who:\n\n(1) Has or whose spouse with whom he or she is living has, prior to July 1, 1989, given away or sold a resource within the time and in the manner specified in this subdivision.

A claimant ineligible pursuant to this subsection shall be ineligible for such period of time from the date of discovery as the family support division may deem proper; or in the case of overpayment of benefits, future benefits may be decreased, suspended or entirely withdrawn for such period of time as the division may deem proper;\n\n(4) Owns or possesses resources in the sum of one thousand dollars or more; provided, however, that if such person is married and living with spouse, he or she, or they, individually or jointly, may own resources not to exceed two thousand dollars; and provided further, that in the case of a temporary assistance for needy families claimant, a MO HealthNet blind claimant, a MO HealthNet aged claimant, or a MO HealthNet permanent and total disability claimant, the provision of this subsection shall not apply;\n\n(5) Prior to October 1, 1989, owns or possesses property of any kind or character, excluding amounts placed in an irrevocable prearranged funeral or burial contract under chapter 436, or has an interest in property, of which he or she is the record or beneficial owner, the value of such property, as determined by the family support division, less encumbrances of record, exceeds twenty-nine thousand dollars, or if married and actually living together with husband or wife, if the value of his or her property, or the value of his or her interest in property, together with that of such husband and wife, exceeds such amount;\n\n(6) In the case of temporary assistance for needy families, if the parent, stepparent, and child or children in the home owns or possesses property of any kind or character, or has an interest in property for which he or she is a record or beneficial owner, the value of such property, as determined by the family support division and as allowed by federal law or regulation, less encumbrances of record, exceeds one thousand dollars, excluding the home occupied by the claimant, amounts placed in an irrevocable prearranged funeral or burial contract under chapter 436, one automobile which shall not exceed a value set forth by federal law or regulation and for a period not to exceed six months, such other real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to sell, if the family agrees in writing with the family support division to sell such property and from the net proceeds of the sale repay the amount of assistance received during such period. If the property has not been sold within six months, or if eligibility terminates for any other reason, the entire amount of assistance paid during such period shall be a debt due the state;\n\n(7) In the case of MO HealthNet blind claimants, MO HealthNet aged claimants, and MO HealthNet permanent and total disability claimants, starting in fiscal year 2018, owns or possesses resources not to exceed two thousand dollars; provided, however, that if such person is married and living with spouse, he or she, or they, individually or jointly, may own resources not to exceed four thousand dollars except for medical savings accounts and independent living accounts as defined and limited under subsection 3 of section 208.146. These resource limits shall be increased annually by one thousand dollars and two thousand dollars respectively until the sum of resources reach the amount of five thousand dollars and ten thousand dollars respectively by fiscal year 2021. Beginning in fiscal year 2022 and each successive fiscal year thereafter, the division shall measure the cost-of-living percentage increase, if any, as of the preceding July over the level as of July of the immediately preceding year of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or successor index published by the U.S. Department of Labor or its successor agency, and the sum of resources allowed under this subdivision shall be modified accordingly to reflect any increases in the cost-of-living, with the amount of the resource limit rounded to the nearest five cents;\n\n(8) Is an inmate of a public institution, except as a patient in a public medical institution.\n\n3.

In determining eligibility and the amount of benefits to be granted pursuant to federally aided programs, the value of burial lots or any amounts placed in an irrevocable prearranged funeral or burial contract under chapter 436 shall not be taken into account or considered an asset of the burial lot owner or the beneficiary of an irrevocable prearranged funeral or funeral contract. For purposes of this section,\"burial lots\"means any burial space as defined in section 214.270 and any memorial, monument, marker, tombstone or letter marking a burial space. If the beneficiary, as defined in chapter 436, of an irrevocable prearranged funeral or burial contract receives any public assistance benefits pursuant to this chapter and if the purchaser of such contract or his or her successors in interest transfer, amend, or take any other such actions regarding the contract so that any person will be entitled to a refund, such refund shall be paid to the state of Missouri with any amount in excess of the public assistance benefits provided under this chapter to be refunded by the state of Missouri to the purchaser or his or her successors. In determining eligibility and the amount of benefits to be granted under federally aided programs, the value of any life insurance policy where a seller or provider is made the beneficiary or where the life insurance policy is assigned to a seller or provider, either being in consideration for an irrevocable prearranged funeral contract under chapter 436, shall not be taken into account or considered an asset of the beneficiary of the irrevocable prearranged funeral contract. In addition, the value of any funds, up to nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, placed into an irrevocable personal funeral trust account, where the trustee of the irrevocable personal funeral trust account is a state or federally chartered financial institution authorized to exercise trust powers in the state of Missouri, shall not be taken into account or considered an asset of the person whose funds are so deposited if such funds are restricted to be used only for the burial, funeral, preparation of the body, or other final disposition of the person whose funds were deposited into said personal funeral trust account. No person or entity shall charge more than ten percent of the total amount deposited into a personal funeral trust in order to create or set up said personal funeral trust, and any fees charged for the maintenance of such a personal funeral trust shall not exceed three percent of the trust assets annually. Trustees may commingle funds from two or more such personal funeral trust accounts so long as accurate books and records are kept as to the value, deposits, and disbursements of each individual depositor's funds and trustees are to use the prudent investor standard as to the investment of any funds placed into a personal funeral trust. If the person whose funds are deposited into the personal funeral trust account receives any public assistance benefits pursuant to this chapter and any funds in the personal funeral trust account are, for any reason, not spent on the burial, funeral, preparation of the body, or other final disposition of the person whose funds were deposited into the trust account, such funds shall be paid to the state of Missouri with any amount in excess of the public assistance benefits provided under this chapter to be refunded by the state of Missouri to the person who received public assistance benefits or his or her successors. No contract with any cemetery, funeral establishment, or any provider or seller shall be required in regards to funds placed into a personal funeral trust account as set out in this subsection.\n\n5.

Beginning September 30, 1989, when determining the eligibility of institutionalized spouses, as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-5, for medical assistance benefits as provided for in section 208.151 and 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396a, et seq., the family support division shall comply with the provisions of the federal statutes and regulations. As necessary, the division shall by rule or regulation implement the federal law and regulations which shall include but not be limited to the establishment of income and resource standards and limitations. The division shall require:\n\n(1) That at the beginning of a period of continuous institutionalization that is expected to last for thirty days or more, the institutionalized spouse, or the community spouse, may request an assessment by the family support division of total countable resources owned by either or both spouses;\n\n(2) That the assessed resources of the institutionalized spouse and the community spouse may be allocated so that each receives an equal share;\n\n(3) That upon an initial eligibility determination, if the community spouse's share does not equal at least twelve thousand dollars, the institutionalized spouse may transfer to the community spouse a resource allowance to increase the community spouse's share to twelve thousand dollars;\n\n(4) That in the determination of initial eligibility of the institutionalized spouse, no resources attributed to the community spouse shall be used in determining the eligibility of the institutionalized spouse, except to the extent that the resources attributed to the community spouse do exceed the community spouse's resource allowance as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-5;\n\n(5) That beginning in January, 1990, the amount specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers between September, 1988, and the September before the calendar year involved; and\n\n(6) That beginning the month after initial eligibility for the institutionalized spouse is determined, the resources of the community spouse shall not be considered available to the institutionalized spouse during that continuous period of institutionalization.\n\n7. Beginning July 1, 1989, institutionalized individuals shall be ineligible for the periods required and for the reasons specified in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p.\n\n8. The hearings required by 42 U.S.C.

A\"community spouse\"is defined as being the noninstitutionalized spouse.\n\n12. An institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid and having a spouse living in the community shall be required, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to divert income to such community spouse to raise the community spouse's income to the level of the minimum monthly needs allowance, as described in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-5. Such diversion of income shall occur before the community spouse is allowed to retain assets in excess of the community spouse protected amount described in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-5.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 9406, A.L. 1943 p. 950, A.L. 1949 p. 597, A.L. 1953 p. 644, A.L. 1955 p. 688, A.L. 1957 p. 694, A.L. 1959 H.B. 131, A.L. 1963 p. 377, A.L. 1965 1st Ex.

Carlisle v. State Department of Public Health and Welfare (A.), 341 S.W.2d 617\n\n(1962) Director of welfare acted arbitrarily in determining eligibility of claimant and failed to grant fair hearing by refusing to consider evidence as to equitable ownership of property. Claimant was not required to establish by court action that beneficial ownership of property was in another. Powers v. State Department of Public Health and Welfare (A.), 359 S.W.2d 33.\n\n(1962) Claimant's execution of a deed of trust against his property to secure a loan for $2,000 of which $1,000 went to his daughter-in-law and balance was used to pay off claimant's prior indebtedness secured by the property and the interest payments were paid by daughter-in-law, did not render claimant ineligible for benefits. Dysart v. State Dept. of Public Health & Welfare (A.), 361 S.W.2d 347.\n\n(1962) Director's decision that claimants were ineligible for old age assistance in that they had sold real estate in which they had one-half interest without receiving anything of value therefor was not supported where uncontradicted evidence was that claimants had been made joint tenants with their daughter to prevent daughter's divorced husband acquiring an interest therein and there was no evidence that claimants had paid anything on purchase price. Velghe v. State Dept. of Public Health and Welfare (A.), 362 S.W.2d 747.\n\n(1964) Finding of director that applicant for old age assistance had transferred $1500 to daughter without receiving fair and valuable consideration was based upon substantial evidence and decision denying compensation was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Dunnegan v. Gallop (A.), 374 S.W.2d 407.\n\n(1972) Finding by director of public health and welfare that transfer of life estate of 68 year old claimant in business building which was in state of disrepair and disuse and encumbered by $1,500 in back taxes for payment of $50 for each month of her life with a minimum total payment of $1,000 was made without fair and valuable consideration was arbitrary and unreasonable. Davis v. State Dept. of Public Health and Welfare (A.), S.W.2d 775.\n\n(1973) Held, verbal promise to pay for land conveyed by deed is within statutory definition of \"fair and valuable consideration.\" Hill v. State Dept. of Public Health & Welfare (Mo. Banc), 503 S.W.2d 6.\n\n(1975) Evidence held not to sustain a finding that property was transferred without fair and valuable consideration. Value of undivided interest of a cotenant out of possession is not necessarily one-half of market value. Brumit v. State Department of Public Health and Welfare (Mo.), 521 S.W.2d 445.\n\n(1985) In determining entitlement to medical assistance to pay for the cost of residential care, the director may not consider the value of the assets of a spendthrift trust where the settlor intended that the payments from the trust to his retarded son were to supplement rather than supplant benefits to which the son would otherwise be entitled.

Temporary assistance benefits — eligibility for — assignment of rights to support to state, when, effect of — authorized policies. —1. Temporary assistance benefits shall be granted on behalf of a dependent child or children and may be granted to the parents or other needy eligible relative caring for a dependent child or children who:\n\n(1) Is under the age of eighteen years; or is under the age of nineteen years and a full-time student in a secondary school (or at the equivalent level of vocational or technical training), if before the child attains the age of nineteen the child may reasonably be expected to complete the program of the secondary school (or vocational or technical training);\n\n(2) Has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew or niece, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as the child's own home, and financial aid for such child is necessary to save the child from neglect and to secure for the child proper care in such home. Physical or mental incapacity shall be certified to by competent medical or other appropriate authority designated by the family support division, and such certificate is hereby declared to be competent evidence in any proceedings concerning the eligibility of such claimant to receive temporary assistance benefits. Benefits may be granted and continued for this reason only while it is the judgment of the family support division that a physical or mental defect, illness or disability exists which prevents the parent from performing any gainful work;\n\n(3) Is not receiving supplemental aid to the blind, blind pension, supplemental payments, or aid or public relief as an unemployable person;\n\n(4) Is a resident of the state of Missouri.\n\n2. The family support division shall require as additional conditions of eligibility for benefits that each applicant for or recipient of assistance:\n\n(1) Shall furnish to the division the applicant's or recipient's Social Security number or numbers, if the applicant or recipient has more than one such number;\n\n(2) Shall assign to the family support division in behalf of the state any rights to support from any other person such applicant may have in the applicant's own behalf or in behalf of any other person for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving assistance. An application for benefits made under this section shall constitute an assignment of support rights which shall take effect, by operation of law, upon a determination that the applicant is eligible for assistance under this section. The assignment shall comply with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Section 608(a)(3) and authorizes the family support division of the department of social services to bring any administrative or judicial action to establish or enforce a current support obligation, to collect support arrearages accrued under an existing order for support, or to seek reimbursement of support provided by the division;\n\n(3) Shall cooperate with the family support division unless the division determines in accordance with federally prescribed standards that such cooperation is contrary to the best interests of the child on whose behalf assistance is claimed or to the caretaker of such child, in establishing the paternity of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom assistance is claimed, and in obtaining support payments for such applicant and for a child with respect to whom such assistance is claimed, or in obtaining any other payments or property due such applicant or such child. The family support division shall impose all penalties allowed pursuant to federal participation requirements;\n\n(4) Shall cooperate with the department of social services in identifying and providing information to assist the state in pursuing any third party who may be liable to pay for care and services available under the state's plan for medical assistance as provided in section 208.152, unless such individual has good cause for refusing to cooperate as determined by the department of social services in accordance with federally prescribed standards; and\n\n(5) Shall participate in any program designed to reduce the recipient's dependence on welfare, if requested to do so by the department of social services.\n\n3. The division shall require as a condition of eligibility for temporary assistance benefits that a minor child under the age of eighteen who has never married and who has a dependent child in his or her care, or who is pregnant and otherwise eligible for temporary assistance benefits, shall reside in a place of residence maintained by a parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative or in some other adult-supervised supportive living arrangement, as required by Section 403 of P.L. 100-485. Exceptions to the requirements of this subsection shall be allowed in accordance with requirements of the federal Family Support Act of 1988 in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The individual has no parent or legal guardian who is living or the whereabouts of the individual's parent or legal guardian is unknown; or\n\n(2) The family support division determines that the physical health or safety of the individual or the child of the individual would be jeopardized; or\n\n(3) The individual has lived apart from any parent or legal guardian for a period of at least one year prior to the birth of the child or applying for benefits; or\n\n(4) The individual claims to be or to have been the victim of abuse while residing in the home where she would be required to reside and the case has been referred to the child abuse hotline and a \"reason to suspect finding\" has been made.\n\n­­Households where the individual resides with a parent, legal guardian or other adult relative or in some other adult-supervised supportive living arrangement shall, subject to federal waiver to retain full federal financial participation and appropriation, have earned income disregarded from eligibility determinations up to one hundred percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n4. If the relative with whom a child is living is found to be ineligible because of refusal to cooperate as required in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, any assistance for which such child is eligible will be paid in the manner provided in subsection 2 of section 208.180, without regard to subsections 1 and 2 of this section.\n\n5. The department of social services may implement policies designed to reduce a family's dependence on welfare. The department of social services is authorized to implement these policies by rule promulgated pursuant to section 660.017 and chapter 536, including the following:\n\n(1) The department shall increase the earned income and resource disregards allowed recipients to help families achieve a gradual transition to self-sufficiency, including implementing policies to simplify employment-related eligibility standards by increasing the earned income disregard to two-thirds by October 1, 1999. The expanded earned income disregard shall apply only to recipients of cash assistance who obtain employment but not to new applicants for cash assistance who are already working. Once the individual has received the two-thirds disregard for twelve months, the individual would not be eligible for the two-thirds disregard until the individual has not received temporary assistance benefits for twelve consecutive months. The department shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 536 to implement the expanded earned income disregard provisions;\n\n(2) The department shall permit a recipient's enrollment in educational programs beyond secondary education to qualify as a work activity for purposes of receipt of temporary assistance for needy families. Such education beyond secondary education shall qualify as a work activity if such recipient is attending and according to the standards of the institution and the family support division, making satisfactory progress towards completion of a postsecondary or vocational program. Weekly classroom time and allowable study time shall be applied toward the recipient's weekly work requirement. Such recipient shall be subject to the forty-five-month lifetime limit for receipt of temporary assistance for needy families unless otherwise excluded by rule of the family support division;\n\n(3) Beginning January 1, 2002, and every two years thereafter, the department of social services shall make a detailed report and a presentation on the temporary assistance for needy families program to the house appropriations for social services committee and the house social services, Medicaid and the elderly committee, and the senate aging, families and mental health committee, or comparable committees;\n\n(4) Other policies designed to reduce a family's dependence on welfare may include supplementing wages for recipients for the lesser of forty-eight months or the length of the recipient's employment by diverting the temporary assistance grant;\n\n(5) Beginning January 1, 2016, the lifetime limit for temporary assistance for needy families shall be forty-five months. The lifetime limit shall not apply to the exceptions set forth in 42 U.S.C. Section 608(a)(7), including but not limited to:\n\n(a) Any assistance provided with respect to and during the time in which the individual was a minor child, provided that the minor child was not the head of a household or married to the head of a household; and\n\n(b) Any family to which the state has granted an exemption for reasons of hardship or if the family includes an individual who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, provided that the average monthly number of such families in a fiscal year shall not exceed twenty percent of the average monthly number of families to which temporary assistance for needy families is provided during the fiscal year or the immediately preceding fiscal year.\n\n­­The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to persons obtaining assistance under subdivision (6) of this subsection;\n\n(6) Beginning January 1, 2016, the department shall implement a cash diversion program that grants eligible temporary assistance for needy families benefits recipients lump-sum cash grants for short-term needs, as well as job referrals or referrals to career centers, in lieu of signing up for the long-term monthly cash assistance program upon a showing of good cause as determined by the department. Such lump-sum grants shall be available for use once in a twelve-month period and only five instances in a lifetime. Good cause may include loss of employment, excluding voluntarily quitting or a dismissal due to poor job performance or failure to meet a condition of employment; catastrophic illness or accident of a family member that requires an employed recipient to leave employment; a domestic violence incident; or another situation or emergency that renders an employed family member unable to care for the basic needs of the family. The department shall promulgate rules determining the parameters for the diversion program, including good cause determinations, and shall set the lump-sum maximum limit at three times the family size allowance and for use once in a twelve-month period and only five instances in a lifetime; and\n\n(7) The department shall develop a standardized program orientation for temporary assistance for needy families benefits applicants that informs applicants of the program's rules and requirements, available resources for work activities, and consequences if the program's requirements are not satisfied. Following the orientation, applicants shall sign a participation agreement in which applicants commit to participate in the program and specify the work activities in which they will participate. This participation agreement shall be known as a personal responsibility plan. The department shall not issue a case without confirmation that an applicant has undergone the orientation and signed a personal responsibility plan, unless the individual is otherwise exempt from the work activity requirements.\n\n­­The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to compliance by the department with all applicable federal laws and rules regarding temporary assistance for needy families.\n\n6. The work history requirements and definition of unemployed shall not apply to any parents in order for these parents to be eligible for assistance pursuant to section 208.041.\n\n7. The department shall continue to apply uniform standards of eligibility and benefits, excepting pilot projects, in all political subdivisions of the state.\n\n8. Consistent with federal law, the department shall establish income and resource eligibility requirements that are no more restrictive than its July 16, 1996, income and resource eligibility requirements in determining eligibility for temporary assistance benefits.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 9408, A.L. 1941 p. 645, A.L. 1949 p. 589, A.L. 1951 p. 755, A.L. 1953 p. 642, A.L. 1955 p. 691, A.L. 1957 p. 696, A.L. 1973 S.B. 303, A.L. 1977 H.B. 601, A.L. 1982 S.B. 468 merged with H.B. 1462, A.L. 1983 H.B. 713 Revision, A.L. 1984 H.B. 1275, A.L. 1987 H.B. 518, A.L. 1994 H.B. 1547 & 961, A.L. 1999 S.B. 387, et al., A.L. 2001 S.B. 236, A.L. 2009 H.B. 481, A.L. 2015 S.B. 24)\n\n*S.B. 24 was vetoed 4-30-15.

In order to more effectively transition persons receiving state-funded child care subsidy benefits under this chapter, the department of elementary and secondary education shall, subject to appropriations, by July 1, 2024, implement a program to allow recipients to receive transitional child care benefits without the requirement that such recipients first be eligible for full child care benefits.\n\n(1) For purposes of this section,\"full child care benefits\"shall be the full benefits awarded to a recipient based on the income eligibility amount established by the department through the annual appropriations process as of August 28, 2023, to qualify for the benefits and shall not include the transitional child care benefits that are awarded to recipients whose income surpasses the eligibility level for full benefits to continue. The program shall be voluntary and shall be designed such that a recipient may begin receiving the transitional child care benefit without having first qualified for the full child care benefit or any other tier of the transitional child care benefit.\n\n(2) Transitional child care benefits shall be determined on a sliding scale as follows for recipients with household incomes in excess of the eligibility level for full benefits:\n\n(a) Eighty percent of the state base rate for recipients with household incomes greater than the eligibility level for full benefits but less than or equal to one hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level;\n\n(b) Sixty percent of the state base rate for recipients with household incomes greater than one hundred fifty percent but less than or equal to one hundred seventy percent of the federal poverty level;\n\n(c) Forty percent of the state base rate for recipients with household incomes greater than one hundred seventy percent but less than or equal to one hundred ninety percent of the federal poverty level; and\n\n(d) Twenty percent of the state base rate for recipients with household incomes greater than one hundred ninety percent but less than or equal to two hundred percent of the federal poverty level, but not greater than eighty-five percent of the state median income.\n\n(3) As used in this section,\"state base rate\"shall refer to the rate established by the department for provider payments that accounts for geographic area, type of facility, duration of care, and age of the child, as well as any enhancements reflecting after-hours or weekend care, accreditation, or licensure status, as determined by the department. Recipients shall be responsible for paying the remaining sliding fee to the child care provider.\n\n(4) A participating recipient shall be allowed to opt out of the program at any time, but such person shall not be allowed to participate in the program a second time.\n\n2. The department shall track the number of participants in the program and shall issue an annual report to the general assembly by September 1, 2025, and annually on September first thereafter, detailing the effectiveness of the program in encouraging recipients to secure employment earning an income greater than the maximum wage eligible for the full child care benefit. The report shall also detail the costs of administration and the increased amount of state income tax paid as a result of the program.\n\n3. The department shall pursue all necessary waivers from the federal government to implement the program. If the department is unable to obtain such waivers, the department shall implement the program to the degree possible without such waivers.\n\n4.

Section 1396a(f), or less restrictive methodologies as contained in the MO HealthNet state plan as of January 1, 2005, except that less restrictive income methodologies, as authorized in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(r)(2), shall be used to raise the income limit to one hundred percent of the federal poverty level;\n\n(c) All persons who would be determined to be eligible for permanent and total disability benefits under the eligibility standards in effect December 31, 1973, as authorized by 42 U.S.C.

Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII). Such persons shall be eligible during a period of presumptive eligibility in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-1. A person who receives a breast or cervical cancer screening service of a type that is within the scope of screening services under Title XV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.

Section 1396a(e)(16). The department shall submit a state plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services when the number of ineligible MO HealthNet participants removed from the program in 2023 pursuant to section 208.239 exceeds the projected number of beneficiaries likely to enroll in benefits in 2023 under this subdivision and subdivision (2) of subsection 6 of section 208.662, as determined by the department, by at least one hundred individuals;\n\n(b) The provisions of this subdivision shall remain in effect for any period of time during which the federal authority under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(e)(16), as amended, or any successor statutes or implementing regulations, is in effect.\n\n2. Rules and regulations to implement this section shall be promulgated in accordance with chapter 536. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2002, shall be invalid and void.\n\n3. After December 31, 1973, and before April 1, 1990, any family eligible for assistance pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 601, et seq., as amended, in at least three of the last six months immediately preceding the month in which such family became ineligible for such assistance because of increased income from employment shall, while a member of such family is employed, remain eligible for MO HealthNet benefits for four calendar months following the month in which such family would otherwise be determined to be ineligible for such assistance because of income and resource limitation. After April 1, 1990, any family receiving aid pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 601, et seq., as amended, in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such family becomes ineligible for such aid, because of hours of employment or income from employment of the caretaker relative, shall remain eligible for MO HealthNet benefits for six calendar months following the month of such ineligibility as long as such family includes a child as provided in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-6.

Section 1396r-6 shall receive MO HealthNet benefits without fee for an additional six months. The MO HealthNet division may provide by rule and as authorized by annual appropriation the scope of MO HealthNet coverage to be granted to such families.\n\n4. When any individual has been determined to be eligible for MO HealthNet benefits, such medical assistance will be made available to him or her for care and services furnished in or after the third month before the month in which he made application for such assistance if such individual was, or upon application would have been, eligible for such assistance at the time such care and services were furnished; provided, further, that such medical expenses remain unpaid.\n\n5. The department of social services may apply to the federal Department of Health and Human Services for a MO HealthNet waiver amendment to the Section 1115 demonstration waiver or for any additional MO HealthNet waivers necessary not to exceed one million dollars in additional costs to the state, unless subject to appropriation or directed by statute, but in no event shall such waiver applications or amendments seek to waive the services of a rural health clinic or a federally qualified health center as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(l)(1) and (2) or the payment requirements for such clinics and centers as provided in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(15) and 1396a(bb) unless such waiver application is approved by the oversight committee created in section 208.955. A request for such a waiver so submitted shall only become effective by executive order not sooner than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the general assembly to which it is submitted, unless it is disapproved within sixty days of its submission to a regular session by a senate or house resolution adopted by a majority vote of the respective elected members thereof, unless the request for such a waiver is made subject to appropriation or directed by statute.\n\n6.

      "text": "Title XII PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nChapter 208\n\n208.152. Medical services for which payment shall be made — co-payments may be required — reimbursement for services — notification upon change in interpretation or application of reimbursement — reimbursement for behavioral, social, and psychological services for physical health issues. —1. MO HealthNet payments shall be made on behalf of those eligible needy persons as described in section 208.151 who are unable to provide for it in whole or in part, with any payments to be made on the basis of the reasonable cost of the care or reasonable charge for the services as defined and determined by the MO HealthNet division, unless otherwise hereinafter provided, for the following:\n\n(1) Inpatient hospital services, except to persons in an institution for mental diseases who are under the age of sixty-five years and over the age of twenty-one years; provided that the MO HealthNet division shall provide through rule and regulation an exception process for coverage of inpatient costs in those cases requiring treatment beyond the seventy-fifth percentile professional activities study (PAS) or the MO HealthNet children's diagnosis length-of-stay schedule; and provided further that the MO HealthNet division shall take into account through its payment system for hospital services the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients;\n\n(2) All outpatient hospital services, payments therefor to be in amounts which represent no more than eighty percent of the lesser of reasonable costs or customary charges for such services, determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Title XVIII A and B, Public Law 89-97, 1965 amendments to the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 301, et seq.), but the MO HealthNet division may evaluate outpatient hospital services rendered under this section and deny payment for services which are determined by the MO HealthNet division not to be medically necessary, in accordance with federal law and regulations;\n\n(3) Laboratory and X-ray services;\n\n(4) Nursing home services for participants, except to persons with more than five hundred thousand dollars equity in their home or except for persons in an institution for mental diseases who are under the age of sixty-five years, when residing in a hospital licensed by the department of health and senior services or a nursing home licensed by the department of health and senior services or appropriate licensing authority of other states or government-owned and -operated institutions which are determined to conform to standards equivalent to licensing requirements in Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq.), as amended, for nursing facilities. The MO HealthNet division may recognize through its payment methodology for nursing facilities those nursing facilities which serve a high volume of MO HealthNet patients. The MO HealthNet division when determining the amount of the benefit payments to be made on behalf of persons under the age of twenty-one in a nursing facility may consider nursing facilities furnishing care to persons under the age of twenty-one as a classification separate from other nursing facilities;\n\n(5) Nursing home costs for participants receiving benefit payments under subdivision (4) of this subsection for those days, which shall not exceed twelve per any period of six consecutive months, during which the participant is on a temporary leave of absence from the hospital or nursing home, provided that no such participant shall be allowed a temporary leave of absence unless it is specifically provided for in his plan of care. As used in this subdivision, the term\"temporary leave of absence\"shall include all periods of time during which a participant is away from the hospital or nursing home overnight because he is visiting a friend or relative;\n\n(6) Physicians' services, whether furnished in the office, home, hospital, nursing home, or elsewhere, provided, that no funds shall be expended to any abortion facility, as defined in section 188.015, or to any affiliate, as defined in section 188.015, of such abortion facility;\n\n(7) Subject to appropriation, up to twenty visits per year for services limited to examinations, diagnoses, adjustments, and manipulations and treatments of malpositioned articulations and structures of the body provided by licensed chiropractic physicians practicing within their scope of practice. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to otherwise expand MO HealthNet services;\n\n(8) Drugs and medicines when prescribed by a licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist, or an advanced practice registered nurse; except that no payment for drugs and medicines prescribed on and after January 1, 2006, by a licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist, or an advanced practice registered nurse may be made on behalf of any person who qualifies for prescription drug coverage under the provisions of P.L. 108-173;\n\n(9) Emergency ambulance services and, effective January 1, 1990, medically necessary transportation to scheduled, physician-prescribed nonelective treatments;\n\n(10) Early and periodic screening and diagnosis of individuals who are under the age of twenty-one to ascertain their physical or mental defects, and health care, treatment, and other measures to correct or ameliorate defects and chronic conditions discovered thereby. Such services shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 6403 of P.L. 101-239 and federal regulations promulgated thereunder;\n\n(11) Home health care services;\n\n(12) Family planning as defined by federal rules and regulations; provided, that no funds shall be expended to any abortion facility, as defined in section 188.015, or to any affiliate, as defined in section 188.015, of such abortion facility; and further provided, however, that such family planning services shall not include abortions or any abortifacient drug or device that is used for the purpose of inducing an abortion unless such abortions are certified in writing by a physician to the MO HealthNet agency that, in the physician's professional judgment, the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term;\n\n(13) Inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age twenty-one as defined in Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396d, et seq.);\n\n(14) Outpatient surgical procedures, including presurgical diagnostic services performed in ambulatory surgical facilities which are licensed by the department of health and senior services of the state of Missouri; except, that such outpatient surgical services shall not include persons who are eligible for coverage under Part B of Title XVIII, Public Law 89-97, 1965 amendments to the federal Social Security Act, as amended, if exclusion of such persons is permitted under Title XIX, Public Law 89-97, 1965 amendments to the federal Social Security Act, as amended;\n\n(15) Personal care services which are medically oriented tasks having to do with a person's physical requirements, as opposed to housekeeping requirements, which enable a person to be treated by his or her physician on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient or residential basis in a hospital, intermediate care facility, or skilled nursing facility. Personal care services shall be rendered by an individual not a member of the participant's family who is qualified to provide such services where the services are prescribed by a physician in accordance with a plan of treatment and are supervised by a licensed nurse. Persons eligible to receive personal care services shall be those persons who would otherwise require placement in a hospital, intermediate care facility, or skilled nursing facility. Benefits payable for personal care services shall not exceed for any one participant one hundred percent of the average statewide charge for care and treatment in an intermediate care facility for a comparable period of time. Such services, when delivered in a residential care facility or assisted living facility licensed under chapter 198 shall be authorized on a tier level based on the services the resident requires and the frequency of the services. A resident of such facility who qualifies for assistance under section 208.030 shall, at a minimum, if prescribed by a physician, qualify for the tier level with the fewest services. The rate paid to providers for each tier of service shall be set subject to appropriations. Subject to appropriations, each resident of such facility who qualifies for assistance under section 208.030 and meets the level of care required in this section shall, at a minimum, if prescribed by a physician, be authorized up to one hour of personal care services per day. Authorized units of personal care services shall not be reduced or tier level lowered unless an order approving such reduction or lowering is obtained from the resident's personal physician. Such authorized units of personal care services or tier level shall be transferred with such resident if he or she transfers to another such facility. Such provision shall terminate upon receipt of relevant waivers from the federal Department of Health and Human Services. If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines that such provision does not comply with the state plan, this provision shall be null and void. The MO HealthNet division shall notify the revisor of statutes as to whether the relevant waivers are approved or a determination of noncompliance is made;\n\n(16) Mental health services. The state plan for providing medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq., as amended, shall include the following mental health services when such services are provided by community mental health facilities operated by the department of mental health or designated by the department of mental health as a community mental health facility or as an alcohol and drug abuse facility or as a child-serving agency within the comprehensive children's mental health service system established in section 630.097. The department of mental health shall establish by administrative rule the definition and criteria for designation as a community mental health facility and for designation as an alcohol and drug abuse facility. Such mental health services shall include:\n\n(a) Outpatient mental health services including preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and palliative interventions rendered to individuals in an individual or group setting by a mental health professional in accordance with a plan of treatment appropriately established, implemented, monitored, and revised under the auspices of a therapeutic team as a part of client services management;\n\n(b) Clinic mental health services including preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and palliative interventions rendered to individuals in an individual or group setting by a mental health professional in accordance with a plan of treatment appropriately established, implemented, monitored, and revised under the auspices of a therapeutic team as a part of client services management;\n\n(c) Rehabilitative mental health and alcohol and drug abuse services including home and community-based preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and palliative interventions rendered to individuals in an individual or group setting by a mental health or alcohol and drug abuse professional in accordance with a plan of treatment appropriately established, implemented, monitored, and revised under the auspices of a therapeutic team as a part of client services management. As used in this section, mental health professional and alcohol and drug abuse professional shall be defined by the department of mental health pursuant to duly promulgated rules. With respect to services established by this subdivision, the department of social services, MO HealthNet division, shall enter into an agreement with the department of mental health. Matching funds for outpatient mental health services, clinic mental health services, and rehabilitation services for mental health and alcohol and drug abuse shall be certified by the department of mental health to the MO HealthNet division. The agreement shall establish a mechanism for the joint implementation of the provisions of this subdivision. In addition, the agreement shall establish a mechanism by which rates for services may be jointly developed;\n\n(17) Such additional services as defined by the MO HealthNet division to be furnished under waivers of federal statutory requirements as provided for and authorized by the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 301, et seq.) subject to appropriation by the general assembly;\n\n(18) The services of an advanced practice registered nurse with a collaborative practice agreement to the extent that such services are provided in accordance with chapters 334 and 335, and regulations promulgated thereunder;\n\n(19) Nursing home costs for participants receiving benefit payments under subdivision (4) of this subsection to reserve a bed for the participant in the nursing home during the time that the participant is absent due to admission to a hospital for services which cannot be performed on an outpatient basis, subject to the provisions of this subdivision:\n\n(a) The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only if:\n\na. The occupancy rate of the nursing home is at or above ninety-seven percent of MO HealthNet certified licensed beds, according to the most recent quarterly census provided to the department of health and senior services which was taken prior to when the participant is admitted to the hospital; and\n\nb. The patient is admitted to a hospital for a medical condition with an anticipated stay of three days or less;\n\n(b) The payment to be made under this subdivision shall be provided for a maximum of three days per hospital stay;\n\n(c) For each day that nursing home costs are paid on behalf of a participant under this subdivision during any period of six consecutive months such participant shall, during the same period of six consecutive months, be ineligible for payment of nursing home costs of two otherwise available temporary leave of absence days provided under subdivision (5) of this subsection; and\n\n(d) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply unless the nursing home receives notice from the participant or the participant's responsible party that the participant intends to return to the nursing home following the hospital stay. If the nursing home receives such notification and all other provisions of this subsection have been satisfied, the nursing home shall provide notice to the participant or the participant's responsible party prior to release of the reserved bed;\n\n(20) Prescribed medically necessary durable medical equipment. An electronic web-based prior authorization system using best medical evidence and care and treatment guidelines consistent with national standards shall be used to verify medical need;\n\n(21) Hospice care. As used in this subdivision, the term\"hospice care\"means a coordinated program of active professional medical attention within a home, outpatient and inpatient care which treats the terminally ill patient and family as a unit, employing a medically directed interdisciplinary team. The program provides relief of severe pain or other physical symptoms and supportive care to meet the special needs arising out of physical, psychological, spiritual, social, and economic stresses which are experienced during the final stages of illness, and during dying and bereavement and meets the Medicare requirements for participation as a hospice as are provided in 42 CFR Part 418. The rate of reimbursement paid by the MO HealthNet division to the hospice provider for room and board furnished by a nursing home to an eligible hospice patient shall not be less than ninety-five percent of the rate of reimbursement which would have been paid for facility services in that nursing home facility for that patient, in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 6408 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989);\n\n(22) Prescribed medically necessary dental services.

The MO HealthNet division shall, by July 1, 2008, provide to the general assembly a four-year plan to achieve parity with Medicare reimbursement rates and for third-party payor average dental reimbursement rates. Such plan shall be subject to appropriation and the division shall include in its annual budget request to the governor the necessary funding needed to complete the four-year plan developed under this subdivision.\n\n2.

As used in this subdivision, the term\"hospice care\"means a coordinated program of active professional medical attention within a home, outpatient and inpatient care which treats the terminally ill patient and family as a unit, employing a medically directed interdisciplinary team. The program provides relief of severe pain or other physical symptoms and supportive care to meet the special needs arising out of physical, psychological, spiritual, social, and economic stresses which are experienced during the final stages of illness, and during dying and bereavement and meets the Medicare requirements for participation as a hospice as are provided in 42 CFR Part 418. The rate of reimbursement paid by the MO HealthNet division to the hospice provider for room and board furnished by a nursing home to an eligible hospice patient shall not be less than ninety-five percent of the rate of reimbursement which would have been paid for facility services in that nursing home facility for that patient, in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 6408 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989);\n\n(6) Comprehensive day rehabilitation services beginning early posttrauma as part of a coordinated system of care for individuals with disabling impairments. Rehabilitation services must be based on an individualized, goal-oriented, comprehensive and coordinated treatment plan developed, implemented, and monitored through an interdisciplinary assessment designed to restore an individual to optimal level of physical, cognitive, and behavioral function. The MO HealthNet division shall establish by administrative rule the definition and criteria for designation of a comprehensive day rehabilitation service facility, benefit limitations and payment mechanism. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this subdivision shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2005, shall be invalid and void.\n\n3. The MO HealthNet division may require any participant receiving MO HealthNet benefits to pay part of the charge or cost until July 1, 2008, and an additional payment after July 1, 2008, as defined by rule duly promulgated by the MO HealthNet division, for all covered services except for those services covered under subdivisions (15) and (16) of subsection 1 of this section and sections 208.631 to 208.657 to the extent and in the manner authorized by Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq.) and regulations thereunder. When substitution of a generic drug is permitted by the prescriber according to section 338.056, and a generic drug is substituted for a name-brand drug, the MO HealthNet division may not lower or delete the requirement to make a co-payment pursuant to regulations of Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. A provider of goods or services described under this section must collect from all participants the additional payment that may be required by the MO HealthNet division under authority granted herein, if the division exercises that authority, to remain eligible as a provider. Any payments made by participants under this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of payments made by the state for goods or services described herein except the participant portion of the pharmacy professional dispensing fee shall be in addition to and not in lieu of payments to pharmacists. A provider may collect the co-payment at the time a service is provided or at a later date. A provider shall not refuse to provide a service if a participant is unable to pay a required payment. If it is the routine business practice of a provider to terminate future services to an individual with an unclaimed debt, the provider may include uncollected co-payments under this practice. Providers who elect not to undertake the provision of services based on a history of bad debt shall give participants advance notice and a reasonable opportunity for payment. A provider, representative, employee, independent contractor, or agent of a pharmaceutical manufacturer shall not make co-payment for a participant. This subsection shall not apply to other qualified children, pregnant women, or blind persons. If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not approve the MO HealthNet state plan amendment submitted by the department of social services that would allow a provider to deny future services to an individual with uncollected co-payments, the denial of services shall not be allowed. The department of social services shall inform providers regarding the acceptability of denying services as the result of unpaid co-payments.\n\n4. The MO HealthNet division shall have the right to collect medication samples from participants in order to maintain program integrity.\n\n5. Reimbursement for obstetrical and pediatric services under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this section shall be timely and sufficient to enlist enough health care providers so that care and services are available under the state plan for MO HealthNet benefits at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area, as required under subparagraph (a)(30)(A) of 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n6. Beginning July 1, 1990, reimbursement for services rendered in federally funded health centers shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsection 6402(c) and Section 6404 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989) and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n7. Beginning July 1, 1990, the department of social services shall provide notification and referral of children below age five, and pregnant, breast-feeding, or postpartum women who are determined to be eligible for MO HealthNet benefits under section 208.151 to the special supplemental food programs for women, infants and children administered by the department of health and senior services. Such notification and referral shall conform to the requirements of Section 6406 of P.L. 101-239 and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n8. Providers of long-term care services shall be reimbursed for their costs in accordance with the provisions of Section 1902 (a)(13)(A) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n9. Reimbursement rates to long-term care providers with respect to a total change in ownership, at arm's length, for any facility previously licensed and certified for participation in the MO HealthNet program shall not increase payments in excess of the increase that would result from the application of Section 1902 (a)(13)(C) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a (a)(13)(C).\n\n10. The MO HealthNet division may enroll qualified residential care facilities and assisted living facilities, as defined in chapter 198, as MO HealthNet personal care providers.\n\n11. Any income earned by individuals eligible for certified extended employment at a sheltered workshop under chapter 178 shall not be considered as income for purposes of determining eligibility under this section.\n\n12. If the Missouri Medicaid audit and compliance unit changes any interpretation or application of the requirements for reimbursement for MO HealthNet services from the interpretation or application that has been applied previously by the state in any audit of a MO HealthNet provider, the Missouri Medicaid audit and compliance unit shall notify all affected MO HealthNet providers five business days before such change shall take effect. Failure of the Missouri Medicaid audit and compliance unit to notify a provider of such change shall entitle the provider to continue to receive and retain reimbursement until such notification is provided and shall waive any liability of such provider for recoupment or other loss of any payments previously made prior to the five business days after such notice has been sent. Each provider shall provide the Missouri Medicaid audit and compliance unit a valid email address and shall agree to receive communications electronically. The notification required under this section shall be delivered in writing by the United States Postal Service or electronic mail to each provider.\n\n13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate or limit the department's statutory requirement to promulgate rules under chapter 536.\n\n14. Beginning July 1, 2016, and subject to appropriations, providers of behavioral, social, and psychophysiological services for the prevention, treatment, or management of physical health problems shall be reimbursed utilizing the behavior assessment and intervention reimbursement codes 96150 to 96154 or their successor codes under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding system. Providers eligible for such reimbursement shall include psychologists.\n\n15. There shall be no payments made under this section for gender transition surgeries, cross-sex hormones, or puberty-blocking drugs, as such terms are defined in section 191.1720, for the purpose of a gender transition.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 325, A.L. 1969 p. 337, A.L. 1971 H.B. 17, A.L. 1972 H.B. 673, H.B. 1254, A.L. 1973 S.B. 302, A.L. 1975 H.B. 974, A.L. 1977 S.B. 334, A.L. 1978 S.B. 492, S.B. 671, A.L. 1978 S.B. 505 §§ 1, 2, 3, A.L. 1981 S.B. 63, H.B. 901, A.L. 1986 S.B. 463 & 629, A.L. 1988 H.B. 1139, A.L. 1990 S.B. 524 merged with S.B. 765, A.L. 1992 H.B. 899 merged with S.B. 573 & 634 merged with S.B. 721, A.L. 1993 H.B. 564, A.L. 2004 S.B. 1003, A.L. 2005 S.B. 539, A.L. 2007 S.B. 577, A.L. 2011 H.B. 552, A.L. 2013 S.B. 127, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision, A.L. 2015 S.B. 210, A.L. 2016 S.B. 607 merged with S.B. 608, A.L. 2018 H.B. 1516, A.L. 2021 1st Ex.

MO HealthNet shall include benefit payments for Medicare Part A cost sharing as defined in clause (p)(3)(A)(i) of 42 U.S.C. 1396d on behalf of qualified disabled and working individuals as defined in subsection (s) of Section 42 U.S.C. 1396d as required by subsection (d) of Section 6408 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989). The MO HealthNet division may impose a premium for such benefit payments as authorized by paragraph (d)(3) of Section 6408 of P.L. 101-239.\n\n4. MO HealthNet shall include benefit payments for Medicare Part B cost sharing described in 42 U.S.C. Section 1396(d)(p)(3)(A)(ii) for individuals described in subsection 2 of this section, but for the fact that their income exceeds the income level established by the state under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396(d)(p)(2) but is less than one hundred and ten percent beginning January 1, 1993, and less than one hundred and twenty percent beginning January 1, 1995, of the official poverty line for a family of the size involved.\n\n5.

Enrollment in a group health plan must be cost effective, as established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, before enrollment in the group health plan is required. If all members of a family are not eligible for MO HealthNet and enrollment of the Title XIX eligible members in a group health plan is not possible unless all family members are enrolled, all premiums for noneligible members shall be treated as payment for MO HealthNet of eligible family members. Payment for noneligible family members must be cost effective, taking into account payment of all such premiums. Non-Title XIX eligible family members shall pay all deductible, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations. Each individual as a condition of eligibility for MO HealthNet benefits shall apply for enrollment in the group health plan.\n\n6. Any Social Security cost-of-living increase at the beginning of any year shall be disregarded until the federal poverty level for such year is implemented.\n\n7. If a MO HealthNet participant has paid the requested spenddown in cash for any month and subsequently pays an out-of-pocket valid medical expense for such month, such expense shall be allowed as a deduction to future required spenddown for up to three months from the date of such expense.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 325, A.L. 1967 1st Ex.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to sections 208.152, 208.153, 208.159 and 208.162:\n\n*(1) There shall be no revisions to a facility's reimbursement rate for providing nursing care services under this chapter upon a change in ownership, management control, operation, stock, leasehold interests by whatever form for any facility previously licensed or certified for participation in the Medicaid program. Increased costs for the successor owner, management or leaseholder that result from such a change shall not be recognized for purposes of reimbursement;\n\n*(2) In the case of a newly built facility or part thereof which is less than two years of age and enters the Title XIX program under this chapter after July 1, 1983, a reimbursement rate shall be assigned based on the lesser of projected estimated operating costs or one hundred ten percent of the median rate for the facility's class to include urban and rural categories for each level of care including ICF only and SNF/ICF. The rates set under this provision shall be effective for a period of twelve months from the effective date of the provider agreement at which time the rate for the future year shall be set in accordance with reported costs of the facility recognized under the reimbursement plan and as provided in subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection.

Actual acquisition costs, which is the original cost to construct or acquire the building, not to exceed the costs as determined in section 197.357; or\n\nb. Reasonable construction or acquisition cost computed by applying the regional Dodge Construction Index for 1981 with a trend factor, if necessary, or another current construction cost measure multiplied by one hundred eight percent as an allowance for fees authorized as architectural or legal not included in the Dodge Index Value, multiplied by the square footage of the facility not to exceed three hundred twenty-five square feet per bed, multiplied by the ratio of forty minus the actual years of the age of the facility divided by forty; and multiplied by a return rate of twelve percent; and divided by ninety-three percent of the facility's total available beds times three hundred sixty-five days.\n\n(b) The maximum movable equipment rate will be fifty-three cents per bed day.\n\n(c) The maximum allowable land area is defined as five acres for a facility with one hundred or less beds and one additional acre for each additional one hundred beds or fraction thereof for a facility with one hundred one or more beds.\n\n(d) The land rate will be calculated as:\n\na. For facilities with land areas at or below the maximum allowable land area, multiply the acquisition cost of the land by the return rate of twelve percent, divide by ninety-three percent of the facility's total available beds times three hundred sixty-five days.\n\nb. For facilities with land areas greater than the maximum allowable land area, divide the acquisition cost of the land by the total acres, multiply by the maximum allowable land area, multiply by the return rate of twelve percent, divide by ninety-three percent of the facility's total available beds times three hundred sixty-five days.\n\n(e) The maximum working capital rate will be twenty cents per day;\n\n*(4) If a provider does not provide the actual acquisition cost to determine a reimbursement rate under subparagraph a. of paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, the sum of the building and building equipment rate, movable equipment rate, land rate, and working capital rate shall be set at a reimbursement rate of six dollars;\n\n(5) For each state fiscal year a negotiated trend factor shall be applied to each facility's Title XIX per diem reimbursement rate.

A participant who has notice or who has actual knowledge of the department's rights to third-party benefits who receives any third-party benefit or proceeds for a covered illness or injury is either required to pay the division within sixty days after receipt of settlement proceeds the full amount of the third-party benefits up to the total MO HealthNet benefits provided or to place the full amount of the third-party benefits in a trust account for the benefit of the division pending judicial or administrative determination of the division's right to third-party benefits.\n\n5. Every person, corporation or partnership who acts for or on behalf of a person who is or was eligible for MO HealthNet benefits under sections 208.151 to 208.159 and sections 208.162*and 208.204 for purposes of pursuing the applicant's or participant's claim which accrued as a result of a nonoccupational or nonwork-related incident or occurrence resulting in the payment of MO HealthNet benefits shall notify the MO HealthNet division upon agreeing to assist such person and further shall notify the MO HealthNet division of any institution of a proceeding, settlement or the results of the pursuit of the claim and give thirty days' notice before any judgment, award, or settlement may be satisfied in any action or any claim by the applicant or participant to recover damages for such injuries, disease, or disability, or benefits arising from a health insurance program to which the participant may be entitled.\n\n6. Every participant, minor, guardian, conservator, personal representative, estate, including persons entitled under section 537.080 to bring an action for wrongful death, or his attorney or legal representative shall promptly notify the MO HealthNet division of any recovery from a third party and shall immediately reimburse the department of social services, MO HealthNet division, or its contractor from the proceeds of any settlement, judgment, or other recovery in any action or claim initiated against any such third party. A judgment, award, or settlement in an action by a participant to recover damages for injuries or other third-party benefits in which the division has an interest may not be satisfied without first giving the division notice and a reasonable opportunity to file and satisfy the claim or proceed with any action as otherwise permitted by law.\n\n7. The department of social services, MO HealthNet division or its contractor shall have a right to recover the amount of payments made to a provider under this chapter because of an injury, disease, or disability, or benefits arising from a health insurance plan to which the participant may be entitled for which a third party is or may be liable in contract, tort or otherwise under law or equity. Upon request by the MO HealthNet division, all third-party payers shall provide the MO HealthNet division with information contained in a 270/271 Health Care Eligibility Benefits Inquiry and Response standard transaction mandated under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, except that third-party payers shall not include accident-only, specified disease, disability income, hospital indemnity, or other fixed indemnity insurance policies.\n\n8. The department of social services or MO HealthNet division shall have a lien upon any moneys to be paid by any insurance company or similar business enterprise, person, corporation, institution, public agency or private agency in settlement or satisfaction of a judgment on any claim for injuries or disability or disease benefits arising from a health insurance program to which the participant may be entitled which resulted in medical expenses for which the department or MO HealthNet division made payment. This lien shall also be applicable to any moneys which may come into the possession of any attorney who is handling the claim for injuries, or disability or disease or benefits arising from a health insurance plan to which the participant may be entitled which resulted in payments made by the department or MO HealthNet division. In each case, a lien notice shall be served by certified mail or registered mail, upon the party or parties against whom the applicant or participant has a claim, demand or cause of action. The lien shall claim the charge and describe the interest the department or MO HealthNet division has in the claim, demand or cause of action. The lien shall attach to any verdict or judgment entered and to any money or property which may be recovered on account of such claim, demand, cause of action or suit from and after the time of the service of the notice.\n\n9. On petition filed by the department, or by the participant, or by the defendant, the court, on written notice of all interested parties, may adjudicate the rights of the parties and enforce the charge. The court may approve the settlement of any claim, demand or cause of action either before or after a verdict, and nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the actual trial or final adjudication of any claim, demand or cause of action upon which the department has charge. The court may determine what portion of the recovery shall be paid to the department against the recovery. In making this determination the court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing and shall consider competent evidence pertaining to the following matters:\n\n(1) The amount of the charge sought to be enforced against the recovery when expressed as a percentage of the gross amount of the recovery; the amount of the charge sought to be enforced against the recovery when expressed as a percentage of the amount obtained by subtracting from the gross amount of the recovery the total attorney's fees and other costs incurred by the participant incident to the recovery; and whether the department should, as a matter of fairness and equity, bear its proportionate share of the fees and costs incurred to generate the recovery from which the charge is sought to be satisfied;\n\n(2) The amount, if any, of the attorney's fees and other costs incurred by the participant incident to the recovery and paid by the participant up to the time of recovery, and the amount of such fees and costs remaining unpaid at the time of recovery;\n\n(3) The total hospital, doctor and other medical expenses incurred for care and treatment of the injury to the date of recovery therefor, the portion of such expenses theretofore paid by the participant, by insurance provided by the participant, and by the department, and the amount of such previously incurred expenses which remain unpaid at the time of recovery and by whom such incurred, unpaid expenses are to be paid;\n\n(4) Whether the recovery represents less than substantially full recompense for the injury and the hospital, doctor and other medical expenses incurred to the date of recovery for the care and treatment of the injury, so that reduction of the charge sought to be enforced against the recovery would not likely result in a double recovery or unjust enrichment to the participant;\n\n(5) The age of the participant and of persons dependent for support upon the participant, the nature and permanency of the participant's injuries as they affect not only the future employability and education of the participant but also the reasonably necessary and foreseeable future material, maintenance, medical rehabilitative and training needs of the participant, the cost of such reasonably necessary and foreseeable future needs, and the resources available to meet such needs and pay such costs;\n\n(6) The realistic ability of the participant to repay in whole or in part the charge sought to be enforced against the recovery when judged in light of the factors enumerated above.\n\n10. The burden of producing evidence sufficient to support the exercise by the court of its discretion to reduce the amount of a proven charge sought to be enforced against the recovery shall rest with the party seeking such reduction. The computerized records of the MO HealthNet division, certified by the director or his or her designee, shall be prima facie evidence of proof of moneys expended and the amount of the debt due the state.\n\n11. The court may reduce and apportion the department's or MO HealthNet division's lien proportionate to the recovery of the claimant. The court may consider the nature and extent of the injury, economic and noneconomic loss, settlement offers, comparative negligence as it applies to the case at hand, hospital costs, physician costs, and all other appropriate costs. The department or MO HealthNet division shall pay its pro rata share of the attorney's fees based on the department's or MO HealthNet division's lien as it compares to the total settlement agreed upon. This section shall not affect the priority of an attorney's lien under section 484.140. The charges of the department or MO HealthNet division or contractor described in this section, however, shall take priority over all other liens and charges existing under the laws of the state of Missouri with the exception of the attorney's lien under such statute.\n\n12. Whenever the department of social services or MO HealthNet division has a statutory charge under this section against a recovery for damages incurred by a participant because of its advancement of any assistance, such charge shall not be satisfied out of any recovery until the attorney's claim for fees is satisfied, regardless of whether an action based on participant's claim has been filed in court. Nothing herein shall prohibit the director from entering into a compromise agreement with any participant, after consideration of the factors in subsections 9 to 13 of this section.\n\n13. This section shall be inapplicable to any claim, demand or cause of action arising under the workers' compensation act, chapter 287. From funds recovered pursuant to this section the federal government shall be paid a portion thereof equal to the proportionate part originally provided by the federal government to pay for MO HealthNet benefits to the participant or minor involved. The department or MO HealthNet division shall enforce TEFRA liens, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p, as authorized by federal law and regulation on permanently institutionalized individuals. The department or MO HealthNet division shall have the right to enforce TEFRA liens, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396p, as authorized by federal law and regulation on all other institutionalized individuals. For the purposes of this subsection,\"permanently institutionalized individuals\"includes those people who the department or MO HealthNet division determines cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and return home, and\"property\"includes the homestead and all other personal and real property in which the participant has sole legal interest or a legal interest based upon co-ownership of the property which is the result of a transfer of property for less than the fair market value within thirty months prior to the participant's entering the nursing facility. The following provisions shall apply to such liens:\n\n(1) The lien shall be for the debt due the state for MO HealthNet benefits paid or to be paid on behalf of a participant. The amount of the lien shall be for the full amount due the state at the time the lien is enforced;\n\n(2) The MO HealthNet division shall file for record, with the recorder of deeds of the county in which any real property of the participant is situated, a written notice of the lien. The notice of lien shall contain the name of the participant and a description of the real estate. The recorder shall note the time of receiving such notice, and shall record and index the notice of lien in the same manner as deeds of real estate are required to be recorded and indexed. The director or the director's designee may release or discharge all or part of the lien and notice of the release shall also be filed with the recorder. The department of social services, MO HealthNet division, shall provide payment to the recorder of deeds the fees set for similar filings in connection with the filing of a lien and any other necessary documents;\n\n(3) No such lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to the individual's death on account of MO HealthNet benefits paid except:\n\n(a) In the case of the real property of an individual:\n\na. Who is an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for the intellectually disabled, or other medical institution, if such individual is required, as a condition of receiving services in such institution, to spend for costs of medical care all but a minimal amount of his or her income required for personal needs; and\n\nb. With respect to whom the director of the MO HealthNet division or the director's designee determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that he cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged from the medical institution and to return home. The hearing, if requested, shall proceed under the provisions of chapter 536 before a hearing officer designated by the director of the MO HealthNet division; or\n\n(b) Pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual;\n\n(4) No lien may be imposed under paragraph (b) of subdivision (3) of this subsection on such individual's home if one or more of the following persons is lawfully residing in such home:\n\n(a) The spouse of such individual;\n\n(b) Such individual's child who is under twenty-one years of age, or is blind or permanently and totally disabled; or\n\n(c) A sibling of such individual who has an equity interest in such home and who was residing in such individual's home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date of the individual's admission to the medical institution;\n\n(5) Any lien imposed with respect to an individual pursuant to subparagraph b. of paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of this subsection shall dissolve upon that individual's discharge from the medical institution and return home.\n\n14. The debt due the state provided by this section is subordinate to the lien provided by section 484.130 or section 484.140, relating to an attorney's lien and to the participant's expenses of the claim against the third party.\n\n15. Application for and acceptance of MO HealthNet benefits under this chapter shall constitute an assignment to the department of social services or MO HealthNet division of any rights to support for the purpose of medical care as determined by a court or administrative order and of any other rights to payment for medical care.\n\n16. All participants receiving benefits as defined in this chapter shall cooperate with the state by reporting to the family support division or the MO HealthNet division, within thirty days, any occurrences where an injury to their persons or to a member of a household who receives MO HealthNet benefits is sustained, on such form or forms as provided by the family support division or MO HealthNet division.\n\n17. If a person fails to comply with the provision of any judicial or administrative decree or temporary order requiring that person to maintain medical insurance on or be responsible for medical expenses for a dependent child, spouse, or ex-spouse, in addition to other remedies available, that person shall be liable to the state for the entire cost of the medical care provided pursuant to eligibility under any public assistance program on behalf of that dependent child, spouse, or ex-spouse during the period for which the required medical care was provided. Where a duty of support exists and no judicial or administrative decree or temporary order for support has been entered, the person owing the duty of support shall be liable to the state for the entire cost of the medical care provided on behalf of the dependent child or spouse to whom the duty of support is owed.\n\n18. The department director or the director's designee may compromise, settle or waive any such claim in whole or in part in the interest of the MO HealthNet program. Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, the department of social services, MO HealthNet division is not required to seek reimbursement from a liable third party on claims for which the amount it reasonably expects to recover will be less than the cost of recovery or for which recovery efforts will not be cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is determined based on the following:\n\n(1) Actual and legal issues of liability as may exist between the participant and the liable party;\n\n(2) Total funds available for settlement; and\n\n(3) An estimate of the cost to the division of pursuing its claim.\n\n(L. 1981 H.B. 901 § 1, A.L. 1982 H.B. 1086, A.L. 1987 H.B. 518, A.L. 1990 S.B. 765, A.L. 1993 H.B. 564, A.L. 1996 S.B. 869, A.L. 2005 S.B. 539, A.L. 2007 S.B. 577, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1868 merged with H.B. 2226, et al. merged with S.B. 583 merged with S.B. 842, et al. merged with S.B. 1007, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1064)\n\n*Section 208.162 was repealed by S.B. 539, 2005.\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nDivision of medical services has right to payment from insurers or other obligated parties for health care services, 376.819\n\n(1998) The amended statute is remedial and may be applied retroactively and is more specific than section 473.398 where it conflicts.

The department shall, subject to appropriation, enroll in self-sufficiency pacts by July 1, 1996, the following AFDC households:\n\n(1) Not fewer than fifteen percent of AFDC households who are required to participate in the FUTURES program under sections 208.405 and 208.410, and who are currently participating in the FUTURES program;\n\n(2) Not fewer than five percent of AFDC households who are required to participate in the FUTURES program under sections 208.405 and 208.410, but who are currently not participating in the FUTURES program; and\n\n(3) By October 1, 1997, not fewer than twenty-five percent of aid to families with dependent children recipients, excluding recipients who meet the following criteria and are exempt from mandatory participation in the family self-sufficiency program:\n\n(a) Disabled individuals who meet the criteria for coverage under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, P.L. 101-336, and are assessed as lacking the capacity to engage in full-time or part-time subsidized employment;\n\n(b) Parents who are exclusively responsible for the full-time care of disabled children; and\n\n(c) Other families excluded from mandatory participation in FUTURES by federal guidelines.\n\n3. Upon enrollment in the family self-sufficiency program, a household shall receive an initial assessment of the family's educational, child care, employment, medical and other supportive needs. There shall also be assessment of the recipient's skills, education and work experience and a review of other relevant circumstances. Each assessment shall be completed in consultation with the recipient and, if appropriate, each child whose needs are being assessed.\n\n4. Family assessments shall be used to complete a family self-sufficiency pact in negotiation with the family. The family self-sufficiency pact shall identify a specific point in time, no longer than twenty-four months after the family enrolls in the self-sufficiency pact, when the family's primary self-sufficiency pact shall conclude. The self-sufficiency pact is subject to reassessment and may be extended for up to an additional twenty-four months, but the maximum term of any self-sufficiency pact shall not exceed a total of forty-eight months. Family self-sufficiency pacts should be completed and entered into within three months of the initial assessment.\n\n5. The family support division shall complete family self-sufficiency pact assessments and/or may contract with other agencies for this purpose, subject to appropriation.\n\n6. Family self-sufficiency assessments shall be used to develop a family self-sufficiency pact after a meeting. The meeting participants shall include:\n\n(1) A representative of the family support division, who may be a case manager or other specially designated, trained and qualified person authorized to negotiate the family self-sufficiency pact and follow-up with the family and responsible state agencies to ensure that the self-sufficiency pact is reviewed at least annually and, if necessary, revised as further assessments, experience, circumstances and resources require;\n\n(2) The recipient and, if appropriate, another family member, assessment personnel or an individual interested in the family's welfare.\n\n7. The family self-sufficiency pact shall:\n\n(1) Be in writing and establish mutual state and family member obligations as part of a plan containing goals, objectives and timelines tailored to the needs of the family and leading to self-sufficiency;\n\n(2) Identify available support services such as subsidized child care, medical services and transportation benefits during a transition period, to help ensure that the family will be less likely to return to public assistance.\n\n8. The family self-sufficiency pact shall include a parent and child development plan to develop the skills and knowledge of adults in their role as parents to their children and partners of their spouses. Such plan shall include school participation records. The department of social services shall, in cooperation with the department of health and senior services, the department of mental health, and the \"Parents as Teachers\" program in the department of elementary and secondary education, develop or make available existing programs to be presented to persons enrolled in a family self-sufficiency pact.\n\n9. A family enrolled in a family self-sufficiency pact may own or possess property as described in subdivision (6) of subsection 2 of section 208.010 with a value of five thousand dollars instead of the one thousand dollars as set forth in subdivision (6) of subsection 2 of section 208.010.\n\n10. A family receiving AFDC may own one automobile, which shall not be subject to property value limitations provided in section 208.010.\n\n11. Subject to appropriations and necessary waivers, the department of social services may disregard from one-half to two-thirds of a recipient's gross earned income for job-related and other expenses necessary for a family to make the transition to self-sufficiency.\n\n12. A recipient may request a review by the director of the family support division, or the director's designee, of the family self-sufficiency pact or any of its provisions that the recipient objects to because it is inappropriate. After receiving an informal review, a recipient who is still aggrieved may appeal the results of that review under the procedures in section 208.080.\n\n13. The term of the family self-sufficiency pact may only be extended due to circumstances creating barriers to self-sufficiency and the family self-sufficiency pact may be updated and adjusted to identify and address the removal of these barriers to self-sufficiency.\n\n14. Where the capacity of services does not meet the demand for the services, limited services may be substituted and the pact completion date extended until the necessary services become available for the participant. The pact shall be modified appropriately if the services are not delivered as a result of waiting lists or other delays.\n\n15. The family support division shall establish a training program for self-sufficiency pact case managers which shall include but not be limited to:\n\n(1) Knowledge of public and private programs available to assist recipients to achieve self-sufficiency;\n\n(2) Skills in facilitating recipient access to public and private programs; and\n\n(3) Skills in motivating and in observing, listening and communicating.\n\n16. The family support division shall ensure that families enrolled in the family self-sufficiency program make full use of the federal earned income tax credit.\n\n17. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of a self-sufficiency pact developed pursuant to this section shall result in a recalculation of the AFDC cash grant for the household without considering the needs of the caretaker recipient.\n\n18. If a suspension of caretaker benefits is imposed, the recipient shall have the right to a review by the director of the family support division or the director's designee.\n\n19. After completing the family self-sufficiency program, should a recipient who has previously received thirty-six months of aid to families with dependent children benefits again become eligible for aid to families with dependent children benefits, the cash grant amount shall be calculated without considering the needs of caretaker recipients. The limitations of this subsection shall not apply to any applicant who starts a self-sufficiency pact on or before July 1, 1997, or to any applicant who has become disabled or is receiving or has received unemployment benefits since completion of a self-sufficiency program.\n\n20. There shall be conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the family self-sufficiency program contained in the provisions of this act and the job opportunities and basic skills training program (\"JOBS\" or \"FUTURES\" ) as authorized by the provisions of sections 208.400 to 208.425. The evaluation shall be conducted by a competitively chosen independent and impartial contractor selected by the commissioner of the office of administration. The evaluation shall be based on specific, measurable data relating to those who participate successfully and unsuccessfully in these programs and a control group, factors which contributed to such success or failures, the structure of such programs and other areas. The evaluation shall include recommendations on whether such programs should be continued and suggested improvements in such programs. The first such evaluation shall be completed and reported to the governor and the general assembly by September 1, 1997. Future evaluations shall be completed every three years thereafter. In addition, in 1997, and every three years thereafter, the oversight division of the committee on legislative research shall complete an evaluation on general relief, child care and development block grants and social services block grants.\n\n21. The director of the department of social services may promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to section 660.017, and chapter 536 governing the use of family self-sufficiency pacts in this program and in other programs, including programs for noncustodial parents of children receiving assistance.\n\n22. The director of the department of social services shall apply to the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services for all waivers of requirements under federal law necessary to implement the provisions of this section with full federal participation. The provisions of this section shall be implemented, subject to appropriation, as waivers necessary to ensure continued federal participation are received.\n\n(L. 1994 H.B. 1547 & 961 § 1, A.L. 2014 H.B. 1299 Revision)",

In addition, the unborn child shall be in a family with income eligibility of no more than three hundred percent of the federal poverty level, or the equivalent modified adjusted gross income, unless the income eligibility is set lower by the general assembly through appropriations. In calculating family size as it relates to income eligibility, the family shall include, in addition to other family members, the unborn child, or in the case of a mother with a multiple pregnancy, all unborn children.\n\n3. Coverage for an unborn child enrolled in the show-me healthy babies program shall include all prenatal care and pregnancy-related services that benefit the health of the unborn child and that promote healthy labor, delivery, and birth. Coverage need not include services that are solely for the benefit of the pregnant mother, that are unrelated to maintaining or promoting a healthy pregnancy, and that provide no benefit to the unborn child. However, the department may include pregnancy-related assistance as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 1397ll.\n\n4.

Section 1397gg(e)(1)(J). The department shall seek any necessary state plan amendments or waivers to implement the provisions of this subdivision when the number of ineligible MO HealthNet participants removed from the program in 2023 pursuant to section 208.239 exceeds the projected number of beneficiaries likely to enroll in benefits in 2023 under this subdivision and subdivision (28) of subsection 1 of section 208.151, as determined by the department, by at least one hundred individuals.\n\n(b) The provisions of this subdivision shall remain in effect for any period of time during which the federal authority under 42 U.S.C.

The department shall provide information about the show-me healthy babies program to maternity homes as defined in section 135.600, pregnancy resource centers as defined in section 135.630, and other similar agencies and programs in the state that assist unborn children and their mothers. The department shall consider allowing such agencies and programs to assist in the enrollment of unborn children in the program, and in making determinations about presumptive eligibility and verification of the pregnancy.\n\n9. Within sixty days after August 28, 2014, the department shall submit a state plan amendment or seek any necessary waivers from the federal Department of Health and Human Services requesting approval for the show-me healthy babies program.\n\n10. At least annually, the department shall prepare and submit a report to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the president pro tempore of the senate analyzing and projecting the cost savings and benefits, if any, to the state, counties, local communities, school districts, law enforcement agencies, correctional centers, health care providers, employers, other public and private entities, and persons by enrolling unborn children in the show-me healthy babies program. The analysis and projection of cost savings and benefits, if any, may include but need not be limited to:\n\n(1) The higher federal matching rate for having an unborn child enrolled in the show-me healthy babies program versus the lower federal matching rate for a pregnant woman being enrolled in MO HealthNet or other federal programs;\n\n(2) The efficacy in providing services to unborn children through managed care organizations, group or individual health insurance providers or premium assistance, or through other nontraditional arrangements of providing health care;\n\n(3) The change in the proportion of unborn children who receive care in the first trimester of pregnancy due to a lack of waiting periods, by allowing presumptive eligibility, or by removal of other barriers, and any resulting or projected decrease in health problems and other problems for unborn children and women throughout pregnancy; at labor, delivery, and birth; and during infancy and childhood;\n\n(4) The change in healthy behaviors by pregnant women, such as the cessation of the use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, or other harmful practices, and any resulting or projected short-term and long-term decrease in birth defects; poor motor skills; vision, speech, and hearing problems; breathing and respiratory problems; feeding and digestive problems; and other physical, mental, educational, and behavioral problems; and\n\n(5) The change in infant and maternal mortality, preterm births and low birth weight babies and any resulting or projected decrease in short-term and long-term medical and other interventions.\n\n11. The show-me healthy babies program shall not be deemed an entitlement program, but instead shall be subject to a federal allotment or other federal appropriations and matching state appropriations.\n\n12. Nothing in this section shall be construed as obligating the state to continue the show-me healthy babies program if the allotment or payments from the federal government end or are not sufficient for the program to operate, or if the general assembly does not appropriate funds for the program.\n\n13. Nothing in this section shall be construed as expanding MO HealthNet or fulfilling a mandate imposed by the federal government on the state.\n\n(L. 2014 S.B. 716 merged with S.B. 754, A.L. 2023 S.B. 45 & 90 merged with S.B. 106)\n\nEffective 7-06-23",

There is hereby established a state pharmaceutical assistance program within the meaning of federal law at 42 U.S.C. Section 1395 w-133(b), to be known as the \"Missouri Rx Plan\". The purpose of the Missouri Rx plan, established within the department of social services, is to provide certain pharmaceutical benefits to certain elderly and disabled residents of this state, to facilitate coordination of benefits between the Missouri Rx plan and the federal Medicare Part D drug benefit program established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, P.L. 108-173, and as well as to enroll such individuals in said program.\n\n2. The Missouri Rx plan shall assist eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including individuals qualified as dual eligibles by virtue of their eligibility for receipt of benefits under both the Medicaid and Medicare programs, in defraying the cost of medically necessary prescription drugs through coordination with the Medicare Part D drug benefit program. The Missouri Rx plan may select one or more prescription drug plans, as approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as the preferred plan for purposes of the coordination of benefits between the Missouri Rx plan and the Medicare Part D drug. To ensure Medicare eligible seniors receive a coordinated benefit, the Missouri Rx plan may preliminarily enroll or reenroll beneficiaries of the Missouri Rx plan into a preferred prescription drug plan or plans in the absence of any action or application of the individual beneficiary seeking such enrollment, provided that each individual so enrolled shall be promptly informed of:\n\n(1) The procedures by which the individual may disenroll from the preferred PDP;\n\n(2) The existence of an alternative PDP or PDPs authorized to provide Medicare Part D benefits in the region in which the individual resides;\n\n(3) The manner by which the individual may change his or her enrollment to an alternative, nonpreferred PDP or obtain assistance in doing so; and\n\n(4)*Enrollment in a nonpreferred PDP will not adversely affect either the individual's eligibility for enrollment in the Missouri Rx plan or the amount of benefits the individual may be eligible to receive from the Missouri Rx plan. The enrollment authority under this section shall also include the authority to withdraw individuals from nonpreferred plans in order to maximize the benefit to the individual.\n\n3. The department shall promulgate rules and regulations, including benefit limits, as may be necessary to implement the Missouri Rx plan. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2005, shall be invalid and void.\n\n4. The department may delegate administrative responsibilities as necessary to implement the Missouri Rx plan. The department may designate or enter into contracts with other entities including but not limited to other states, governmental purchasing pools, or for-profit or nonprofit organizations to assist in the administration of the program.\n\n5. When requested by the department, other state agencies shall provide assistance or information necessary for the administration of the program.\n\n(L. 2005 S.B. 539)\n\nTerminates 8-28-29; see § 208.798\n\n*Word \"That\" appears in original rolls.",

Findings and purpose. —Findings and purposes.\n\nThe people of the state of Missouri find as follows:\n\n(1) Thousands of Missouri senior citizens and people with disabilities continue to live independently in their own homes and avoid placement in institutions such as nursing homes only as the result of the availability of qualified personal care attendants who assist them with the activities of daily living.\n\n(2) Many Missouri senior citizens and people with disabilities who could not otherwise afford personal care assistance services in their own homes receive the services with assistance provided by the state and federal governments under the Missouri consumer directed services program.\n\n(3) The United States Supreme Court has mandated that states provide services to persons with disabilities \"in community settings rather than in institutions\" when remaining in the community is appropriate, consistent with the wishes of the disabled person, and can be reasonably accommodated.\n\n(4) In-home care is not only the choice of most senior citizens and people with disabilities, it is less costly than institutional care such as that provided in nursing homes and thus saves Missouri taxpayers significant amounts of money.\n\n(5) The consumer directed services program permits the consumers of these highly intimate and personal services to hire, terminate and supervise the individual providing the services, but it does not currently give consumers any role in setting wage rates for personal care attendants.\n\n(6) Personal care attendants generally receive low wages, minimal or no benefits, little if any training, and have no meaningful input into their terms and conditions of employment and no meaningful means of making suggestions for improvements in the consumer directed services program.\n\n(7) The continued availability of quality home care services is threatened by a looming shortage of qualified personal care attendants due to the aging population in the state as well as low wages, a lack of benefits, and high rates of occupational injury. These poor working conditions also contribute to high turnover among personal care attendants that impairs the continuity of care.\n\n(8) The safety of home care services is threatened by both the failure of existing safeguards to protect consumers from potentially abusive attendants and lengthy delays in processing background checks as recently documented by the state auditor.\n\n(9) The continued availability of quality, safe home care services can be ensured through the creation of the \"Missouri Quality Home Care Council\" with authority to investigate the quality, safety and availability of home care services, recruit eligible personal care attendants, recommend qualifications for personal care attendants, improve the training of personal care attendants, establish a statewide list of eligible personal care attendants, refer consumers to eligible personal care attendants, engage in collective bargaining with a representative of personal care attendants, and recommend changes in personal care attendants' wages and benefits to the general assembly.\n\n(L. 2008 Adopted by Initiative, Proposition B, § 2, November 4, 2008)",

Development of the plans and enrollment into such plans shall begin July 1, 2008, and shall be completed by July 1, 2011, and shall take into account the appropriateness of enrolling particular participants into the specific plans and the time line for enrollment.

For purposes of this section,\"quality targets specified by the department\"shall include, but not be limited to, rates at which participants whose care is being managed by such plans seek to use hospital emergency department services for nonemergency medical conditions.\n\n2. Every participant shall be enrolled in a health improvement plan and be provided a health care home. All health improvement plans are required to help participants remain in the least restrictive level of care possible, use domestic-based call centers and nurse help lines, and report on participant and provider satisfaction information annually. All health improvement plans shall use best practices that are evidence-based. The department of social services shall evaluate and compare all health improvement plans on the basis of cost, quality, health improvement, health outcomes, social and behavioral outcomes, health status, customer satisfaction, use of evidence-based medicine, and use of best practices and shall report such findings to the oversight committee.\n\n3.

No provisions of any state law shall be construed as to require any aged, blind, or disabled person to enroll in a risk-bearing coordination plan.\n\n5. The department of social services shall, by July 1, 2008, commission an independent survey to assess health and wellness outcomes of MO HealthNet participants by examining key health care delivery system indicators, including but not limited to disease-specific outcome measures, provider network demographic statistics including but not limited to the number of providers per unit population broken down by specialty, subspecialty, and multidisciplinary providers by geographic areas of the state in comparison side-by-side with like indicators of providers available to the state-wide population, and participant and provider program satisfaction surveys. In counting the number of providers available, the study design shall use a definition of provider availability such that a provider that limits the number of MO HealthNet recipients seen in a unit of time is counted as a partial provider in the determination of availability. The department may contract with another organization in order to complete the survey, and shall give preference to Missouri-based organizations. The results of the study shall be completed within six months and be submitted to the general assembly, the governor, and the oversight committee.\n\n6. The department of social services shall engage in a public process for the design, development, and implementation of the health improvement plans and other aspects of MO HealthNet. Such public process shall allow for but not be limited to input from consumers, health advocates, disability advocates, providers, and other stakeholders.\n\n7. By July 1, 2008, all health improvement plans shall conduct a health risk assessment for enrolled participants and develop a plan of care for each enrolled participant with health status goals achievable through healthy lifestyles, and appropriate for the individual based on the participant's age and the results of the participant's health risk assessment.\n\n8. For any necessary contracts related to the purchase of products or services required to administer the MO HealthNet program, there shall be competitive requests for proposals consistent with state procurement policies of chapter 34 or through other existing state procurement processes specified in chapter 630.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 577)",
