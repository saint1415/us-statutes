State v. Randall (A.), 540 S.W.2d 156.\n\n(1987) Even though no money was exchanged before defendant was arrested for selling marijuana, instruction to jury on offense of selling marijuana was proper since acts of defendant constitute \"sale\" as defined by this section where defendant had made an agreement with undercover officers to deliver a set quantity for a set price and the defendant then delivered the marijuana to such officers.

      "text": "Title XII PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nChapter 195\n\n195.015. Authority to control. —1. The department of health and senior services shall administer this chapter and may add substances to the schedules after public notice and hearing. In making a determination regarding a substance, the department of health and senior services shall consider the following:\n\n(1) The actual or relative potential for abuse;\n\n(2) The scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;\n\n(3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance;\n\n(4) The history and current pattern of abuse;\n\n(5) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse;\n\n(6) The risk to the public health;\n\n(7) The potential of the substance to produce psychic or physiological dependence liability; and\n\n(8) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this chapter.\n\n2. After considering the factors enumerated in subsection 1 of this section the department of health and senior services shall make findings with respect thereto and issue a rule controlling the substance if it finds the substance has a potential for abuse.\n\n3. If the department of health and senior services designates a substance as an immediate precursor, substances which are precursors of the controlled precursor shall not be subject to control solely because they are precursors of the controlled precursor.\n\n4. If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a controlled substance under federal law and notice thereof is given to the department of health and senior services, the department of health and senior services shall similarly control the substance under this chapter and shall submit emergency rules to the secretary of state under section 536.025 within thirty days of publication in the federal register of a final order designating a substance as a controlled substance or rescheduling or deleting a substance, unless within that thirty-day period, the department of health and senior services objects to inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion. In that case, the department of health and senior services shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested parties an opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the department of health and senior services shall publish its decision, which shall be final unless altered by statute. Upon publication of objection to inclusion, rescheduling or deletion under this chapter by the department of health and senior services, control under this chapter is stayed as to the substance in question until the department of health and senior services publishes its decision. If the department promulgates emergency rules under this subsection, such rules may, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 7 of section 536.025, remain in effect until the general assembly concludes its next regular session following the imposition of any such rules. The department shall clearly state if the rules shall be in effect pursuant to this subsection or subsection 7 of section 536.025 in the emergency statement filed with the secretary of state.\n\n5. The department of health and senior services shall exclude any nonnarcotic substance from a schedule if such substance may, under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the law of this state, be lawfully sold over the counter without a prescription.\n\n6. The department of health and senior services shall prepare a list of all drugs falling within the purview of controlled substances. Upon preparation, a copy of the list shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state.\n\n(L. 1971 H.B. 69, A.L. 1989 S.B. 215 & 58, A.L. 2014 S.B. 491, A.L. 2020 H.B. 1896)\n\n(1975) Rescheduling of a controlled substance from schedule III to schedule II by division of health after same action on the federal level was proper and defendant's contention that the division had no authority to subtract or remove a substance was held invalid. State v. Winters (A.), 525 S.W.2d 417.\n\n(1982) Statute providing that if substance is designated as controlled substance under federal law and notice thereof is given to division of health, the division shall also control substance unless it objects and statute does not result in an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.

Upon a revocation order becoming final, all controlled substances may be forfeited to the state.\n\n10. The department of health and senior services may, upon review, terminate any restriction or limitation previously imposed upon a registration by the department of health and senior services if the registrant has remained in compliance with the imposed restrictions or limitations and local, state and federal laws since the time the restrictions or limitations were imposed.\n\n11. The department of health and senior services shall promptly notify the Drug Enforcement Administration, United States Department of Justice, or its successor agency, of all orders suspending or revoking registration and all forfeitures of controlled substances.\n\n12.

The notice shall contain a statement of the type of discipline proposed, the basis therefor, the date such action shall go into effect and a statement that the registrant shall have thirty days to request in writing a hearing before the administrative hearing commission. If no written request for a hearing is received by the department of health and senior services within thirty days of the applicant's or registrant's receipt of the notice, the proposed discipline shall take effect thirty-one days from the date the original notice was received by the applicant or registrant. If the registrant or applicant makes a written request for a hearing, the department of health and senior services shall file a complaint with the administrative hearing commission within sixty days of receipt of the written request for a hearing. The complaint shall comply with the laws and regulations for actions brought before the administrative hearing commission. The department of health and senior services may issue letters of censure or warning and may enter into agreements with a registrant or applicant which restrict or limit a registration without formal notice or hearing.\n\n13. The department of health and senior services may suspend any registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings under subsection 7 of this section if the department of health and senior services finds that there is imminent danger to the public health or safety which warrants this action.
