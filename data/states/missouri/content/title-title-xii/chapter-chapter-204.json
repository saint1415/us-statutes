Common sewer districts, where formed — establishment of common sewer subdistrict — submission of question of election by order of court — contents of order — approval, required percentage — notice of election, contents — ballot, form — circuit court may create subdistrict upon petition — petition, contents — boundaries of subdistrict, description by metes and bounds. —1. If the construction and maintenance of a common system of trunk sewers and sewage treatment plants is necessary to secure proper sanitary conditions for the preservation of public health in a natural drainage area the major portion of which lies within a county of the first class containing all or part of a city having a population of four hundred fifty thousand or more, or in a county of the first class not having a charter form of government, or in a county of the second, third or fourth class, and which natural drainage area contains all or portions of several drainage basins, several municipalities or sewer districts, and if a common sewer district encompassing the entire area would be eligible for federal aid and assistance under the provisions of Title 33, Section 1151 et seq. of the United States Code Annotated, as now or as may hereafter be amended, the area may be established and incorporated as a common sewer district under sections 204.250 to 204.470 in the following manner: The county commission, or in charter counties, the county executive with the concurrence by resolution of the county legislature, of the county within which the major portion of the area lies may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction over the major portion for the appointment of commissioners as herein provided, and to take further action as may be necessary for the submission to the legal voters residing in the area of the question whether the area shall be organized and incorporated as a common sewer district under sections 204.250 to 204.470.\n\n2. The petition shall set forth a description in general terms of the territory to be embraced in, suggest a name for the proposed common sewer district and state the aim and purposes for which the district is created.\n\n3. Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, if a sanitary sewage disposal or treatment system is necessary for any number of buildings used solely or primarily for residential or commercial purposes which are situated in such geographical proximity and manner to one another that the creation of a sewage disposal or treatment system is feasible, and such buildings are situated in or are in geographical proximity to an existing common sewer district formed pursuant to this chapter, and if sanitary sewage disposal or treatment services are not otherwise available for service to such buildings, regardless of whether the buildings lie in a natural drainage area or natural drainage basin, such area may be established as a common sewer subdistrict of an existing common sewer district formed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter by complying with the procedures set forth in subsections 4 to 7 of this section.\n\n4. The circuit court of the circuit proposing to create a sewer subdistrict pursuant to subsection 3 of this section may, by order of the court, for good cause shown, submit the question of creating such subdistrict to all owners of record of all real property within such proposed subdistrict at a general or special election called for that purpose. Such order shall set forth the project name for the proposed subdistrict, the general nature of the proposed subdistrict, the estimated cost of the sewer improvements for such subdistrict, the boundaries of the proposed subdistrict to be assessed for sewer improvements, and the proposed method or methods of assessment. The court may thereafter create a sewer subdistrict of an existing common sewer district formed pursuant to this chapter when the question of creating such subdistrict has been approved by the vote of the percentage of electors within such subdistrict voting thereon that is equal to the percentage of voter approval required for the issuance of general obligation bonds of the city or county wherein such subdistrict is located under Article VI, Section 26 of the Constitution of this State. The notice of election containing the question of creating a sewer subdistrict shall contain the project name for the proposed subdistrict, the general nature of the proposed subdistrict, the estimated cost of the sewer improvements for such subdistrict, the boundaries of the proposed subdistrict to be assessed for sewer improvements, the proposed method or methods of assessment, and a statement that the final cost of such sewer improvements assessed against property within the subdistrict and the amount of general obligation bonds issued therefor shall not exceed the estimated cost of such sewer improvements, as stated in such notice, by more than twenty-five percent. The ballot upon which the question of creating a sewer subdistrict is submitted to the qualified voters residing within the proposed subdistrict shall contain a question in substantially the following form:\n\nShall the ______ Circuit Court be authorized to create a sewer subdistrict proposed for the ______ (common sewer district name) and authorize the common sewer district to incur indebtedness and issue general obligation bonds to pay for all or part of the cost of the creation and maintenance of such subdistrict, the cost of all indebtedness so incurred to be assessed by the ______ (common sewer district name) on the property within the subdistrict?\n\n5. As an alternative to the procedure described in subsection 4 of this section, the circuit court of the circuit may create such a sewer subdistrict when a proper petition has been signed by the owners of record of at least two-thirds by area of all real property located within such proposed subdistrict. The petition, in order to become effective, shall be filed with the circuit court. A proper petition for the creation of a sewer subdistrict shall set forth the proposed subdistrict name, the general nature of the proposed subdistrict, the estimated cost of the sewer improvements for such subdistrict, the boundaries of the proposed subdistrict to be assessed for sewer improvements, the proposed method or methods of assessment, a notice that the names of the signers may not be withdrawn later than seven days after the petition is filed with the court, and a notice that the final cost of such assessments against property within the subdistrict and the amount of general obligation bonds issued therefor shall not exceed the estimated cost of sewer improvements, as stated in such petition, by more than twenty-five percent.\n\n6. Upon receiving the requisite voter approval at an election or upon the filing of a proper petition with the court, the court may by order determine the advisability of the subdistrict and may order that the subdistrict be established and that preliminary plans and specifications for the subdistrict be made. Such order shall state and make findings as to the subdistrict name, the nature of the subdistrict, the estimated cost of the sewer improvements for such subdistrict, the boundaries of the subdistrict to be assessed for sewer improvements, the proposed method or methods of assessment, and shall also state that the final cost of such assessments against the property within the subdistrict and the amount of general obligation bonds issued therefor shall not, without a new election or petition, exceed the estimated cost of such sewer improvements by more than twenty-five percent.\n\n7. The boundaries of the proposed subdistrict shall be described by metes and bounds, streets or other sufficiently specific description. The area of the subdistrict finally determined to be assessed may be less than, but shall not exceed, the total area comprising such district.\n\n(L. 1967 p. 310 § 6, A.L. 1972 H.B. 1239 & 1300, A.L. 1973 H.B. 625, A.L. 1992 H.B. 1803)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nCertain counties may assign operation of sewer district to common sewer district, which lies wholly or partially within county, procedure (Jackson, Cass, St. Louis and all first class noncharter counties), 249.451",

The principal and interest of such bonds shall be payable only from the revenues of the subdistrict and not from any revenues of the common sewer district as a whole;\n\n(4) To charge the costs of the common sewer district for operation and maintenance attributable to the subdistrict, plus a proportionate share of the common sewer district's costs of administration to revenues of the subdistrict and to consider such costs in determining reasonable charges to impose within the subdistrict under section 204.440;\n\n(5) With prior concurrence of the subdistrict's advisory board, to provide for the treatment and disposal of sewage from the subdistrict in or by means of facilities of the common sewer district not located within the subdistrict, in which case the board of trustees shall also have authority to charge a proportionate share of the costs of the common sewer district for operation and maintenance to revenues of the subdistrict and to consider such costs in determining reasonable charges to impose within the subdistrict under section 204.440.\n\n(L. 1992 H.B. 948 § 3, A.L. 2021 H.B. 271 merged with H.B. 734 merged with S.B. 44)",

Proceedings for the new formation of a reorganized common sewer district under sections 204.600 to 204.640 shall be substantially as follows: a petition in duplicate describing the proposed boundaries of the reorganized district sought to be formed, accompanied by a plat of the proposed district, shall first be filed with each county commission having jurisdiction in the geographic area the proposed district is situated. Such petition shall be ruled on by each county commission having jurisdiction within thirty days from the date of hearing the petition. If the petition for the reorganized district is rejected by any county commission having jurisdiction, no further action on the proposed district shall take place before the county commission which rejected the petition or the circuit court of that county in the county which rejected the petition. If approved by each county commission having jurisdiction, a petition in duplicate describing the proposed boundaries of the reorganized district sought to be formed, accompanied by a plat of the proposed district, shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county wherein the proposed district is situated or with the clerk of the circuit court of the county having the largest acreage proposed to be included in the proposed district, in the event that the proposed district embraces lands in more than one county. Such petition, in addition to such boundary description, shall set forth an estimate of the number of customers of the proposed district, the necessity for the formation of the district, the probable cost of acquiring or constructing sanitary sewer improvements with the district, if appropriate, an approximation of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the district, whether the board of trustees shall be elected or appointed by the county commission, and such other information as may be useful to the court in determining whether or not the petition should be granted and a decree of incorporation entered. Such petition shall be accompanied by a cash deposit of fifty dollars as an advancement of the costs of the proceeding. The petition shall be signed by not less than fifty voters or property owners within the proposed district and shall request the incorporation of the territory therein described into a reorganized common sewer district. The petition shall be verified by at least one of the signers.\n\n2. Upon filing, the petition shall be presented to the circuit court, and such court shall fix a date for a hearing on such petition, as provided in this section. The clerk of the court shall give notice of the petition filing in some newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proceedings are pending. If the district extends into any other county, such notice also shall be published in some newspaper of general circulation in such other county. The notice shall contain a description of the proposed boundary lines of the district and the general purposes of the petition. The notice shall set forth the date fixed for the hearing on the petition, which shall not be less than fifteen nor more than twenty-one days after the date of the last publication of the notice, and shall be on some regular judicial day of the court that the petition is pending. Such notice shall be signed by the clerk of the circuit court and shall be published in three successive issues of a weekly newspaper or in a daily paper once a week for three consecutive weeks.\n\n3. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the case or the hearing from time to time until final disposition.\n\n4. Exceptions to the formation of a district, or to the boundaries outlined in the petition for incorporation, may be made by any voter or property owner within the proposed districts, provided that such exceptions are filed not less than five days prior to the date set for the hearing on the petition. Such exceptions shall specify the grounds upon which the exceptions are being made. If any such exceptions are filed, the court shall take them into consideration in passing upon the petition and also shall consider the evidence in support of the petition and in support of the exceptions made. Should the court find that the petition should be granted but that changes should be made in the boundary lines, it shall make such changes in the boundary lines as set forth in the petition as the court may deem proper and enter its decree of incorporation, with such boundaries as changed. No public sewer district shall be formed under this chapter, chapter 249, section 247.035, or any sewer district created and organized under constitutional authority, the boundaries of which shall encroach upon the corporate boundaries of any sewer district then existing or upon the certificated boundaries then existing of any sewer corporation providing service under a certificate of convenience and necessity granted by the public service commission. Nor shall any public sewer district extend wastewater collection and treatment services within the boundaries of another district without a written cooperative agreement between such districts or within the certificated boundaries then existing of any sewer corporation providing service under a certificate of convenience and necessity granted by the public service commission without a written cooperative agreement between the public sewer district and the certificated sewer corporation.\n\n5. Should the court find that it would not be in the public interest to form such a district, the petition shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners. If the court should find in favor of the formation of such district, the court shall enter its decree of incorporation, setting forth the boundaries of the proposed district as determined by the court under the hearing. The decree shall further contain an appointment of five voters from the district to constitute the first board of trustees of the district. The court shall designate such trustees to staggered terms from one to five years such that one director is appointed or elected each year. The trustees appointed by the court shall serve for the terms designated and until their successors have been appointed or elected as provided in section 204.610. The decree shall further designate the name of the district by which it shall officially be known.\n\n6. The decree of incorporation shall not become final and conclusive until it is submitted to the voters residing within the boundaries described in such decree and until it is assented to by a majority of the voters as provided in subsection 9 of this section or by two-thirds of the voters of the district voting on the proposition. The decree shall provide for the submission of the question and shall fix the date of submission. The returns shall be certified by the election authority to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the case, and the court shall enter its order canvassing the returns and declaring the result of such election.\n\n7. If a majority of the voters of the district voting on such proposition approve of the proposition, then the court shall, in such order declaring the result of the election, enter a further order declaring the decree of incorporation to be final and conclusive. In the event, however, that the court should find that the question had not been assented to by the majority required in this section, the court shall enter a further order declaring such decree of incorporation to be void. No appeal shall be permitted from any such decree of incorporation nor from any of the aforesaid orders. In the event that the court declares the decree of incorporation to be final, the clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of such decree of incorporation and of such final order with the secretary of state of the state of Missouri, with the recorder of deeds of the county or counties in which the district is situated, and with the clerk of the county commission of the county or counties in which the district is situated.\n\n8. The costs incurred in the formation of the district shall be taxed to the district, if the district is incorporated; otherwise the costs shall be paid by the petitioners.\n\n9. If petitioners seeking formation of a reorganized common sewer district specify in their petition that the district to be organized shall be organized without authority to issue general obligation bonds, then the decree relating to the formation of the district shall recite that the district shall not have authority to issue general obligation bonds. The vote required for such a decree of incorporation to become final and conclusive shall be a simple majority of the voters of the district.\n\n10. Once a reorganized sewer district is established, the boundaries of the reorganized sewer district may be extended or enlarged from time to time upon the filing, with the clerk of the circuit court having jurisdiction, of a petition by either:\n\n(1) The board of trustees of the reorganized sewer district and five or more voters or landowners within the territory proposed to be added to the district; or\n\n(2) The board of trustees and a majority of the landowners within the territory that is proposed to be added to the reorganized sewer district.­­If the petition is filed by a majority of the voters or landowners within the territory proposed to be added to the reorganized sewer district, the publication of notice shall not be required, provided notice is posted in three public places within such territory at least seven days before the date of the hearing, and provided that there is sworn testimony by at least five landowners in such territory, or a majority of the landowners if the total landowners in the area are fewer than ten. Otherwise the procedures for notice substantially shall follow the procedures in subsection 2 of this section for formation. Territory proposed to be added to the reorganized sewer district may be either contiguous or reasonably close to the boundaries of the existing district, provided that it shall not include any territory within the corporate boundaries of any sewer district then existing or within the certificated boundaries then existing of any sewer corporation providing service under a certificate of convenience and necessity granted by the public service commission. Upon the entry of a final judgment declaring the court's decree of territory proposed to be added to the reorganized sewer district to be final and conclusive, the court shall modify or rearrange the boundary lines of the reorganized sewer district as may be necessary or advisable. The costs incurred in the enlargement or extension of the district shall be taxed to the district, if the district is enlarged or extended. Otherwise, such costs shall be paid by the petitioners. However, no costs shall be taxed to the trustees of the district.\n\n­­If the petition is filed by a majority of the voters or landowners within the territory proposed to be added to the reorganized sewer district, the publication of notice shall not be required, provided notice is posted in three public places within such territory at least seven days before the date of the hearing, and provided that there is sworn testimony by at least five landowners in such territory, or a majority of the landowners if the total landowners in the area are fewer than ten.

Should any landowner who owns real estate that is not within the certificated boundaries of any sewer corporation providing service under a certificate of convenience and necessity granted by the public service commission or within another sewer district organized under this chapter or chapters 247 or 249 or under the Missouri Constitution, but that is contiguous or reasonably close to the existing boundaries of the reorganized sewer district, desire to have such real estate incorporated in the district, the landowner shall first petition the board of trustees for its approval. If such approval is granted, the secretary of the board shall endorse a certificate of the board's approval of the petition. The petition so endorsed shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court in which the reorganized sewer district is incorporated. It then shall be the duty of the court to amend the boundaries of such district by a decree incorporating the real estate. A certified copy of this amended decree including the real estate in the district then shall be filed in the office of the recorder, in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real estate is located, and in the office of the secretary of state. The costs of this proceeding shall be borne by the petitioning property owner.\n\n12. The board of trustees of any reorganized common sewer district may petition the circuit court of the county containing the majority of the acreage in the district for an amended decree of incorporation to allow that district to engage in the construction, maintenance, and operation of water supply and distribution facilities that serve ten or more separate properties located wholly within the district, are not served by another political subdivision, or are not located within the certificated area of a water corporation as defined in chapter 386, or within a public water supply district as defined in chapter 247, and the operation and maintenance of all such existing water supply facilities. The petition shall be filed by the board of trustees, and all proceedings shall be in substantially the same manner as in action for initial formation of a reorganized common sewer district, except that no vote of the residents of the district shall be required. All applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply to the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply facilities in the same manner as they apply to like functions relating to sewer treatment facilities.\n\n(L. 2007 S.B. 22)",
