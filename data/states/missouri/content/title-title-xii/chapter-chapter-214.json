Under sections 214.140 to 214.180, and as otherwise not prohibited under Article VI, Section 23 of the Constitution of Missouri, the county commission may invest or loan said trust fund or funds in United States government, state, county or municipal bonds, certificates of deposit, first real estate mortgages, or deeds of trust and may utilize investment managers to invest, reinvest, and manage assets, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations provided in this section and Article IV, Section 15 of the Constitution of Missouri. When sufficient, the commission shall use the net income from said trust fund or funds or such investments or so much thereof as is necessary to support and maintain and beautify any public or private cemetery or any particular part thereof which may be designated by the person, persons or firm or association making said gift or bequest. If the net income from said trust fund or funds is not sufficient to support and maintain and beautify a cemetery, the commission may only use as much of the principal thereof as the commission deems necessary for the purpose of the basic maintenance to control the growth of grass and weeds. In maintaining or supporting the cemetery or any particular part or portion thereof the commission shall as nearly as possible follow the expressed wishes of the creator of said trust fund.\n\n2. An investment manager shall discharge his or her duties in the interest of the public or private cemetery and the interest of the person, persons, or firm making the gift or bequest and shall:\n\n(1) Act with the same care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a similar capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of a similar enterprise with similar aims;\n\n(2) Act with due regard for the management, reputation, and stability of the issuer and the character of the particular investments being considered;\n\n(3) Make investments for the purpose of supporting, maintaining, and beautifying any public or private cemetery or any particular part thereof, which may be designated by the person, persons, or firm or association making said gift or bequest, and of defraying reasonable expenses of investing the assets;\n\n(4) Give appropriate consideration to those facts and circumstances that the investment fiduciary knows or should know are relevant to the particular investment or investment course of action involved, including the role the investment or investment course of action plays in that portion of the investments for which the investment fiduciary has responsibility. For purposes of this subdivision,\"appropriate consideration\"shall include, but is not limited to, a determination by the investment fiduciary that a particular investment or investment course of action is reasonably designed to further the purposes of supporting, maintaining, and beautifying any public or private cemetery or any particular part thereof, which may be designated by the person, persons, or firm or association making said gift or bequest, while considering the risk of loss and the opportunity for gain or other return associated with the investment or investment course of action and considering the following factors as they relate to the investment or investment course of action:\n\n(a) The diversification of the investments;\n\n(b) The liquidity and current return of the investments relative to the anticipated cash flow requirements; and\n\n(c) The projected return of the investments relative to the funding objectives; and\n\n(5) Give appropriate consideration to investments that would enhance the general welfare of this state and its citizens if those investments offer the safety and rate of return comparable to other investments available to the investment fiduciary at the time the investment decision is made.\n\n3. As used in this section,\"invest\"or\"investment\"means utilization of moneys in the expectation of future returns in the form of income or capital gain.\n\n(RSMo 1939 § 15269, A.L. 2010 H.B. 1692, et al. merged with H.B. 2226, et al. merged with S.B. 753 merged with S.B. 754, A.L. 2017 H.B. 51, A.L. 2022 S.B. 886)\n\nPrior revision: 1929 § 14060",

If actions are taken by a city, town, village or county pursuant to this subsection, the city, town, village or county may assess all true costs of restoration, maintenance and operation against any responsible person, partnership or corporation whether such person, partnership or corporation is a lessee, lessor, equitable title holder or legal title holder to the unmaintained cemetery. Any city, town, village or county which assesses costs pursuant to this section reserves the right to pursue any and all legal, equitable or criminal remedies to collect such assessed costs. Any city, town, village or county which pursues a civil remedy pursuant to this section may employ independent attorneys and law firms to collect the costs of restoration, maintenance and operation of any unmaintained cemetery.\n\n2.

Endowed care fund held in trust or segregated account — requirements — duties of trustee or independent investment advisor — operator's duties — endowed care fund agreement. —1. (1) The endowed care trust fund required by sections 214.270 to 214.410 shall be permanently set aside in trust or in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2 of this section. The trustee of the endowed care trust shall be a state or federally chartered financial institution authorized to exercise trust powers in Missouri. The contact information for a trust officer or duly appointed representative of the trustee with knowledge and access to the trust fund accounting and trust fund records must be disclosed to the office or its duly authorized representative upon request.\n\n(2) The trust fund records, including all trust fund accounting records, shall be maintained in the state of Missouri at all times or shall be electronically stored so that the records may be made available in the state of Missouri within fifteen business days of receipt of a written request. The operator of an endowed care cemetery shall maintain a current name and address of the trustee and the records custodian for the endowed care trust fund and shall supply such information to the office, or its representative, upon request.\n\n(3) Missouri law shall control all endowed care trust funds and the Missouri courts shall have jurisdiction over endowed care trusts regardless of where records may be kept or various administrative tasks may be performed.\n\n2. An endowed care trust fund shall be administered in accordance with Missouri law governing trusts, including but not limited to the applicable provisions of chapters 456 and 469, except as specifically provided in this subsection or where the provisions of sections 214.270 to 214.410 provide differently, provided that a cemetery operator shall not in any circumstances be authorized to restrict, enlarge, change, or modify the requirements of this section or the provisions of chapters 456 and 469 by agreement or otherwise.\n\n(1) Income and principal of an endowed care trust fund shall be determined under the provisions of law applicable to trusts, except that the provisions of section 469.405 shall not apply.\n\n(2) No principal shall be distributed from an endowed care trust fund except to the extent that a unitrust election is in effect with respect to such trust under the provisions of section 469.411.\n\n(3) No right to transfer jurisdiction from Missouri under section 456.1-108 shall exist for endowed care trusts.\n\n(4) All endowed care trusts shall be irrevocable.\n\n(5) No trustee shall have the power to terminate an endowed care trust fund under the provisions of section 456.4-414.\n\n(6) A unitrust election made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 469 shall be made by the cemetery operator in the terms of the endowed care trust fund agreement itself, not by the trustee.\n\n(7) No contract of insurance shall be deemed a suitable investment for an endowed care trust fund.\n\n(8) The income from the endowed care fund may be distributed to the cemetery operator at least annually on a date designated by the cemetery operator, but no later than sixty days following the end of the trust fund year. Any income not distributed within sixty days following the end of the trust's fiscal year shall be added to and held as part of the principal of the trust fund.\n\n3. The cemetery operator shall have the duty and responsibility to apply the income distributed to provide care and maintenance only for that part of the cemetery designated as an endowed care section and not for any other purpose.\n\n4. In addition to any other duty, obligation, or requirement imposed by sections 214.270 to 214.410 or the endowed care trust agreement, the trustee's duties shall be the maintenance of records related to the trust and the accounting for and investment of moneys deposited by the operator to the endowed care trust fund.\n\n(1) For the purposes of sections 214.270 to 214.410, the trustee shall not be deemed responsible for the care, the maintenance, or the operation of the cemetery, or for any other matter relating to the cemetery, or the proper expenditure of funds distributed by the trustee to the cemetery operator, including, but not limited to, compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\n\n(2) With respect to cemetery property maintained by endowed care funds, the cemetery operator shall be responsible for the performance of the care and maintenance of the cemetery property.\n\n5. If the endowed care cemetery fund is not permanently set aside in a trust fund as required by subsection 1 of this section, then the funds shall be permanently set aside in an escrow account in the state of Missouri. Funds in an escrow account shall be placed in an endowed care trust fund under subsection 1 if the funds in the escrow account exceed three hundred fifty thousand dollars, unless otherwise approved by the division for good cause. The account shall be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or comparable deposit insurance and held in a state or federally chartered financial institution authorized to do business in Missouri and located in this state.\n\n(1) The interest from the escrow account may be distributed to the cemetery operator at least in annual or semiannual installments, but not later than six months following the calendar year. Any interest not distributed within six months following the end of the calendar year shall be added to and held as part of the principal of the account.\n\n(2) The cemetery operator shall have the duty and responsibility to apply the interest to provide care and maintenance only for that part of the cemetery in which burial space shall have been sold and with respect to which sales the escrow account shall have been established and not for any other purpose. The principal of such funds shall be kept intact. The cemetery operator's duties shall be the maintenance of records and the accounting for an investment of moneys deposited by the operator to the escrow account. For purposes of sections 214.270 to 214.410, the administrator of the office of endowed care cemeteries shall not be deemed to be responsible for the care, maintenance, or operation of the cemetery. With respect to cemetery property maintained by cemetery care funds, the cemetery operator shall be responsible for the performance of the care and maintenance of the cemetery property owned by the cemetery operator.\n\n(3) The division may approve an escrow agent if the escrow agent demonstrates the knowledge, skill, and ability to handle escrow funds and financial transactions and is of good moral character.\n\n6. The cemetery operator shall be accountable to the owners of burial space in the cemetery for compliance with sections 214.270 to 214.410.\n\n7. Excluding funds held in an escrow account, all endowed care trust funds shall be administered in accordance with an endowed care trust fund agreement, which shall be submitted to the office by the cemetery operator for review and approval. The endowed care cemetery shall be notified in writing by the office of endowed care cemeteries regarding the approval or disapproval of the endowed care trust fund agreement and regarding any changes required to be made for compliance with sections 214.270 to 214.410 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n8. All endowed care cemeteries shall be under a continuing duty to file with the office of endowed care cemeteries and to submit for prior approval any and all changes, amendments, or revisions of the endowed care trust fund agreement at least thirty days before the effective date of such change, amendment, or revision.\n\n9. If the endowed care trust fund agreement, or any changes, amendments, or revisions filed with the office, are not disapproved by the office within thirty days after submission by the cemetery operator, the endowed care trust fund agreement, or the related change, amendment, or revision, shall be deemed approved and may be used by the cemetery operator and the trustee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the office may review and disapprove an endowed care trust fund agreement, or any submitted change, amendment, or revision, after the thirty days provided herein or at any other time if the agreement is not in compliance with sections 214.270 to 214.410 or the rules promulgated thereunder. Notice of disapproval by the office shall be in writing and delivered to the cemetery operator and the trustee within ten days of disapproval.\n\n10. Funds in an endowed care trust fund or escrow account may be commingled with endowed care funds for other endowed care cemeteries, provided that the cemetery operator and the trustee shall maintain adequate accounting records of the disbursements, contributions, and income allocated for each cemetery.\n\n11. By accepting the trusteeship of an endowed care trust or accepting funds as an escrow agent pursuant to sections 214.270 to 214.410, the trustee or escrow agent submits personally to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and the office of endowed care cemeteries regarding the administration of the trust or escrow account. A trustee or escrow agent shall consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the state of Missouri and the office in regards to the trusteeship or the operation of the escrow account and to the appointment of the office of secretary of state as its agent for service of process regarding any administrative or legal actions relating to the trust or the escrow account, if it has no designated agent for service of process located in this state.

Burial merchandise or services, deferral of delivery, when — escrow arrangement — distribution of moneys — cancellation. —1. With the exception of sales made pursuant to section 214.385, all sales of prearranged burial merchandise and services shall be made pursuant to this section.\n\n2. Upon written instructions from the purchaser of burial merchandise or burial services set forth in a cemetery prearranged contract, a cemetery may defer delivery of such burial merchandise or a warehouse receipt for the same under section 214.385, or performance of services, to a date designated by the purchaser, provided the cemetery operator, after deducting sales and administrative costs associated with the sale, not to exceed twenty percent of the purchase price, deposits the remaining portion of the purchase price into an escrow or trust account as herein provided, within sixty days following receipt of payment from the purchaser. Funds so deposited pursuant to this section shall be maintained in such account until delivery of the property or the performance of services is made or the contract for the purchase of such property or services is cancelled, and fees and costs associated with the maintenance of the trust or escrow arrangement shall be charged to these funds. The account is subject to inspection, examination or audit by the division. No withdrawals may be made from the escrow or trust account established pursuant to this section except as herein provided.\n\n3. Each escrow arrangement must comply with the following:\n\n(1) The escrow agent shall be located in Missouri, authorized to exercise escrow powers, and shall maintain the escrow records so that they may be accessed and produced for inspection within five business days of the agent's receipt of a written request made by the office or its duly authorized representative. A cemetery operator shall not serve as an escrow agent for the cemetery operator's account nor shall the escrow agent be employed by or under common ownership with the cemetery operator. The cemetery operator shall maintain a current name and address for the escrow agent with the office, and shall obtain written approval from the office before making any change in the name or address of the escrow agent. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, information regarding the escrow agent shall be deemed an open record;\n\n(2) The escrow account funds shall be maintained in depository accounts at a Missouri financial institution that provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or comparable deposit insurance;\n\n(3) The escrow arrangement shall be administered by the escrow agent pursuant to an agreement approved by the office under the same filing and approval procedure as that set forth for endowed care trust fund agreements in section 214.330;\n\n(4) The operator shall establish a separate depository account for each cemetery prearranged contract administered pursuant to this subsection;\n\n(5) The division may promulgate by rule a form escrow agreement to be used by a cemetery operator operating pursuant to this section.\n\n4. Each trust must comply with the following:\n\n(1) The trustee shall be a state or federally chartered financial institution authorized to exercise trust powers in Missouri, provided that a foreign financial institution must be approved by the office;\n\n(2) The trust fund records, including all trust fund accounting records, shall either be maintained in the state of Missouri or shall be electronically stored so that the records may be made available within fifteen business days of the trustee's receipt of a written request made by the office or its duly authorized representative. The cemetery operator shall maintain a current name and address of the trustee and the records custodian and shall supply such information to the office or its representative upon request;\n\n(3) The principal of such funds shall be appropriately invested pursuant to the prudent investor rule under chapter 469, provided that no trust funds shall be invested in any term insurance product;\n\n(4) Payments regarding two or more cemetery prearranged contracts may be deposited into and commingled in the same trust, so long as adequate records are made available to the trustee to account for cemetery prearranged contracts on an individual basis with regard to deposits, earnings, distributions, and any taxes;\n\n(5) Trust instruments shall be subject to the same filing and approval procedure as that set forth for endowed care trust fund agreements under section 214.330;\n\n(6) A trustee may commingle the funds from trusts of unrelated cemetery operators for investment purposes if the trustee has adequate accounting for the allocations, disbursements, payments, and income among the participating trusts.\n\n5. The income from escrow accounts, after payment of expenses associated with the arrangement, shall be distributed to the cemetery operator. All other distributions from trusts and escrow accounts shall be made pursuant to forms approved by the office. For performance of a cemetery prearranged contract, a certificate of performance form signed by the cemetery operator shall be required for distribution. For cancellation of a cemetery prearranged contract, a certificate of cancellation form signed by the cemetery operator and the purchaser shall be required for distribution.\n\n6. A cemetery prearranged contract is subject to cancellation as follows:\n\n(1) At any time before the final disposition of the deceased, or before the services or merchandise described in this section are provided, the purchaser may cancel the contract without cause by delivering written notice thereof to the operator. Within fifteen days after its receipt of such notice, the cemetery operator shall pay to the purchaser a net amount equal to eighty percent of all payments made under the contract. The cemetery operator shall be entitled to keep one-half of the interest earned on trust funds. Upon delivery of the purchaser's receipt for such payment to the escrow agent or trustee, the escrow agent or trustee shall distribute to the cemetery operator from the escrow account or trust an amount equal to all deposits made into the escrow account or trust for the contract;\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, if a purchaser is eligible, becomes eligible, or desires to become eligible, to receive public assistance under chapter 208 or any other applicable state or federal law, the purchaser may irrevocably waive and renounce his right to cancel the contract pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section, which waiver and renunciation shall be made in writing and delivered to the cemetery operator;\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, any purchaser, within thirty days of receipt of the executed contract, may cancel the contract without cause by delivering written notice thereof to the cemetery operator, and receive a full refund of all payments made on the contract;\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, once any purchase order is entered for the production or manufacture of burial merchandise, per the purchaser's written request, the purchaser's obligation to pay for said burial merchandise shall be noncancellable;\n\n(5) No funds subject to a purchaser's right of cancellation hereunder shall be subject to the claims of the cemetery operator's creditors.\n\n7. Burial merchandise sold through a contract with a cemetery or cemetery operator which is entered into after the death of the individual for whom the burial merchandise is intended shall not be subject to any trusting or escrow requirement of this section.\n\n8.

      "text": "Title XII PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nChapter 214\n\n214.389. Suspension of distribution, when, procedure. —1. The division may direct a trustee, financial institution, or escrow agent to suspend distribution from an endowed care trust fund or escrow account if the cemetery operator does not have a current and active cemetery operator license, has failed to file an annual report, or if, after an audit or examination, the division determines there is a deficiency in an endowed care trust fund or escrow account maintained under section 214.330 and the cemetery operator has failed to file a corrective action plan detailing how the deficiency shall be remedied. For purposes of this section, a deficiency shall only be deemed to exist if, after an audit or examination, the division determines a cemetery operator has failed to deposit the total aggregate of funds required to be deposited in trust or an escrow account pursuant to section 214.320 or subsection 1 of section 214.335, or has received disbursements from the trust or escrow account in excess of what is permitted under section 214.330. No deficiency shall be deemed to be created by fluctuations in the value of investments held in trust or escrow.\n\n2. The division shall provide written notification to the cemetery operator and the trustee, financial institution, or escrow agent within fourteen days of discovering a potential violation as described in this section. Upon receipt of written notification from the division, the cemetery operator shall have sixty days to cure any alleged violations or deficiencies cited in the notification without a suspension of distribution. If, after the sixty-day time period, the division feels the cemetery has not cured the alleged violations or deficiencies cited in the notification, the division may send a notice of suspension to the cemetery operator that the division is ordering a suspension of distribution as described in this section. In the event of a suspension of distribution, the amount of any distribution suspended shall become principal, with credit against the deficiency, unless the cemetery operator files an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction or with the administrative hearing commission, as provided herein. In the event of an appeal, a cemetery operator may request the court or administrative hearing commission stay the suspension of distribution after a showing of necessity and good cause or authorize payment from the endowed care trust fund or escrow account for necessary expenses from any amount subject to distribution.\n\n3. Upon receipt of an order from the division suspending distribution pursuant to this section, a trustee, financial institution, or escrow agent shall immediately suspend distribution as required by the order. A trustee, financial institution, or escrow agent shall be exempt from liability for failure to distribute funds as ordered by the division.\n\n4. A cemetery operator may appeal an order suspending distribution pursuant to this section to the administrative hearing commission. The administrative hearing commission shall receive notice of such appeal within thirty days from the date the notice of suspension was mailed by certified mail. Failure of a person whose license was suspended to notify the administrative hearing commission of his or her intent to appeal waives all rights to appeal the suspension. Upon notice of such person's intent to appeal, a hearing shall be held before the administrative hearing commission pursuant to chapter 621.\n\n5. A cemetery operator may apply for reinstatement of distributions upon demonstration that the deficiencies or other problems have been cured or that the operator has otherwise come into compliance.\n\n6. The division may promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2010, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2010 H.B. 1692, et al. merged with H.B. 2226, et al. merged with S.B. 754)",
