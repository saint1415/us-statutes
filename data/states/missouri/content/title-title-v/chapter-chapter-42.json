There is established in the state treasury a special trust fund, to be known as the \"Veterans' Trust Fund\". The state treasurer shall credit to and deposit in the veterans' trust fund all amounts received under section 143.1001, and any other amounts which may be received from grants, gifts, bequests, the federal government, or other sources granted or given for this specific purpose.\n\n2. The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the veterans' trust fund in the same manner as surplus state funds are invested pursuant to section 30.260. All earnings resulting from the investment of moneys in the veterans' trust fund shall be credited to the veterans' trust fund.\n\n3. Until the amount in the veterans' trust fund exceeds one million dollars, not more than one-half of the money deposited in the veterans' trust fund each year from contributions made under section 143.1001 plus all earnings from the investment of moneys in the trust fund credited during the previous fiscal year, shall be available for disbursement by the commission in accordance with sections 42.002 to 42.135 and section 143.1001. When the state treasurer certifies that the assets in the veterans' trust fund exceed one million dollars, then, from that time on, all credited earnings plus all future annual deposits to the fund from contributions made under section 143.1001 shall be available for disbursement by the commission within the limits of appropriations and for the purposes provided by sections 42.002 to 42.135 and section 143.1001. The general assembly may appropriate moneys annually from the veterans' trust fund to the department of revenue to offset costs incurred for collecting and transferring funds under section 143.1001. Moneys appropriated to the department of revenue for such costs shall be reasonable and shall not exceed five percent of the revenues credited to the fund pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of this section during the preceding fiscal year.\n\n4. Except as provided in subsection 5 of this section, funds appropriated by the general assembly from the veterans' trust fund shall only be used by the commission for purposes authorized under sections 42.002 to 42.135 and section 143.1001, and shall not be used to supplant any existing program or service.\n\n5. Funds received from gifts, bequests, contributions other than contributions made pursuant to section 143.1001, grants, and federal funds may be used and expended by the commission for such purposes as may be specified in any requirements, terms or conditions attached thereto or, in the absence of any specific requirements, terms or conditions, as the commission may determine for any lawful purpose.\n\n6. The provisions of section 33.080 requiring all unexpended balances remaining in various state funds to be transferred and placed to the credit of the ordinary revenue fund of this state at the end of each biennium shall not apply to the veterans' trust fund.\n\n(L. 1989 H.B. 850, A.L. 1993 H.B. 592)\n\nCROSS REFERENCE:\n\nDonation of a portion of income tax refund to veterans' trust fund, 143.1001",
