If the contractor has not received from the claimant within thirty days after the claimant's receipt of the contractor's response either an acceptance or rejection of the inspection proposal or settlement offer, the contractor may at any time thereafter terminate the proposal or offer by serving written notice to the claimant. If the contractor so terminates the proposal, the claimant may thereafter bring an action against the contractor for the defect described in the notice of claim without further notice.\n\n(3) If the claimant elects to accept the offer of the contractor to remedy the claim without an inspection pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section, or if the claimant elects to accept the offer of the contractor to remedy part of the claim without inspection and compromise and settle the remainder of the claim by monetary payment pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the claimant shall provide the contractor and its contractors or other agents reasonable access to the claimant's residence during normal working hours to perform and complete the construction or work in accordance with the timetable stated in the offer. Any dispute relating to performance of the remedial construction or work by the contractor may be resolved by mediation in accordance with section 436.362. If the dispute is not resolved by mediation, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the defect described in the notice of claim.\n\n4. (1) If the claimant elects to allow the contractor to inspect in accordance with the contractor's proposal pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 2 of this section, within fourteen days after the date of the claimant's election to allow an inspection is communicated to the contractor, the claimant and contractor shall agree on a time and date for the inspection, and such inspection shall occur within fourteen days from the date of the communication of such election for an inspection unless the claimant and contractor agree to a later date. The claimant shall provide the contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, or other agents reasonable access to the claimant's residence during normal working hours to inspect the premises and the claimed defect. The contractor shall perform the inspection at its own cost. If destructive testing is necessary, the contractor shall repair all damage caused by the testing.\n\n(2) Within fourteen days following completion of the inspection, the contractor shall serve a report of the scope of the inspection and the findings and results of the inspection on the claimant, and either:\n\n(a) A written offer to remedy all of the claim at no cost to the claimant, including a description of the construction or work necessary to remedy the defect described in the claim, and a timetable for the completion of such construction or work; or\n\n(b) A written offer to remedy part of the claim, and compromise and settle the remainder of the claim by monetary payment, within a specified time frame; or\n\n(c) A written offer to compromise and settle all of the claim by monetary payment pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection 2 of this section; or\n\n(d) A written statement that the contractor will not proceed further to remedy the defect.\n\n(3) If the contractor does not proceed further to remedy the construction defect within the stated timetable, or if the contractor fails to comply with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the defect described in the notice of claim without further notice.\n\n(4) If the claimant rejects the offer made by the contractor pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of subdivision (2) of this subsection to either remedy the construction defect or remedy part of the claim and make a monetary settlement as to the remainder of the claim or to compromise and settle the claim by monetary payment, the claimant shall serve written notice of the claimant's rejection and the reasons for the rejection on the contractor. After service of the rejection notice, the claimant and contractor may attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation in accordance with section 436.362. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the defect described in the notice of claim. If the contractor has not received from the claimant within thirty days after the claimant's receipt of the contractor's response either an acceptance or rejection of the offer made pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the contractor may at any time thereafter terminate the offer by serving written notice to the claimant. If the contractor so terminates its offer, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the claim described in the notice of claim without further notice.\n\n5. (1) Any claimant accepting the offer of a contractor to remedy all or part of the construction defect pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subdivision (2) of subsection 4 of this section shall do so by serving the contractor with a written notice of acceptance within a reasonable time period after receipt of the offer, and no later than thirty days after receipt of the offer. The claimant shall provide the contractor and its subcontractors or other agents reasonable access to the claimant's residence during normal working hours to perform and complete the construction or work by the timetable stated in the offer. Any dispute relating to performance of the remedial construction or work by the contractor may be resolved by mediation in accordance with section 436.362. If the dispute is not resolved by mediation, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the defect described in the notice of claim.\n\n(2) The claimant and contractor may, by mutual written agreement, alter the extent of construction or the timetable for completion of construction stated in the offer, including, but not limited to, repair of additional defects.\n\n6. Any action commenced by a claimant prior to compliance with the requirements of this section shall, upon motion by a party to the action, be subject to dismissal without prejudice, and shall not be recommenced until the claimant has complied with the requirements of this section if the court finds the claimant knowingly violated the sections of said act.\n\n7. The claimant may amend the notice of claim to include construction defects discovered after the service of the original notice of claim and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this section for the additional claims. Claims for defects discovered after the commencement or recommencement of an action may be added to such action only after providing notice to the contractor of the defect and allowing for response under subsection 2 of this section.\n\n8. If, during the pendency of the notice, inspection, offer, acceptance, or repair process, an applicable limitations period would otherwise expire, the claimant may file an action against the contractor, but such action shall be immediately abated pending completion of the notice of claim process described in this section. This subsection shall not be construed either to revive a statute of limitations period that has expired prior to the date on which a claimant's written notice of claim is served or extend any applicable statute of repose.\n\n9. A written notice of claim and any written response by a contractor shall be treated as a settlement offer and shall not be admissible in an action related to a construction defect asserted therein, except as otherwise permitted by law. A written notice of claim and any written response by a contractor shall not be admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.\n\n10. In the event that immediate action must be taken by a claimant to prevent imminent injury to persons because of alleged construction defects, including defective garage doors, that threaten the life or safety of persons, or alleged construction defects, including defective garage doors, that if not addressed will result in significant and material additional damage to the residence, the homeowner or another person designated by the homeowner including the contractor may undertake reasonable repairs necessary to mitigate the emergency situation. Claimants may thereafter include the cost of such repairs in the written notice of claim of construction defects provided for in subsection 1 of this section. Provided, however, that other than the undertaking of immediate repairs to remedy an emergency situation, any repairs to construction defects undertaken by homeowners shall not be included in claims initiated under subsection 1 of this section, and shall not be the subject of an action.\n\n11. Any mediation shall take place in the county where the claimant resides or in a mutually agreed to location.\n\n(L. 2005 S.B. 168 § 431.306)",

Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent or more of the voting securities. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing to the board that control does not in fact exist.\n\n7. Payments regarding two or more preneed contracts may be deposited into and commingled in the same preneed trust, so long as the trustee maintains adequate records that individually and separately identify the payments, earnings, and distributions for each preneed contract.\n\n8. Within a reasonable time after accepting a trusteeship or receiving trust assets, a trustee shall review the trust assets and make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of assets in order to bring the trust portfolio into compliance with the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, other circumstances of the trust, and all other requirements of sections 436.400 to 436.520.\n\n9. All expenses of establishing and administering a preneed trust, including trustee's fees, legal and accounting fees, investment expenses, and taxes may be paid from income generated from the investment of the trust assets. Principal of the trust shall not be used to pay the costs of administration. If the income of the trust is insufficient to pay the costs of administration, those costs shall be paid as per the written agreements between the seller, provider and the trustee.\n\n10. The seller and provider of a trust-funded guaranteed preneed contract shall be entitled to all income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, capital gains, and losses generated by the investment of preneed trust property regarding such contract as stipulated in the contract between the seller and provider. Income of the trust, excluding expenses allowed under this subsection, shall accrue through the life of the trust, except in instances when a contract is cancelled. The trustee of the trust may distribute market value of all income, net of losses, to the seller upon, but not before, the final disposition of the beneficiary and provision of the funeral and burial services and facilities, and merchandise to, or for, the benefit of the beneficiary. This subsection shall apply to trusts established on or after August 28, 2009.\n\n11. Providers shall request payment by submitting a certificate of performance to the seller certifying that the provider has rendered services under the contract or as requested. The certificate shall be signed by both the provider and the person authorized to make arrangements on behalf of the beneficiary. If there is no written contract between the seller and provider, the provider shall be entitled to the market value of all trust*assets allocable to the preneed contract. Sellers shall remit payment to the provider within sixty days of receiving the certificate of performance.\n\n12. If a seller fails to make timely payment of an amount due a provider under sections 436.400 to 436.520, the provider shall have the right, in addition to other rights and remedies against such seller, to make demand upon the trustee of the preneed trust for the contract to distribute to the provider from the trust all amounts to which the seller would be entitled to receive for the preneed contract.\n\n13. The trustee of a preneed trust, including trusts established before August 28, 2009, shall maintain adequate books and records of all transactions administered over the life of the trust and pertaining to the trust generally. The trustee shall assist the seller who established the trust or its successor in interest in the preparation of the annual report described in section 436.460. The seller shall furnish to each contract purchaser, within thirty days after receipt of the purchaser's written request, a written statement of all deposits made to such trust regarding such purchaser's contract including the principal and interest paid to date.\n\n14. A preneed trust, including trusts established before August 28, 2009, shall terminate when the trust principal no longer includes any payments made under any preneed contract, and upon such termination the trustee shall distribute all trust property, including principal and undistributed income, to the seller which established the trust.\n\n(L. 2009 S.B. 1)\n\n*Word \"trusts\" appears in original rolls.",

A consumer legal funding company shall not engage in the business of consumer legal funding in this state unless it has first obtained a license from the division of finance.\n\n2. A consumer legal funding company's initial or renewal license application shall be in writing, made under oath, and on a form provided by the director.\n\n3. Every consumer legal funding company, at the time of filing a license application, shall pay the sum of five hundred fifty dollars for the period ending the thirtieth day of June next following the date of payment; thereafter, a like fee shall be paid on or before June thirtieth of each year and shall be credited to the division of finance fund established under section 361.170.\n\n4. A consumer legal funding license shall not be issued unless the division of finance, upon investigation, finds that the character and fitness of the applicant company, and of the officers and directors thereof, are such as to warrant belief that the business shall operate honestly and fairly within the purposes of sections 436.550 to 436.572.\n\n5. Every applicant shall also, at the time of filing such application, file a bond satisfactory to the division of finance in an amount not to exceed fifty thousand dollars. The bond shall provide that the applicant shall faithfully conform to and abide by the provisions of sections 436.550 to 436.572, to all rules lawfully made by the director under sections 436.550 to 436.572, and the bond shall act as a surety for any person or the state for any and all amount of moneys that may become due or owing from the applicant under and by virtue of sections 436.550 to 436.572, which shall include the result of any action that occurred while the bond was in place for the applicable period of limitations under statute and so long as the bond is not exhausted by valid claims.\n\n6. If an action is commenced on a licensee's bond, the director may require the filing*of a new bond. Immediately upon any recovery on the bond, the licensee shall file a new bond.\n\n7. To ensure the effective supervision and enforcement of sections 436.550 to 436.572, the director may, under chapter 536:\n\n(1) Deny, suspend, revoke, condition, or decline to renew a license for a violation of sections 436.550 to 436.572, rules issued under sections 436.550 to 436.572, or order or directive entered under sections 436.550 to 436.572;\n\n(2) Deny, suspend, revoke, condition, or decline to renew a license if an applicant or licensee fails at any time to meet the requirements of sections 436.550 to 436.572, or withholds information or makes a material misstatement in an application for a license or renewal of a license;\n\n(3) Order restitution against persons subject to sections 436.550 to 436.572 for violations of sections 436.550 to 436.572; and\n\n(4) Order or direct such other affirmative action as the director deems necessary.\n\n8. Any letter issued by the director and declaring grounds for denying or declining to grant or renew a license may be appealed to the circuit court of Cole County. All other matters presenting a contested case involving a licensee may be heard by the director under chapter 536.\n\n9. Notwithstanding the prior approval requirement of subsection 1 of this section, a consumer legal funding company that has applied with the division of finance between August 28, 2023, or when the division of finance has made applications available to the public, whichever is later, and six months thereafter may engage in consumer legal funding while the license application of the company or an affiliate of the company is awaiting approval by the division of finance and until such time as the applicant has pursued all appellate remedies and procedures for any denial of such application. All funding contracts in effect prior to August 28, 2023, are not subject to the terms of sections 436.550 to 436.572.\n\n10. If it appears to the director that any consumer legal funding company is failing, refusing, or neglecting to make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of sections 436.550 to 436.572, or any laws or rules relating to consumer legal funding, the director may issue an order to cease and desist, which may be enforceable by a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars per day for each day that the neglect, failure, or refusal continues. The penalty shall be assessed and collected by the director. In determining the amount of the penalty, the director shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the gravity of the violation, any history of previous violations, and any other matters justice may require.\n\n11. If any consumer legal funding company fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the provisions of sections 436.550 to 436.572, or of any laws or rules relating to consumer legal funding, its license may be suspended or revoked by order of the director after a hearing before said director on any order to show cause why such order of suspension or revocation should not be entered and that specifies the grounds therefor. Such an order shall be served on the particular consumer legal funding company at least ten days prior to the hearing. Any order made and entered by the director may be appealed to the circuit court of Cole County.\n\n12. (1) The division shall conduct an examination of each consumer funding company at least once every twenty-four months and at such other times as the director may determine.\n\n(2) For any such investigation or examination, the director and his or her representatives shall have free and immediate access to the place or places of business and the books and records, and shall have the authority to place under oath all persons whose testimony may be required relative to the affairs and business of the consumer legal funding company.\n\n(3) The director may also make such special investigations or examination as the director deems necessary to determine whether any consumer legal funding company has violated any of the provisions of sections 436.550 to 436.572 or rules promulgated thereunder, and the director may assess the reasonable costs of any investigation or examination incurred by the division to the company.\n\n13. The division of finance shall have the authority to promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of sections 436.550 to 436.572. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2023, shall be invalid and void.\n\n(L. 2023 S.B. 103)\n\n*Word \"filling\" appears in original rolls.",

The amount of the settlement described in subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section shall be increased every five years beginning January 1, 2027, based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the United States (CPI-U), or its successor index, as such index is defined and officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency. For purposes of this section, any increase in the consumer price index shall be determined based upon the percentage increase of the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year over the consumer price index for the calendar year five years prior thereto.\n\n5.

The attorney shall provide notice of the deposit to the minor and the person entering into the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor. Notice shall be delivered by personal service or first class mail;\n\n(2) If the minor or person entering into the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor is not represented by an attorney and the settlement is paid:\n\n(a) In cash or by draft, the person entering into the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor shall deposit the moneys directly into a uniform transfer to minors account for the sole benefit of the minor; or\n\n(b) By direct deposit, the person entering into the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor shall provide the person or entity with whom the minor has settled the claim with information sufficient to complete an electronic transfer of settlement funds within ten business days of the settlement into a uniform transfer to minors account for the sole benefit of the minor and the person or entity with whom the minor has settled shall provide notice of the electronic transfer by personal service or first class mail to the minor and the person entering the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor;\n\n(3) If paid by purchase of an annuity, the moneys shall be paid by direct payment to the provider of the annuity with the minor designated as the sole beneficiary of the annuity; or\n\n(4) If the minor is in the custody of the state and the settlement is paid in cash, the moneys shall be deposited directly into a trust account or subaccount of a trust account established by the children's division of the department of social services for the purpose of receiving moneys payable to the minor in the custody of the state under the settlement agreement and that earns interest for the benefit of the minor in the custody of the state.\n\n6. The moneys in the minor's savings account, trust account, or trust subaccount established in subsection 5 of this section may not be withdrawn, removed, paid out, or transferred to any person, including the minor, except as follows:\n\n(1) Pursuant to a court order;\n\n(2) Upon the minor's attainment of eighteen years of age;\n\n(3) At the direction of a duly appointed conservator;\n\n(4) At the direction of the custodian for the uniform transfer to minors account for the sole benefit of the minor; or\n\n(5) Upon the minor's death.\n\n7. If a settlement agreement is entered into in compliance with subsection 2 of this section, the signature of the person entering into the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor is binding on the minor without the need for further court approval or review and has the same force and effect as if the minor were a competent adult entering into the settlement agreement.\n\n8.
