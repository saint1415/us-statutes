(Effective July 1, 2026.)\n\n(1) The legislature finds that a full set of project procurement, contracting, financing, and funding tools are needed to enable the delivery of transportation projects in a manner most advantageous to the public. Current public-private partnership laws have failed to spur innovative proposals from the private sector or new project delivery approaches from the department of transportation.(2) The legislature confirms the findings from previous studies that current laws and administrative processes are the primary obstacle impairing the state's ability to utilize public-private partnerships. The legislature finds that a new public-private partnership law is needed to:(a) Transparently demonstrate and deliver better value for the public including, but not limited to, expedited project delivery and more effective management of project life-cycle costs;(b) Provide an additional option for delivering complex transportation projects, including addressing a shortage of truck parking;(c) Incorporate private sector expertise and innovation into transportation project delivery;(d) Allocate project risks to the parties best able to manage those risks;(e) Allow new sources of private capital;(f) Increase access to federal funding and financing mechanisms;(g) Better align private sector incentives with public priorities; and(h) Provide consistency in the review and approval processes for the full range of project delivery tools and contracting methods.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that a full set of project procurement, contracting, financing, and funding tools are needed to enable the delivery of transportation projects in a manner most advantageous to the public.
