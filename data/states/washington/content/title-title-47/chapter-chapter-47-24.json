However, pavement trenching and restoration performed as part of installation of such facilities must meet or exceed requirements established by the department;(5) The city or town has the right to grant the privilege to open the surface of any such street, but all damage occasioned thereby shall promptly be repaired either by the city or town itself or at its direction.

When the population of a city or town first exceeds 27,500 according to the determination of population by the office of financial management, the city or town shall have three years from the date of the determination to plan for additional staffing, budgetary, and equipment requirements before being required to assume the responsibilities under this subsection.
