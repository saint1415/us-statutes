This program is limited to the reimbursement provided in this section.(3) An employee is entitled to receive the reimbursement provided in this section only if the secretary finds that each of the following has occurred:(a) A motorist has assaulted the employee who is engaged in highway construction or maintenance along a roadway right-of-way (fence line to fence line, landscaped areas) or service of the vessel as a maritime employee or terminal employee engaged in the loading or unloading of passenger vehicles and as a result the employee has sustained demonstrated physical injuries that have required the employee to miss one or more days of work;(b) The assault is not attributable to any extent to the employee's negligence, misconduct, or failure to comply with any rules or conditions of employment; and(c) The department of labor and industries has approved the employee's workers' compensation application under chapter 51.32 RCW, or for maritime employees the department of transportation risk management office has approved maintenance and cure benefits under 46 U.S.C.

The accommodation must be in the form of an agreement between the applicable local transit agency and the private transportation provider. The transit agency may require that the agreement include provisions to recover actual costs and fair market value for the use of the lot and its related facilities and to provide adequate insurance and indemnification of the transit agency, and other reasonable provisions to ensure that the private transportation provider's use does not unduly burden the transit agency. The transit agency may consider benefits to its public transportation system when establishing an amount to charge for the use of the park and ride lot and its related facilities. If the agreement includes provisions to recover actual costs, the private transportation provider is responsible to remit the full actual costs of park and ride lot use to the appropriate transit agency. No accommodation is required, and any agreement may be terminated, if the park and ride lot is at or exceeds ninety percent capacity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday for two consecutive months.
