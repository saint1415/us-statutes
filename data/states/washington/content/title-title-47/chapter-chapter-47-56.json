(Effective until July 1, 2026.)\n\n(1) Except as permitted under chapter 47.29 or 47.46 RCW:(a) Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department of transportation shall have full charge of the planning, analysis, and construction of all toll bridges and other toll facilities including the Washington state ferries, and the operation and maintenance thereof.(b) The transportation commission shall determine and establish the tolls and charges thereon.(c) Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department shall have full charge of planning, analysis, and design of all toll facilities. The department may conduct the planning, analysis, and design of toll facilities as necessary to support the legislature's consideration of toll authorization.(d) The department shall utilize and administer toll collection systems that are simple, unified, and interoperable. To the extent practicable, the department shall avoid the use of toll booths. The department shall set the statewide standards and protocols for all toll facilities within the state, including those authorized by local authorities.(e) Except as provided in this section, the department shall proceed with the construction of such toll bridges and other facilities and the approaches thereto by contract in the manner of state highway construction immediately upon there being made available funds for such work and shall prosecute such work to completion as rapidly as practicable. The department is authorized to negotiate contracts for any amount without bid under (e)(i) and (ii) of this subsection:(i) Emergency contracts, in order to make repairs to ferries or ferry terminal facilities or removal of such facilities whenever continued use of ferries or ferry terminal facilities constitutes a real or immediate danger to the traveling public or precludes prudent use of such ferries or facilities; and(ii) Single source contracts for vessel dry dockings, when there is clearly and legitimately only one available bidder to conduct dry dock-related work for a specific class or classes of vessels. The contracts may be entered into for a single vessel dry docking or for multiple vessel dry dockings for a period not to exceed two years.(f) Any new vessel planning, construction, purchase, analysis, or design work must be consistent with RCW 47.60.810, except as otherwise provided in RCW 47.60.826.(2) The department shall proceed with the procurement of materials, supplies, services, and equipment needed for the support, maintenance, and use of a ferry, ferry terminal, or other facility operated by Washington state ferries, in accordance with chapter 43.19 RCW except as follows:(a) When the secretary of the department of transportation determines in writing that the use of invitation for bid is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state and it may be necessary to make competitive evaluations, including technical or performance evaluations among acceptable proposals to complete the contract award, a contract may be entered into by use of a competitive sealed proposals method, and a formal request for proposals solicitation. Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.(b) When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:(i) The ability, capacity, and skill of the proposer to perform the contract or provide the service required;(ii) The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the proposer;(iii) Whether the proposer can perform the contract within the time specified;(iv) The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;(v) The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;(vi) Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include but are not limited to items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and(vii) Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.(c) When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.\n\n(1) Except as permitted under chapter 47.29 or 47.46 RCW:\n\n(a) Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department of transportation shall have full charge of the planning, analysis, and construction of all toll bridges and other toll facilities including the Washington state ferries, and the operation and maintenance thereof.\n\n(b) The transportation commission shall determine and establish the tolls and charges thereon.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department shall have full charge of planning, analysis, and design of all toll facilities.

Washington should use tolling to encourage effective use of the transportation system and provide a source of transportation funding.(2) When to use tolling. Tolling should be used when it can be demonstrated to contribute a significant portion of the cost of a project that cannot be funded solely with existing sources or optimize the performance of the transportation system. Such tolling should, in all cases, be fairly and equitably applied in the context of the statewide transportation system and not have significant adverse impacts through the diversion of traffic to other routes that cannot otherwise be reasonably mitigated. Such tolling should also consider relevant social equity, environmental, and economic issues, and should be directed at making progress toward the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.(3) Use of toll revenue. All revenue from an eligible toll facility must be used only to improve, preserve, manage, or operate the eligible toll facility on or in which the revenue is collected. Additionally, toll revenue should provide for and encourage the inclusion of recycled and reclaimed construction materials.(4) Setting toll rates. Toll rates, which may include variable pricing, must be set to meet anticipated funding obligations. To the extent possible, the toll rates should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue.(5) Duration of toll collection. Because transportation infrastructure projects have costs and benefits that extend well beyond those paid for by initial construction funding, tolls on future toll facilities may remain in place to fund additional capacity, capital rehabilitation, maintenance, management, and operations, and to optimize performance of the system.\n\nAny proposal for the establishment of eligible toll facilities shall consider the following policy guidelines:\n\n(1) Overall direction.

The department shall report to the transportation committees of the legislature when average transit speeds in the two lanes that are for high occupancy vehicle travel fall below forty-five miles per hour at least ten percent of the time during peak hours;(iii) A work group convened by the mayor and city council of the city of Seattle to include sound transit, King county metro, the Seattle department of transportation, the department, the University of Washington, and other persons or organizations as designated by the mayor or city council to study and make recommendations of alternative connections for transit, including bus routes and high capacity transit, to the university link light rail line. The work group must consider such techniques as grade separation, additional stations, and pedestrian lids to effect these connections. The recommendations must be alternatives to the transit connections identified in the supplemental draft environmental impact statement for the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program released in January 2010, and must meet the requirements under *RCW 47.01.408, including accommodating effective connections for transit. The recommendations must be within the scope of the supplemental draft environmental impact statement. For the purposes of this section, \"effective connections for transit\" means a connection that connects transit stops, including high capacity transit stops, that serve the state route number 520/Montlake interchange vicinity to the university link light rail line, with a connection distance of less than one thousand two hundred feet between the stops and the light rail station. The city of Seattle shall submit the recommendations by October 1, 2010, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature. However, if the city of Seattle does not convene the work group required under this subsection before July 1, 2010, or does not submit recommendations to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature by October 1, 2010, the department must convene the work group required under this subsection and meet all the requirements of this subsection that are described as requirements of the city of Seattle by November 30, 2010;(iv) A work group convened by the department to include sound transit and King county metro to study and make recommendations regarding options for planning and financing high capacity transit through the state route number 520 corridor. The department shall submit the recommendations by January 1, 2011, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature;(v) A plan to address mitigation as a result of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program at the Washington park arboretum. As part of its process, the department shall consult with the governing board of the Washington park arboretum, the Seattle city council and mayor, and the University of Washington to identify all mitigation required by state and federal law resulting from the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program's impact on the arboretum, and to develop a project mitigation plan to address these impacts. The department shall submit the mitigation plan by December 31, 2010, to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature. Wetland mitigation required by state and federal law as a result of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program's impacts on the arboretum must, to the greatest extent practicable, include on-site wetland mitigation at the Washington park arboretum, and must enhance the Washington park arboretum.

As a result, and to align with the efforts of Oregon state, the legislature intends to provide tolling authorization for the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project.\" [ 2023 c 377 s 1.]\n\nContingent effective date—2023 c 377: \"Except for sections 4, 6, and 7 of this act, this act takes effect upon, and tolls may not be collected on the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project until: (1) Certification of the secretary of transportation to the governor that the department of transportation has received satisfactory evidence that a sufficient federal funding plan is in place and that sufficient state and local funds are available to complete the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project; and (2) the bistate agreement described in section 4 of this act has taken effect.\" [ 2023 c 377 s 8.]\n\nContingent effective date—2023 c 377: \"Except for sections 4, 6, and 7 of this act, this act takes effect upon, and tolls may not be collected on the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project until: (1) Certification of the secretary of transportation to the governor that the department of transportation has received satisfactory evidence that a sufficient federal funding plan is in place and that sufficient state and local funds are available to complete the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project; and (2) the bistate agreement described in section 4 of this act has taken effect.\" [ 2023 c 377 s 8.]\n\nNotice of certification and bistate agreement—2023 c 377: \"The secretary of transportation must provide notice that the governor has received certification as described under section 8(1) of this act to affected parties, the chief clerk of the house of representatives, the secretary of the senate, the office of the code reviser, and others as deemed appropriate by the secretary.
