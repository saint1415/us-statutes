If a provider fails to submit a plan of correction for approval by the department, the department may impose civil penalties as described in this subsection starting ten days after the provider received the statement of deficiency.(5) When determining the appropriate enforcement action or actions under subsection (3) of this section, the department must select actions commensurate with the seriousness of the harm or threat of harm to the persons being served by the provider. Further, the department may take enforcement actions that are more severe for violations that are uncorrected, repeated, pervasive, or which present a serious threat of harm to the health, safety, or welfare of persons served by the provider.

The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when:(a) The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and(b) The provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found. However, if upon revisiting the provider, the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement remains in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.(7) After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the date the provider notifies the department of the correction to ensure correction of the violation.
