The legislature also intends that the child support obligation should be equitably apportioned between the parents.The legislature finds that these goals will be best achieved by the adoption and use of a statewide child support schedule. Use of a statewide schedule will benefit children and their parents by:(1) Increasing the adequacy of child support orders through the use of economic data as the basis for establishing the child support schedule;(2) Increasing the equity of child support orders by providing for comparable orders in cases with similar circumstances; and(3) Reducing the adversarial nature of the proceedings by increasing voluntary settlements as a result of the greater predictability achieved by a uniform statewide child support schedule.\n\nThe legislature intends, in establishing a child support schedule, to insure [ensure] that child support orders are adequate to meet a child's basic needs and to provide additional child support commensurate with the parents' income, resources, and standard of living.

The following expenses shall be disclosed and deducted from gross monthly income to calculate net monthly income:(a) Federal and state income taxes;(b) Federal insurance contributions act deductions;(c) Mandatory pension plan payments;(d) Mandatory union or professional dues;(e) State industrial insurance premiums;(f) Court-ordered maintenance to the extent actually paid;(g) Up to five thousand dollars per year in voluntary retirement contributions actually made if the contributions show a pattern of contributions during the one-year period preceding the action establishing the child support order unless there is a determination that the contributions were made for the purpose of reducing child support; and(h) Normal business expenses and self-employment taxes for self-employed persons. Justification shall be required for any business expense deduction about which there is disagreement.Items deducted from gross income under this subsection shall not be a reason to deviate from the standard calculation.(6) Imputation of income.

A court shall not impute income to a parent who is gainfully employed on a full-time basis, unless the court finds that the parent is voluntarily underemployed and finds that the parent is purposely underemployed to reduce the parent's child support obligation. Income shall not be imputed for an unemployable parent. Income shall not be imputed to a parent to the extent the parent is unemployed or significantly underemployed due to the parent's efforts to comply with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, in the absence of records of a parent's actual earnings, the court shall impute a parent's income in the following order of priority:(i) Full-time earnings at the current rate of pay;(ii) Full-time earnings at the historical rate of pay based on reliable information, such as employment security department data;(iii) Full-time earnings at a past rate of pay where information is incomplete or sporadic;(iv) Earnings of thirty-two hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent is on or recently coming off temporary assistance for needy families or recently coming off aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits, pregnant women assistance benefits, essential needs and housing support, supplemental security income, or disability, has recently been released from incarceration, or is a recent high school graduate.

Except as specifically excluded in subsection (4) of this section, monthly gross income shall include income from any source, including:\n\n(a) Salaries;\n\n(c) Commissions;\n\n(d) Deferred compensation;\n\n(e) Overtime, except as excluded for income in subsection (4)(i) of this section;\n\n(f) Contract-related benefits;\n\n(g) Income from second jobs, except as excluded for income in subsection (4)(i) of this section;\n\n(h) Dividends;\n\n(i) Interest;\n\n(j) Trust income;\n\n(k) Severance pay;\n\n(l) Annuities;\n\n(m) Capital gains;\n\n(n) Pension retirement benefits;\n\n(o) Workers' compensation;\n\n(p) Unemployment benefits;\n\n(q) Maintenance actually received;\n\n(r) Bonuses;\n\n(s) Social security benefits;\n\n(t) Disability insurance benefits; and\n\n(u) Income from self-employment, rent, royalties, contracts, proprietorship of a business, or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation.\n\n(4) Income sources excluded from gross monthly income. The following income and resources shall be disclosed but shall not be included in gross income:\n\n(a) Income of a new spouse or new domestic partner or income of other adults in the household;\n\n(b) Child support received from other relationships;\n\n(c) Gifts and prizes;\n\n(d) Temporary assistance for needy families;\n\n(e) Supplemental security income;\n\n(f) Aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits;\n\n(g) Pregnant women assistance benefits;\n\n(h) Food stamps; and\n\n(i) Overtime or income from second jobs beyond 40 hours per week averaged over a 12-month period worked to provide for a current family's needs, to retire past relationship debts, or to retire child support debt, when the court finds the income will cease when the party has paid off his or her debts.\n\nReceipt of income and resources from temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits, and food stamps shall not be a reason to deviate from the standard calculation.\n\n(5) Determination of net income. The following expenses shall be disclosed and deducted from gross monthly income to calculate net monthly income:\n\n(a) Federal and state income taxes;\n\n(b) Federal insurance contributions act deductions;\n\n(c) Mandatory pension plan payments;\n\n(d) Mandatory union or professional dues;\n\n(e) Other mandatory state deductions, such as mandatory state insurance premiums actually paid, including for the paid family and medical leave program and long-term services and supports trust program;\n\n(f) State industrial insurance premiums;\n\n(g) Court-ordered maintenance to the extent actually paid;\n\n(h) Up to $5,000 per year in voluntary retirement contributions actually made if the contributions show a pattern of contributions during the one-year period preceding the action establishing the child support order unless there is a determination that the contributions were made for the purpose of reducing child support; and\n\n(i) Normal business expenses and self-employment taxes for self-employed persons. Justification shall be required for any business expense deduction about which there is disagreement.\n\nItems deducted from gross income under this subsection shall not be a reason to deviate from the standard calculation.\n\n(6) Imputation of income. The court shall impute income to a parent when the parent is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed. The court shall determine whether the parent is voluntarily underemployed or voluntarily unemployed based upon that parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, health, age, criminal record, dependency court obligations, and other employment barriers, record of seeking work, the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the parent, the prevailing earnings level in the local community, or any other relevant factors. A court shall not impute income to a parent who is gainfully employed on a full-time basis, unless the court finds that the parent is voluntarily underemployed and finds that the parent is purposely underemployed to reduce the parent's child support obligation. Income shall not be imputed for an unemployable parent. Income shall not be imputed to a parent to the extent the parent is unemployed or significantly underemployed due to the parent's efforts to comply with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.\n\n(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, in the absence of records of a parent's actual earnings, the court shall impute a parent's income in the following order of priority:\n\n(i) Full-time earnings at the current rate of pay;\n\n(ii) Full-time earnings at the historical rate of pay based on reliable information, such as employment security department data;\n\n(iii) Full-time earnings at a past rate of pay where information is incomplete or sporadic;\n\n(iv) Earnings of 32 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent is on or recently coming off temporary assistance for needy families or recently coming off aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits, pregnant women assistance benefits, essential needs and housing support, supplemental security income, or disability, has recently been released from incarceration, or is a recent high school graduate. Imputation of earnings at 32 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption;\n\n(v) Full-time earnings at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent has a recent history of minimum wage earnings, has never been employed and has no earnings history, or has no significant earnings history;\n\n(vi) Median net monthly income of year-round full-time workers as derived from the United States bureau of census, current population reports, or such replacement report as published by the bureau of census.\n\n(b) When a parent is currently enrolled in high school full-time, the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances of both parents when determining whether each parent is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed. If a parent who is currently enrolled in high school is determined to be voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed, the court shall impute income at earnings of 20 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where that parent resides. Imputation of earnings at 20 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption.\n\n[ 2025 c 272 s 2; 2020 c 227 s 2; 2011 1st sp.s. c 36 s 14; 2010 1st sp.s. c 8 s 14; 2009 c 84 s 3; 2008 c 6 s 1038; 1997 c 59 s 4; 1993 c 358 s 4; 1991 sp.s. c 28 s 5.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 272 ss 1-3 and 14: See note following RCW 26.19.065.\n\nEffective date—2025 c 272 ss 1-3 and 14: See note following RCW 26.19.065.\n\nRule-making authority—2025 c 272: See note following RCW 26.09.345.\n\nRule-making authority—2025 c 272: See note following RCW 26.09.345.\n\nFindings—Intent—2020 c 227: See note following RCW 26.09.320.\n\nFindings—Intent—2020 c 227: See note following RCW 26.09.320.\n\nRule-making authority—2020 c 227: See RCW 26.09.916.\n\nRule-making authority—2020 c 227: See RCW 26.09.916.\n\nFindings—Intent—2011 1st sp.s. c 36: See RCW 74.62.005.\n\nFindings—Intent—2011 1st sp.s. c 36: See RCW 74.62.005.\n\nEffective date—2011 1st sp.s. c 36: See note following RCW 74.62.005.\n\nEffective date—2011 1st sp.s. c 36: See note following RCW 74.62.005.\n\nFindings—Intent—Short title—Effective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 8: See notes following RCW 74.04.225.\n\nFindings—Intent—Short title—Effective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 8: See notes following RCW 74.04.225.\n\nEffective date—2009 c 84: See note following RCW 26.19.020.\n\nEffective date—2009 c 84: See note following RCW 26.19.020.\n\nPart headings not law—Severability—2008 c 6: See RCW 26.60.900 and 26.60.901.\n\nPart headings not law—Severability—2008 c 6: See RCW 26.60.900 and 26.60.901.\n\nSeverability—Effective date—Captions not law—1991 sp.s. c 28: See notes following RCW 26.09.100.\n\nSeverability—Effective date—Captions not law—1991 sp.s. c 28: See notes following RCW 26.09.100.",

The court may deviate from the standard calculation after consideration of the following:(i) Income of a new spouse or new domestic partner if the parent who is married to the new spouse or in a partnership with a new domestic partner is asking for a deviation based on any other reason. Income of a new spouse or new domestic partner is not, by itself, a sufficient reason for deviation;(ii) Income of other adults in the household if the parent who is living with the other adult is asking for a deviation based on any other reason. Income of the other adults in the household is not, by itself, a sufficient reason for deviation;(iii) Child support actually received from other relationships;(iv) Gifts;(v) Prizes;(vi) Possession of wealth, including but not limited to savings, investments, real estate holdings and business interests, vehicles, boats, pensions, bank accounts, insurance plans, or other assets;(vii) Extraordinary income of a child;(viii) Tax planning considerations. A deviation for tax planning may be granted only if the child would not receive a lesser economic benefit due to the tax planning; or(ix) Income that has been excluded under *RCW 26.19.071(4)(h) if the person earning that income asks for a deviation for any other reason.(b) Nonrecurring income. The court may deviate from the standard calculation based on a finding that a particular source of income included in the calculation of the basic support obligation is not a recurring source of income. Depending on the circumstances, nonrecurring income may include overtime, contract-related benefits, bonuses, or income from second jobs. Deviations for nonrecurring income shall be based on a review of the nonrecurring income received in the previous two calendar years.(c) Debt and high expenses. The court may deviate from the standard calculation after consideration of the following expenses:(i) Extraordinary debt not voluntarily incurred;(ii) A significant disparity in the living costs of the parents due to conditions beyond their control;(iii) Special needs of disabled children;(iv) Special medical, educational, or psychological needs of the children; or(v) Costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the parents in compliance with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.(d) Residential schedule. The court may deviate from the standard calculation if the child spends a significant amount of time with the parent who is obligated to make a support transfer payment. The court may not deviate on that basis if the deviation will result in insufficient funds in the household receiving the support to meet the basic needs of the child or if the child is receiving temporary assistance for needy families. When determining the amount of the deviation, the court shall consider evidence concerning the increased expenses to a parent making support transfer payments resulting from the significant amount of time spent with that parent and shall consider the decreased expenses, if any, to the party receiving the support resulting from the significant amount of time the child spends with the parent making the support transfer payment.(e) Children from other relationships. The court may deviate from the standard calculation when either or both of the parents before the court have children from other relationships to whom the parent owes a duty of support.(i) The child support schedule shall be applied to the mother, father, and children of the family before the court to determine the presumptive amount of support.(ii) Children from other relationships shall not be counted in the number of children for purposes of determining the basic support obligation and the standard calculation.(iii) When considering a deviation from the standard calculation for children from other relationships, the court may consider only other children to whom the parent owes a duty of support. The court may consider court-ordered payments of child support for children from other relationships only to the extent that the support is actually paid.(iv) When the court has determined that either or both parents have children from other relationships, deviations under this section shall be based on consideration of the total circumstances of both households.

Unless specific reasons for deviation are set forth in the written findings of fact and are supported by the evidence, the court shall order each parent to pay the amount of support determined by using the standard calculation.(3) The court shall enter findings that specify reasons for any deviation or any denial of a party's request for any deviation from the standard calculation made by the court. The court shall not consider reasons for deviation until the court determines the standard calculation for each parent.(4) When reasons exist for deviation, the court shall exercise discretion in considering the extent to which the factors would affect the support obligation.(5) Agreement of the parties is not by itself adequate reason for any deviations from the standard calculation.\n\n(1) Reasons for deviation from the standard calculation include but are not limited to the following:\n\n(a) Sources of income and tax planning. The court may deviate from the standard calculation after consideration of the following:\n\n(i) Income of a new spouse or new domestic partner if the parent who is married to the new spouse or in a partnership with a new domestic partner is asking for a deviation based on any other reason. Income of a new spouse or new domestic partner is not, by itself, a sufficient reason for deviation;\n\n(ii) Income of other adults in the household if the parent who is living with the other adult is asking for a deviation based on any other reason.

Depending on the circumstances, nonrecurring income may include overtime, contract-related benefits, bonuses, or income from second jobs. Deviations for nonrecurring income shall be based on a review of the nonrecurring income received in the previous two calendar years.\n\n(c) Debt and high expenses. The court may deviate from the standard calculation after consideration of the following expenses:\n\n(i) Extraordinary debt not voluntarily incurred;\n\n(ii) A significant disparity in the living costs of the parents due to conditions beyond their control;\n\n(iii) Special needs of disabled children;\n\n(iv) Special medical, educational, or psychological needs of the children; or\n\n(v) Costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the parents in compliance with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.\n\n(d) Residential schedule.

The court shall exercise its discretion when determining whether and for how long to award postsecondary educational support based upon consideration of factors that include but are not limited to the following: Age of the child; the child's needs; the expectations of the parties for their children when the parents were together; the child's prospects, desires, aptitudes, abilities or disabilities; the nature of the postsecondary education sought; and the parents' level of education, standard of living, and current and future resources. Also to be considered are the amount and type of support that the child would have been afforded if the parents had stayed together.(3) The child must enroll in an accredited academic or vocational school, must be actively pursuing a course of study commensurate with the child's vocational goals, and must be in good academic standing as defined by the institution. The court-ordered postsecondary educational support shall be automatically suspended during the period or periods the child fails to comply with these conditions.(4) The child shall also make available all academic records and grades to both parents as a condition of receiving postsecondary educational support. Each parent shall have full and equal access to the postsecondary education records as provided in RCW 26.09.225.(5) The court shall not order the payment of postsecondary educational expenses beyond the child's twenty-third birthday, except for exceptional circumstances, such as mental, physical, or emotional disabilities.(6) The court shall direct that either or both parents' payments for postsecondary educational expenses be made directly to the educational institution if feasible. If direct payments are not feasible, then the court in its discretion may order that either or both parents' payments be made directly to the child if the child does not reside with either parent. If the child resides with one of the parents the court may direct that the parent making the support transfer payments make the payments to the child or to the parent who has been receiving the support transfer payments.\n\n(1) The child support schedule shall be advisory and not mandatory for postsecondary educational support.\n\n(2) When considering whether to order support for postsecondary educational expenses, the court shall determine whether the child is in fact dependent and is relying upon the parents for the reasonable necessities of life.
