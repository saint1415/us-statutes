Compliance with the right is the sole available remedy. The court shall expedite consideration of a petition filed under this subsection.\n\n[ 2025 c 375 s 7; 2024 c 297 s 10; 2023 c 197 s 11; 2022 c 229 s 1; 2009 c 138 s 5; 2008 c 286 s 16; 2004 c 120 s 8; 1999 c 323 s 2; 1997 c 343 s 1; 1993 c 350 s 6; 1985 c 443 s 3; 1981 c 145 s 3.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 375: See note following RCW 49.76.030.\n\nEffective date—2025 c 375: See note following RCW 49.76.030.\n\nEffective date—2024 c 297: See note following RCW 7.68.127.\n\nEffective date—2024 c 297: See note following RCW 7.68.127.\n\nEffective date—2008 c 286: See RCW 49.76.900.\n\nEffective date—2008 c 286: See RCW 49.76.900.\n\nEffective date—2004 c 120: See note following RCW 13.40.010.\n\nEffective date—2004 c 120: See note following RCW 13.40.010.\n\nIntent—1999 c 323: See note following RCW 9.94A.885.\n\nIntent—1999 c 323: See note following RCW 9.94A.885.\n\nFindings—1993 c 350: See note following RCW 7.69.020.\n\nFindings—1993 c 350: See note following RCW 7.69.020.\n\nSeverability—Effective date—1985 c 443: See notes following RCW 7.69.010.\n\nSeverability—Effective date—1985 c 443: See notes following RCW 7.69.010.\n\nChild victims and witnesses, additional rights: Chapter 7.69A RCW.\n\nChild victims and witnesses, additional rights: Chapter 7.69A RCW.",
