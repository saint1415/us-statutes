The legislature finds that Washington has been using the valid court order exception of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act, a loophole in federal law allowing judges to detain status offenders for disobeying court orders, more than any other state in the country. The legislature finds that use of the valid court order exception to detain youth for acts like truancy, breaking curfew, or running away from home is counterproductive and may worsen outcomes for at-risk youth.(2) The legislature further finds that these youth should not be confined with or treated with the same interventions as criminal offenders. The legislature also finds that studies show a disproportionality in race, gender, and socioeconomic status of youth referred to courts or detained, or both. Likewise, the legislature finds that community-based interventions are more effective at addressing underlying causes of status offenses than detention and can reduce court caseloads and lower system costs. As a result, it is the intent of the legislature to strengthen and fund community-based programs that are culturally relevant and focus on addressing disproportionality of youth of color, especially at-risk youth.(3) The legislature finds that appropriate interventions may include secure, semi-secure, and nonsecure out-of-home placement options, community-based mentoring, counseling, family reconciliation, behavioral health services, and other services designed to support youth and families in crisis and to prevent the need for out-of-home placement. The legislature recognizes that in certain circumstances, a court may find pursuant to this act that less restrictive alternatives to secure confinement are not available or appropriate and that clear, cogent, and convincing evidence requires commitment to a secure residential program with intensive wraparound services. The legislature intends to expand the availability of such interventions statewide by July 1, 2023.\" [ 2019 c 312 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2019 c 312: \"(1) The legislature finds that it is a goal of our state to divert juveniles who have committed status offenses, behaviors that are prohibited under law only because of an individual's status as a minor, away from the juvenile justice system because a stay in detention is a predictive factor for future criminal justice system involvement. The legislature finds that Washington has been using the valid court order exception of the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act, a loophole in federal law allowing judges to detain status offenders for disobeying court orders, more than any other state in the country. The legislature finds that use of the valid court order exception to detain youth for acts like truancy, breaking curfew, or running away from home is counterproductive and may worsen outcomes for at-risk youth.\n\n(2) The legislature further finds that these youth should not be confined with or treated with the same interventions as criminal offenders. The legislature also finds that studies show a disproportionality in race, gender, and socioeconomic status of youth referred to courts or detained, or both. Likewise, the legislature finds that community-based interventions are more effective at addressing underlying causes of status offenses than detention and can reduce court caseloads and lower system costs. As a result, it is the intent of the legislature to strengthen and fund community-based programs that are culturally relevant and focus on addressing disproportionality of youth of color, especially at-risk youth.\n\n(3) The legislature finds that appropriate interventions may include secure, semi-secure, and nonsecure out-of-home placement options, community-based mentoring, counseling, family reconciliation, behavioral health services, and other services designed to support youth and families in crisis and to prevent the need for out-of-home placement. The legislature recognizes that in certain circumstances, a court may find pursuant to this act that less restrictive alternatives to secure confinement are not available or appropriate and that clear, cogent, and convincing evidence requires commitment to a secure residential program with intensive wraparound services. The legislature intends to expand the availability of such interventions statewide by July 1, 2023.\" [ 2019 c 312 s 1.]",
