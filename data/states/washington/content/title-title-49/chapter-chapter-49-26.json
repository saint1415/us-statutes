Asbestos workers must have access to certified asbestos supervisors throughout the duration of the project.\n\n(2) The department shall require persons undertaking asbestos projects to provide written notice to the department before the commencement of the project except as provided in RCW 49.26.125. The notice shall include a written description containing such information as the department requires by rule. The department may by rule allow a person to report multiple projects at one site in one report.
