A cost-reimbursement agreement may be initiated under this section if the applicant agrees to pay for, or as part of a cooperative effort agrees to pay for, the cost of processing his or her application and all other applications from the same source of supply which must be acted upon before the applicant's request because they were filed prior to the date of when the applicant filed.(b) The requirement to pay for the cost of other applications under (a) of this subsection does not apply to an application for a new appropriation that would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants for new appropriations from the same source of supply.(c) The requirement to pay for the cost of processing other applications under (a) of this subsection does not apply to an application for a change, transfer, or other amendment that would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants for changes or transfers from the same source of supply.(d) In determining whether an application would not diminish the water available to earlier pending applicants, the department shall consider any water impoundment or other water resource management mitigation technique proposed by the applicant under RCW 90.03.255 or 90.44.055.(e) The department may enter into cost-reimbursement agreements provided resources are available and shall use the process established under RCW 43.21A.690 for entering into cost-reimbursement agreements. The department's share of work related to a cost-reimbursement application, such as final certificate approval, must be prioritized within the framework of other water right processing needs and as determined by agency rule.(f) Each individual applicant is responsible for his or her own appeal costs that may result from a water right decision made by the department under this section. In the event that the department's approval of an application under this section is appealed under chapter 43.21B RCW by a third party, the applicant for the water right in question must reimburse the department for the cost of defending the decision before the pollution control hearings board unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant and the department. If an applicant appeals either an approval or a denial made by the department under this section, the applicant is responsible only for its own appeal costs.(2) In pursuing a cost-reimbursement project, the department must determine the source of water proposed to be diverted or withdrawn from, including the boundaries of the area that delimits the source. The department must determine if any other water right permit applications are pending from the same source. A water source may include surface water only, groundwater only, or surface and groundwater together if the department finds they are hydraulically connected. The department shall consider technical information submitted by the applicant in making its determinations under this subsection. The department may recover from a cost-reimbursement applicant its own costs in making the same source determination under this subsection.(3) Upon request of the applicant seeking cost-reimbursement processing, the department may elect to initiate a coordinated cost-reimbursement process. To initiate this process, the department must notify in writing all persons who have pending applications on file for a new appropriation, change, transfer, or amendment of a water right from that water source. A water source may include surface water only, groundwater only, or surface and groundwater together if the department determines that they are hydraulically connected. The notice must be posted on the department's website and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where affected properties are located. The notice must also be made individually by way of mail to:(a) Inform those applicants that cost-reimbursement processing of applications within the described water source is being initiated;(b) Provide to individual applicants the criteria under which the applications will be examined and determined;(c) Provide to individual applicants the estimated cost for having an application processed on a cost-reimbursement basis;(d) Provide an estimate of how long the cost-reimbursement process will take before an application is approved or denied; and(e) Provide at least sixty days for the applicants to respond in writing regarding the applicant's decision to participate in the cost-reimbursement process.(4) The applicant initiating the cost-reimbursement request must pay for the cost of the determination under subsections (2) and (3) of this section and other costs necessary for the initial phase of cost-reimbursement processing. The cost for each applicant for conducting processing under a coordinated cost-reimbursement agreement must be based primarily on the proportionate quantity of water requested by each applicant. The cost may be adjusted if it appears that an application will require a disproportionately greater amount of time and effort to process due to its complexity.(5)(a) Only the department may approve or deny a water right application processed under this section, and such a final decision remains solely the responsibility and function of the department. The department retains full authority to amend, refuse, or approve any work product provided by any consultant under this section. The department may recover its costs related to: (i) The review of a consultant to ensure that no conflict of interest exists; (ii) the management of consultant contracts and cost-reimbursement agreements; and (iii) the review of work products provided by participating consultants.(b) For any cost-reimbursement process initiated under subsection (1) of this section, the applicant may, after consulting with the department, select a prequalified consultant listed by the department under subsection (7) of this section or may be assigned such a prequalified consultant by the department.(c) For any coordinated cost-reimbursement process initiated under subsection (3) of this section, the applicant may, after consulting with the department, select a prequalified consultant listed by the department under subsection (7) of this section or may be assigned a prequalified consultant by the department.(d) In lieu of having one or more of the work products performed by a prequalified consultant listed under subsection (7) of this section, the department may, at its discretion, recognize specific work completed by an applicant or an applicant's consultant prior to the initiation of cost-reimbursement processing. The department may also, at its discretion, authorize the use of such a consultant to perform a specific scope of the work that would otherwise be assigned to prequalified consultants listed under subsection (7) of this section.(e) At any point during the cost-reimbursement process, the department may request or accept technical information, data, and analysis from the applicant or the applicant's consultant to support the cost-reimbursement process or the department's decision on the application.(6) The department is authorized to adopt rules or guidance providing minimum qualifications and standards for any consultant's submission of work products under this section, including standards for submission of technical information, scientific analysis, work product documentation, review for conflict of interest, and report presentation that such a consultant must meet.(7) The department must provide notice to potential consultants of the opportunity to be considered for inclusion on the list of cost-reimbursement consultants to whom work assignments will be made. The department must competitively select an appropriate number of consultants who are qualified by training and experience to investigate and make recommendations on the disposition of water right applications. The prequalified consultant list must be renewed at least every six years, though the department may add qualified cost-reimbursement consultants to the list at any time. The department must enter a master contract with each consultant selected and thereafter make work assignments based on availability and qualifications.(8) The department may remove any consultant from the consultant list for poor performance, malfeasance, or excessive complaints from cost-reimbursement participants. The department may interview any cost-reimbursement consultant to determine whether the person is qualified for this work, and must spot-check the work of consultants to ensure that the public is being competently served.(9) When a prequalified cost-reimbursement consultant from the department's list described in subsection (7) of this section is assigned or selected to investigate an application or set of applications, the consultant must document its findings and recommended disposition in the form of written draft technical reports and preliminary draft reports of examination. Within two weeks of the department receiving draft technical reports and preliminary draft reports of examination, the department shall provide the applicant such documents for review and comment prior to their completion by the consultant. The department shall consider such comments by the applicant prior to the department's issuance of a draft report of examination. The department may modify the preliminary draft reports of examination submitted by the consultant. The department's decision on a permit application is final unless it is appealed to the pollution control hearings board under chapter 43.21B RCW.(10) If an applicant elects not to participate in a cost-reimbursement process, the application remains on file with the department, retains its priority date, and may be processed under regular processing, priority processing, expedited processing, coordinated cost-reimbursement processing, cost-reimbursement processing, or through conservancy board processing as authorized under chapter 90.80 RCW.\n\n(1)(a) Any applicant for a new withdrawal or a change, transfer, or amendment of a water right pending before the department may initiate a cost-reimbursement agreement with the department to provide expedited review of the application.

The department may diminish the right represented by such a certificate if the certificate was obtained through a misrepresentation on the part of the applicant or permit holder, but only to the extent of the misrepresentation. The authority provided by this subsection does not include revoking, diminishing, or adjusting a certificate based on any change in policy regarding the issuance of such certificates that has occurred since the certificate was issued. This subsection may not be construed as providing any authority to the department to revoke, diminish, or adjust any other water right.\n\n(3) This subsection applies to the water right represented by a water right certificate issued prior to September 9, 2003, for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015 where the certificate was issued based on an administrative policy for issuing such certificates once works for diverting or withdrawing and distributing water for municipal supply purposes were constructed rather than after the water had been placed to actual beneficial use. Such a water right is a right in good standing.\n\n(4) After September 9, 2003, the department must issue a new certificate under subsection (1) of this section for a water right represented by a water right permit only for the perfected portion of a water right as demonstrated through actual beneficial use of water.\n\n[ 2003 1st sp.s. c 5 s 6; 1987 c 109 s 89; 1929 c 122 s 5; 1917 c 117 s 34; RRS s 7386.

Given the continued growth in the most populous areas of the state, the increased complexity of public water supply management, and the trend toward regional planning and regional solutions to resource issues, interconnections of public water systems through interties provide a valuable tool to ensure reliable public water supplies for the citizens of the state. Public water systems have been encouraged in the past to utilize interties to achieve public health and resource management objectives. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to recognize interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, and to have associated water rights modified by the department of ecology to reflect current use of water through those interties, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The legislature further finds it in the public interest to develop a coordinated process to review proposals for interties commencing use after January 1, 1991.(2) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:(a) \"Interties\" are interconnections between public water systems permitting exchange or delivery of water between those systems for other than emergency supply purposes, where such exchange or delivery is within established instantaneous and annual withdrawal rates specified in the systems' existing water right permits or certificates, or contained in claims filed pursuant to chapter 90.14 RCW, and which results in better management of public water supply consistent with existing rights and obligations. Interties include interconnections between public water systems permitting exchange or delivery of water to serve as primary or secondary sources of supply, but do not include development of new sources of supply to meet future demand.(b) \"Service area\" is the area designated in a water system plan or a coordinated water system plan pursuant to chapter 43.20 or 70A.100 RCW respectively. When a public water system does not have a designated service area subject to the approval process of those chapters, the service area shall be the designated place of use contained in the water right permit or certificate, or contained in the claim filed pursuant to chapter 90.14 RCW.(3) Public water systems with interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, or that have received written approval from the department of health prior to that date, shall file written notice of those interties with the department of health and the department of ecology. The notice may be incorporated into the public water system's five-year update of its water system plan, but shall be filed no later than June 30, 1996. The notice shall identify the location of the intertie; the dates of its first use; the purpose, capacity, and current use; the intertie agreement of the parties and the service areas assigned; and other information reasonably necessary to modify the water right permit. Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100, for public water systems with interties existing and in use as of January 1, 1991, the department of ecology, upon receipt of notice meeting the requirements of this subsection, shall, as soon as practicable, modify the place of use descriptions in the water right permits, certificates, or claims to reflect the actual use through such interties, provided that the place of use is within service area designations established in a water system plan approved pursuant to chapter 43.20 RCW, or a coordinated water system plan approved pursuant to chapter 70A.100 RCW, and further provided that the water used is within the instantaneous and annual withdrawal rates specified in the water right permit and that no outstanding complaints of impairment to existing water rights have been filed with the department of ecology prior to September 1, 1991. Where such complaints of impairment have been received, the department of ecology shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve them in a timely manner through agreement of the parties or through available administrative remedies.(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100, exchange or delivery of water through interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall be permitted when the intertie improves overall system reliability, enhances the manageability of the systems, provides opportunities for conjunctive use, or delays or avoids the need to develop new water sources, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, provided that each public water system's water use shall not exceed the instantaneous or annual withdrawal rate specified in its water right authorization, shall not adversely affect existing water rights, and shall not be inconsistent with state-approved plans such as water system plans or other plans which include specific proposals for construction of interties. Interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall not be inconsistent with regional water resource plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.54 RCW.(5) For public water systems subject to the approval process of chapter 43.20 RCW or chapter 70A.100 RCW, proposals for interties commencing use after January 1, 1991, shall be incorporated into water system plans pursuant to chapter 43.20 RCW or coordinated water system plans pursuant to chapter 70A.100 RCW and submitted to the department of health and the department of ecology for review and approval as provided for in subsections (5) through (9) of this section. The plan shall state how the proposed intertie will improve overall system reliability, enhance the manageability of the systems, provide opportunities for conjunctive use, or delay or avoid the need to develop new water sources.(6) The department of health shall be responsible for review and approval of proposals for new interties. In its review the department of health shall determine whether the intertie satisfies the criteria of subsection (4) of this section, with the exception of water rights considerations, which are the responsibility of the department of ecology, and shall determine whether the intertie is necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply.(7) If the intertie is determined by the department of health to be necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply, the public water system shall amend its water system plan as required and shall file an application with the department of ecology to change its existing water right to reflect the proposed use of the water as described in the approved water system plan. The department of ecology shall process the application for change pursuant to RCW 90.03.380 or 90.44.100 as appropriate, except that, notwithstanding the requirements of those sections regarding notice and protest periods, applicants shall be required to publish notice one time, and the comment period shall be fifteen days from the date of publication of the notice. Within sixty days of receiving the application, the department of ecology shall issue findings and advise the department of health if existing water rights are determined to be adversely affected. If no determination is provided by the department of ecology within the sixty-day period, the department of health shall proceed as if existing rights are not adversely affected by the proposed intertie. The department of ecology may obtain an extension of the sixty-day period by submitting written notice to the department of health and to the applicant indicating a definite date by which its determination will be made. No additional extensions shall be granted, and in no event shall the total review period for the department of ecology exceed one hundred eighty days.(8) If the department of health determines the proposed intertie appears to meet the requirements of subsection (4) of this section but is not necessary to address emergent public health or safety concerns associated with public water supply, the department of health shall instruct the applicant to submit to the department of ecology an application for change to the underlying water right or claim as necessary to reflect the new place of use. The department of ecology shall consider the applications pursuant to the provisions of RCW 90.03.380 and 90.44.100 as appropriate. If in its review of proposed interties and associated water rights the department of ecology determines that additional information is required to act on the application, the department may request applicants to provide information necessary for its decision, consistent with agency rules and written guidelines. Parties disagreeing with the decision of the department of ecology on the application for change in place of use may appeal the decision to the pollution control hearings board.(9) The department of health may approve plans containing intertie proposals prior to the department of ecology's decision on the water right application for change in place of use. However, notwithstanding such approval, construction work on the intertie shall not begin until the department of ecology issues the appropriate water right document to the applicant consistent with the approved plan.\n\n(1) The legislature recognizes the value of interties for improving the reliability of public water systems, enhancing their management, and more efficiently utilizing the increasingly limited resource.
