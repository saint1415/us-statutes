The pace of integrated plan implementation over the long term depends upon adequate funding and is subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this purpose;(g) The current real estate market provides opportunities to acquire community forestlands that are useful for protecting and enhancing watershed function at affordable prices;(h) Although significant benefits are anticipated to result from the implementation of the Yakima integrated plan, in light of its substantial costs and the state's limited capacity to absorb them within existing resources, there is a need to identify and evaluate potential new state and local revenue sources to assist in paying the state and local share of implementation costs.(2) It is the purpose of this chapter, consistent with these findings, to:(a) Improve the ability of the state to work with the United States and various water users of the Yakima river basin in a program designed to satisfy both existing rights, and other presently unmet as well as future needs of the basin;(b) Establish legislative intent to promote timely and effective implementation of the integrated plan in the Yakima river basin, and to promote the aggressive pursuit of water supply solutions that provide concurrent benefits to both instream and out-of-stream uses in the Yakima river basin as rapidly as possible; and(c) Take advantage of affordable real estate prices to acquire community forestlands that are useful for protecting and enhancing watershed function.(3) The provisions of this chapter apply only to waters of the Yakima river basin.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that:\n\n(a) Under present physical conditions in the Yakima river basin there is an insufficient supply of ground and surface water to satisfy the present needs of the basin, and that the general health, welfare, and safety of the people of the Yakima river basin depend upon the conservation, management, development, and optimum use of all the basin's water resources;\n\n(b) The future competition for water among municipal, domestic, industrial, agricultural, and instream water interests in the Yakima river basin will be intensified by continued population growth, and by changes in climate and precipitation anticipated to reduce the basin's snow pack and thereby reduce the total water supply available to existing water users, instream flows, and carryover storage;\n\n(c) To address the challenges described in this subsection, congress has enacted several bills to promote Yakima river basin water enhancement, each of which was urged for enactment by this state, the United States has completed a study of ways to provide needed waters through improvements of the federal water project presently existing in the Yakima river basin, and federal, tribal, state, and local cooperators have developed an integrated water resource management plan for improving water supply, habitat, and streamflow conditions in the Yakima river basin;\n\n(d) As part of the Yakima river basin water enhancement project, the United States department of the interior's bureau of reclamation is now seeking funding to support implementation of the integrated water resource management plan for the Yakima river basin, which was jointly prepared by the Washington state department of ecology and the United States bureau of reclamation and published in a final programmatic environmental impact statement in March 2012;\n\n(e) The interests of the state will be served by developing programs, in cooperation with the United States and the various water users in the basin, that increase the overall ability to manage basin waters in order to better satisfy both present and future needs for water in the Yakima river basin;\n\n(f) The interests of the state will also be served through coordination of federal and state policies and procedures in order to develop and implement projects within the framework of the integrated water resource management plan for the Yakima river basin.

The purchase must be reviewed and approved by the board of natural resources. In its evaluation of this acquisition pursuant to RCW 79.155.040(3), the board is relieved from considering the criteria for identifying and prioritizing land set forth in RCW 79.155.050. Once purchased, the land must be managed by the department of natural resources in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife. Any investment in the land purchase with funds belonging to the common school trust constitutes a loan from the irreducible principal of the common school trust and may only be made if first determined to be a prudent investment by the board of natural resources. An annual interest payment on the loan of nine percent must be paid, with six percent deposited into the common school construction account and three percent deposited into the real property replacement account. Interest begins to accrue on the date the land purchase is completed and is due and payable July 1st following the completion of the state fiscal year. The principal of the loan must be repaid in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section.(2) The land purchased under this authority must be managed under a transitional postacquisition management plan during the period between the date of purchase and the water supply facility permit and funding milestone or until June 30, 2035, whichever is sooner. The plan must be consistent with RCW 79.155.080(1), provided that the lands acquired as community forest trust lands are not required to generate financial support for their management as would otherwise be required by RCW 79.155.020(2), 79.155.030(2)(d), and 79.155.080(3), and provided further that the authority granted to the department to divest of the property under RCW 79.155.080(4) does not apply to these lands. The department of natural resources must develop the transitional postacquisition management plan in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife.(a) The plan must ensure that the land is managed in a manner that is consistent with the Yakima basin integrated plan principles for forestland acquisitions, including the following:(i) To protect and enhance the water supply and protect the watershed;(ii) To maintain working lands for forestry and grazing while protecting key watershed functions and aquatic habitat;(iii) To maintain and where possible expand recreational opportunities consistent with watershed protection, for activities such as hiking, fishing, hunting, horseback riding, camping, birding, and snowmobiling;(iv) To conserve and restore vital habitat for fish, including steelhead, spring chinook, and bull trout, and wildlife, including deer, elk, large predators, and spotted owls; and(v) To support a strong community partnership, in which the Yakama Nation, residents, business owners, local governments, conservation groups, and others provide advice about ongoing land management.(b) The department of natural resources, in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife, must establish the Teanaway community forest advisory committee that includes representatives from the department of ecology, the local community, land conservation organizations, the Yakama Nation, the Kittitas county commission, and local agricultural interests.(c) By June 30, 2015, the department of natural resources must complete the transitional postacquisition management plan with a public process that involves interested stakeholders, particularly residents from Kittitas county, friends of the Teanaway, back country horsemen, off-road vehicle and snowmobile users, a representative from Kittitas field and stream, hikers and wildlife watchers, and ranchers who graze cattle.(3) After the water supply facility permit and funding milestone or June 30, 2035, whichever is sooner, the land must be disposed of in the following manner:(a) If the water supply facility permit and funding milestone conditions have been met, the land remains in the community forest trust and the transitional postacquisition management plan must be converted to a permanent postacquisition management plan with whatever updates and amendments are periodically adopted. Under these conditions, the remaining principal of any investment in the land purchased with funds belonging to the common school trust must be repaid to the real property replacement account.(b) If the water supply facility permit and funding milestone conditions have not been met, the board of natural resources must decide between the following dispositions of the land:(i) Deposit of the entire amount of land purchased into the ownership of the common school trust for management or disposition for the benefit of the common schools; or(ii) Disposition under the terms of (a) of this subsection.\n\n(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department of natural resources is authorized to purchase land to be held in the community forest trust under RCW 79.155.040 to serve the purposes of the community forest trust including the protection of Yakima river basin functioning, without complying with the requirements of RCW 79.155.030(1), 79.155.060, or 79.155.070, relating to the identification, prioritization, local commitment, and financial contribution normally prerequisite to nominating and acquiring community forest trust lands.
