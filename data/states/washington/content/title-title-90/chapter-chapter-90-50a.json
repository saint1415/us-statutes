In its submittal to the office of financial management, the department may:\n\n(a) Find that the projected administration charge income is inadequate to fund the cost of administering the program, and that the rate of the charge must be increased. However, the administration charge may never exceed one percent on the declining principal loan balance;\n\n(b) Find that the projected administration charge income exceeds what is needed to fund the cost of administering the program, and that the rate of the charge must be decreased;\n\n(c) Find that there is an excess balance in the revolving administration account, and that the excess must be transferred to the water pollution control revolving fund to be used for loans; or\n\n(d) Find that there is no need for any rate adjustments or balance transfers.\n\n(8) At the point where the water pollution control revolving administration account adequately covers the program administration costs, the department may no longer use the federal administration allowance. If a federal capitalization grant is awarded after that point, all federal capitalization dollars must be used for making loans.\n\n(9) By December 1, 2018, the department must submit to the appropriate legislative fiscal committees a report on implementation of the administration charge, including information on: The amount of income the administration charge has produced since its inception; the uses and adequacy of the income for administrative costs; any excess balances that have been transferred to the water pollution control revolving fund; and any additional sources that the department is using for program administration.\n\n(10) The legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the water pollution control revolving administration account to the water pollution control revolving fund.\n\n[ 2022 c 157 s 22; 2021 c 334 s 1000; 2019 c 415 s 992; 2013 c 96 s 2.]\n\nConflict with federal requirements—Effective date—2021 c 334: See notes following RCW 43.79.555.\n\nConflict with federal requirements—Effective date—2021 c 334: See notes following RCW 43.79.555.\n\nEffective date—2019 c 415: See note following RCW 28B.20.476.\n\nEffective date—2019 c 415: See note following RCW 28B.20.476.",
