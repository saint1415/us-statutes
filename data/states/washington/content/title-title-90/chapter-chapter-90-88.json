The legislature finds that Hood Canal is a rich source of recreation, fishing, aquaculture, and aesthetic enjoyment for the citizens of this state. The legislature also finds that Hood Canal has great cultural significance for the tribes in the Hood Canal area. The legislature therefore recognizes Hood Canal's substantial environmental, cultural, economic, recreational, and aesthetic importance in this state.(2) The legislature finds that Hood Canal is a marine water of the state at significant risk. The legislature finds that Hood Canal has a \"dead zone\" related to low-dissolved oxygen concentrations, a condition that has recurred for many years. The legislature also finds that this problem and various contributors to the problem were documented in the May 2004 Preliminary Assessment and Corrective Action Plan published by the state agency known as the Puget Sound action team and the Hood Canal coordinating council.(3) The legislature further finds that significant research, monitoring, and study efforts are currently occurring regarding Hood Canal's low-dissolved oxygen concentrations. The legislature also finds numerous public, private, and community organizations are working to provide public education and identify potential solutions. The legislature recognizes that, while some information and research is now available and some potential solutions have been identified, more research and analysis is needed to fully develop a program to address Hood Canal's low-dissolved oxygen concentrations.(4) The legislature finds a need exists for the state to take action to address Hood Canal's low-dissolved oxygen concentrations. The legislature also finds establishing an aquatic rehabilitation zone for Hood Canal will serve as a statutory framework for future regulations and programs directed at recovery of this important aquatic resource.(5) The legislature therefore intends to establish an aquatic rehabilitation zone for Hood Canal as the framework to address Hood Canal's low-dissolved oxygen concentrations. The legislature also intends to incorporate provisions in the new statutory chapter creating the designation as solutions are identified regarding this problem.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that Hood Canal is a precious aquatic resource of our state.
