The legislature finds that an effective way to meet the water needs of people, farms, and fish is through strategies developed and implemented at the local watershed level. The objectives of these strategies are to supply water in sufficient quantities to satisfy the following three water resource objectives:(1) Providing sufficient water for residential, commercial, and industrial needs;(2) Providing sufficient water for productive fish populations; and(3) Providing sufficient water for productive agriculture.The legislature affirms its intent to provide continued support for watershed strategies and provides the tools in chapter 329, Laws of 2002 to assist local watersheds in meeting these objectives.\n\nThe legislature recognizes the critical importance of providing and securing sufficient water to meet the needs of people, farms, and fish.

Although water is a renewable resource, its supply and availability are becoming increasingly limited, particularly during summer and fall months and dry years when demand is greatest. Growth and prosperity have significantly increased the competition for this limited resource. Adequate water supplies are essential to meet the needs of the state's growing population and economy. At the same time instream resources and values must be preserved and protected so that future generations can continue to enjoy them.(b) All citizens of Washington share an interest in the proper stewardship of our invaluable water resources. To ensure that available water supplies are managed to best meet both instream and offstream needs, a comprehensive planning process is essential. The people of the state have the unique opportunity to work together to plan and manage our water. Through a comprehensive planning process that includes the state, Indian tribes, local governments, and interested parties, it is possible to make better use of available water supplies and achieve better management of water resources. Through comprehensive planning, conflicts among water users and interests can be reduced or resolved. It is in the best interests of the state that comprehensive water resource planning be given a high priority so that water resources and associated values can be utilized and enjoyed today and protected for tomorrow.(c) Diverse hydrologic, climatic, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions exist throughout the regions of the state.

Maximum net benefits shall constitute total benefits less costs including opportunities lost.(3) The quality of the natural environment shall be protected and, where possible, enhanced as follows:(a) Perennial rivers and streams of the state shall be retained with base flows necessary to provide for preservation of wildlife, fish, scenic, aesthetic and other environmental values, and navigational values. Lakes and ponds shall be retained substantially in their natural condition. Withdrawals of water which would conflict therewith shall be authorized only in those situations where it is clear that overriding considerations of the public interest will be served.(b) Waters of the state shall be of high quality.

The department, other state agencies, local governments, and planning units formed under *section 107 or 108 of this act shall evaluate the potential for the development of new storage projects and the benefits and effects of storage in reducing damage to stream banks and property, increasing the use of land, providing water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, power generation, and other beneficial uses, and improving streamflow regimes for fisheries and other instream uses.(5) Adequate and safe supplies of water shall be preserved and protected in potable condition to satisfy human domestic needs.(6) Multiple-purpose impoundment structures are to be preferred over single-purpose structures.
