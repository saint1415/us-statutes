When the religious organization does not partner with a managing agency, the religious organization is encouraged to partner with a local homeless services provider using the Washington homeless client managing information system.

Sec. 2000cc.\n\n(b) If such policies, ordinances, memoranda of understanding, and consent decrees are amended after June 11, 2020, those amendments are not affected by subsection (2) of this section if those amendments satisfy (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection.\n\n(8) An appointed or elected public official, public employee, or public agency as defined in RCW 4.24.470 is immune from civil liability for (a) damages arising from the permitting decisions for a temporary encampment for the homeless as provided in this section and (b) any conduct or unlawful activity that may occur as a result of the temporary encampment for the homeless as provided in this section.\n\n(9) A religious organization hosting outdoor encampments, vehicle resident safe parking, or indoor overnight shelters for the homeless that receives funds from any government agency may not refuse to host any resident or prospective resident because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, as these terms are defined in RCW 49.60.040.\n\n(10)(a) Prior to the opening of an outdoor encampment, indoor overnight shelter, temporary small house on-site, or vehicle resident safe parking, a religious organization hosting the homeless on property owned or controlled by the religious organization must host a meeting open to the public for the purpose of providing a forum for discussion of related neighborhood concerns, unless the use is in response to a declared emergency. The religious organization must provide written notice of the meeting to the county legislative authority at least one week if possible but no later than ninety-six hours prior to the meeting. The notice must specify the time, place, and purpose of the meeting.\n\n(b) A county must provide community notice of the meeting described in (a) of this subsection by taking at least two of the following actions at any time prior to the time of the meeting:\n\n(i) Delivering to each local newspaper of general circulation and local radio or television station that has on file with the governing body a written request to be notified of special meetings;\n\n(ii) Posting on the county's website. A county is not required to post a special meeting notice on its website if it: (A) Does not have a website; (B) employs fewer than ten full-time equivalent employees; or (C) does not employ personnel whose duty, as defined by a job description or existing contract, is to maintain or update the website;\n\n(iii) Prominently displaying, on signage at least two feet in height and two feet in width, one or more meeting notices that can be placed on or adjacent to the main arterials in proximity to the location of the meeting; or\n\n(iv) Prominently displaying the notice at the meeting site.\n\n[ 2020 c 223 s 2; 2010 c 175 s 2.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2020 c 223: \"(1) The legislature makes the following findings:(a) Residents in temporary settings hosted by religious organizations are a particularly vulnerable population that do not have access to the same services as citizens with more stable housing.(b) Residents in these settings, including outdoor uses such as outdoor encampments, indoor overnight shelters, temporary small houses on-site, and homeless-occupied vehicle resident safe parking, can be at increased risk of exploitation, theft, unsanitary living conditions, and physical harm.(c) Furthermore, the legislature finds and declares that hosted outdoor encampments, indoor overnight shelters, temporary small houses on-site, and homeless-occupied vehicle resident safe parking serve as pathways for individuals experiencing homelessness to receive services and achieve financial stability, health, and permanent housing.(2) The legislature intends that local municipalities have the discretion to protect the health and safety of both residents in temporary settings that are hosted by religious organizations and the surrounding community.

In complying with this subsection (3)(b), the county must consider whether the repaired or replaced on-site septic system contributes to the pollution of surface waters or groundwater;\n\n(c) There are public sewer system performance or financing considerations related to allowing the property owner to repair or replace the on-site septic system; and\n\n(d) There are financial assistance programs or latecomer agreements offered by the county or state that may impact a decision of the property owner to repair or replace the on-site septic system.\n\n(4) If the county, following the appeals process required by this section, determines that the property owner must connect the residence to the public sewer system, the property owner may, in complying with the determination and subject to approval of appropriate permits, select and hire contractors at his or her own expense to perform the work necessary to connect the residence to the public sewer system.\n\n(5) Unless otherwise required by law, a county determination requiring the owner of a single-family residence with a failing on-site septic system to connect a residence to a public sewer system is not subject to appeal.\n\n[ 2015 c 297 s 3.]",
