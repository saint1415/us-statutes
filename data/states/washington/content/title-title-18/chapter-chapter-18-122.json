The legislature further recognizes the number of allied health professions seeking independent practice. Potentially at least one hundred forty-five discrete health professions and occupations are recognized nationally, with at least two hundred fifty secondary job classifications. A uniform and streamlined credentialing process needs to be established to permit the department of health to administer the health professional regulatory programs in the most cost-effective, accountable, and uniform manner.
