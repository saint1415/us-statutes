The hearing shall be limited to the sole issue of the capacity of the license holder to practice with reasonable skill and safety.

The license holder shall be provided written notice of the disciplining authority's intent to order a mental or physical examination, which notice shall include: (i) A statement of the specific conduct, event, or circumstances justifying an examination; (ii) a summary of the evidence supporting the disciplining authority's concern that the license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental or physical condition, and the grounds for believing such evidence to be credible and reliable; (iii) a statement of the nature, purpose, scope, and content of the intended examination; (iv) a statement that the license holder has the right to respond in writing within twenty days to challenge the disciplining authority's grounds for ordering an examination or to challenge the manner or form of the examination; and (v) a statement that if the license holder timely responds to the notice of intent, then the license holder will not be required to submit to the examination while the response is under consideration.(b) Upon submission of a timely response to the notice of intent to order a mental or physical examination, the license holder shall have an opportunity to respond to or refute such an order by submission of evidence or written argument or both. The evidence and written argument supporting and opposing the mental or physical examination shall be reviewed by either a panel of the disciplining authority members who have not been involved with the allegations against the license holder or a neutral decision maker approved by the disciplining authority.

Further, the action or discipline ordered by the disciplining authority shall not be more severe than a suspension of the license, certification, registration, or application until such time as the license holder complies with the properly ordered mental or physical examination.(e) Nothing in this section shall restrict the power of a disciplining authority to act in an emergency under RCW 34.05.422(4), 34.05.479, and 18.130.050(8).(f) A determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that a license holder is mentally incompetent or an individual with mental illness is presumptive evidence of the license holder's inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety.

In the investigation of the complaints, the secretary shall have the same authority as provided the secretary under RCW 18.130.050.(2) The secretary may issue a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the secretary has reason to believe is engaged in the unlicensed practice of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. The person to whom such notice is issued may request an adjudicative proceeding to contest the charges. The request for hearing must be filed within twenty days after service of the notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order. The failure to request a hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the secretary may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine. All proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.(3) If the secretary makes a final determination that a person has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed practice, the secretary may issue a cease and desist order. In addition, the secretary may impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in unlicensed practice of a business or profession for which a license is required by one or more of the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040.
