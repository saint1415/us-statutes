The board may refuse to grant a license on the ground of failure to satisfy this requirement only if there is a substantial connection between the lack of good character of the applicant and the professional and ethical responsibilities of a licensee and if the finding by the board of lack of good character is supported by a preponderance of evidence.

Persons holding a lapsed license are prohibited from using the title \"CPA,\" \"certified public accountant,\" \"CPA-inactive,\" or \"CPA-retired.\" Persons holding a lapsed license are prohibited from practicing public accountancy. The board shall adopt rules providing for fees and procedures for issuance, renewal, and reinstatement of licenses.\n\n(4) The board shall adopt rules providing for CPE for active or inactive licensees and certificate holders. The rules shall:\n\n(a) Provide that an active licensee shall verify to the board that the licensee has completed at least an accumulation of one hundred twenty hours of CPE during the last three-year period to maintain the active license;\n\n(b) Provide that an individual with an inactive license must verify to the board that the inactive licensee has completed a board-approved ethics course for CPE during the last three-year period to maintain the inactive license;\n\n(c) Establish CPE requirements; and\n\n(d) Establish when new licensees shall verify that they have completed the required CPE.\n\n(5) A certified public accountant who holds a license issued by another state, and applies for a license in this state, may practice in this state from the date of filing a completed application with the board, until the board has acted upon the application provided the application is made prior to holding out as a certified public accountant in this state and no sanctions or investigations, deemed by the board to be pertinent to public accountancy, by other jurisdictions or agencies are in process.\n\n(6)(a) A licensee shall submit to the board satisfactory proof of having completed an accumulation of one hundred twenty hours of CPE recognized and approved by the board during the preceding three years. Failure to furnish this evidence as required shall make the license lapse and subject to reinstatement procedures, unless the board determines the failure to have been due to retirement or reasonable cause.\n\n(b) The board in its discretion may renew a license despite failure to furnish evidence of compliance with requirements of CPE upon condition that the applicant follow a particular program of CPE. In issuing rules and individual orders with respect to CPE requirements, the board, among other considerations, may rely upon guidelines and pronouncements of recognized educational and professional associations, may prescribe course content, duration, and organization, and may take into account the accessibility of CPE to licensees and instances of individual hardship.\n\n(7) Fees for renewal or reinstatement of licenses in this state shall be determined by the board under this chapter.
