It is further the intent of the legislature that assisted living facilities be available to meet the needs of those for whom they care by recognizing the capabilities of individuals to direct their self-medication or to use supervised self-medication techniques when ordered and approved by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW or a podiatric physician and surgeon licensed under chapter 18.22 RCW.The legislature finds that many residents of community-based long-term care facilities are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and residents' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development, establishment, and enforcement of standards for the maintenance and operation of assisted living facilities, which, in the light of advancing knowledge, will promote safe and adequate care of the individuals therein.

However, an assisted living facility that is licensed for three to six residents prior to or on July 1, 2000, may maintain its assisted living facility license as long as it is continually licensed as an assisted living facility. \"Assisted living facility\" shall not include facilities certified as group training homes pursuant to RCW 71A.22.040, nor any home, institution or section thereof which is otherwise licensed and regulated under the provisions of state law providing specifically for the licensing and regulation of such home, institution or section thereof. Nor shall it include any independent senior housing, independent living units in continuing care retirement communities, or other similar living situations including those subsidized by the department of housing and urban development.(3) \"Basic services\" means housekeeping services, meals, nutritious snacks, laundry, and activities.(4) \"Dementia\" means the irreversible loss of cognitive or intellectual function such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning so severe that it interferes with an individual's daily functioning and everyday life. \"Dementia\" is not a specific diagnosis, but rather a group of symptoms that accompany certain diseases or conditions including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, alcohol-related dementia, and major neurocognitive disorder. \"Dementia\" does not include temporary or reversible destabilization due to delirium or behavioral or mental health disorders.(5) \"Department\" means the state department of social and health services.(6) \"Domiciliary care\" means: Assistance with activities of daily living provided by the assisted living facility either directly or indirectly; or health support services, if provided directly or indirectly by the assisted living facility; or intermittent nursing services, if provided directly or indirectly by the assisted living facility.(7) \"General responsibility for the safety and well-being of the resident\" means the provision of the following: Prescribed general low sodium diets; prescribed general diabetic diets; prescribed mechanical soft foods; emergency assistance; monitoring of the resident; arranging health care appointments with outside health care providers and reminding residents of such appointments as necessary; coordinating health care services with outside health care providers consistent with RCW 18.20.380; assisting the resident to obtain and maintain glasses, hearing aids, dentures, canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, and assistive communication devices; observation of the resident for changes in overall functioning; blood pressure checks as scheduled; responding appropriately when there are observable or reported changes in the resident's physical, mental, or emotional functioning; or medication assistance as permitted under RCW 69.41.085 and as defined in RCW 69.41.010.(8) \"Legal representative\" means a person or persons identified in RCW 7.70.065 who may act on behalf of the resident pursuant to the scope of their legal authority.

Neither the substance of the complaint provided to the licensee or contractor nor any copy of the complaint or related report published, released, or made otherwise available shall disclose, or reasonably lead to the disclosure of, the name, title, or identity of any complainant, or other person mentioned in the complaint, except that the name of the provider and the name or names of any officer, employee, or agent of the department conducting the investigation shall be disclosed after the investigation has been closed and the complaint has been substantiated. The department may disclose the identity of the complainant if such disclosure is requested in writing by the complainant.

Any attempt to discharge a resident against the resident's wishes, or any type of retaliatory treatment of a resident by whom or upon whose behalf a complaint substantiated by the department has been made to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, within one year of the filing of the complaint, raises a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the filing of the complaint. \"Retaliatory treatment\" means, but is not limited to, monitoring a resident's phone, mail, or visits; involuntary seclusion or isolation; transferring a resident to a different room unless requested or based upon legitimate management reasons; withholding or threatening to withhold food or treatment unless authorized by a terminally ill resident or his or her representative pursuant to law; or persistently delaying responses to a resident's request for service or assistance. A facility licensed under this chapter shall not willfully interfere with the performance of official duties by a long-term care ombuds. The department shall sanction and may impose a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars for a violation of this subsection.\n\n(1) The department shall establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for receiving complaints regarding a facility that the department licenses.\n\n(2) All facilities that are licensed under this chapter shall post in a place and manner clearly visible to residents and visitors the department's toll-free complaint telephone number and the toll-free number and program description of the long-term care ombuds as provided by RCW 43.190.050.\n\n(3) The department shall investigate complaints if the subject of the complaint is within its authority unless the department determines that: (a) The complaint is intended to willfully harass a licensee or employee of the licensee; or (b) there is no reasonable basis for investigation; or (c) corrective action has been taken as determined by the ombuds or the department.\n\n(4) The department shall refer complaints to appropriate state agencies, law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, the long-term care ombuds, or other entities if the department lacks authority to investigate or if its investigation reveals that a follow-up referral to one or more of these entities is appropriate.\n\n(5) The department shall adopt rules that include the following complaint investigation protocols:\n\n(a) Upon receipt of a complaint, the department shall make a preliminary review of the complaint, assess the severity of the complaint, and assign an appropriate response time. Complaints involving imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being of a resident must be responded to within two days. When appropriate, the department shall make an on-site investigation within a reasonable time after receipt of the complaint or otherwise ensure that complaints are responded to.\n\n(b) The complainant must be: Promptly contacted by the department, unless anonymous or unavailable despite several attempts by the department, and informed of the right to discuss alleged violations with the inspector and to provide other information the complainant believes will assist the inspector; informed of the department's course of action; and informed of the right to receive a written copy of the investigation report.\n\n(c) In conducting the investigation, the department shall interview the complainant, unless anonymous, and shall use its best efforts to interview the resident or residents allegedly harmed by the violations, and, in addition to facility staff, any available independent sources of relevant information, including if appropriate the family members of the resident.\n\n(d) Substantiated complaints involving harm to a resident, if an applicable law or regulation has been violated, shall be subject to one or more of the actions provided in RCW 18.20.190.

These individuals and entities shall satisfy the criteria established under this chapter or by the department for approving licensees. The department shall not approve or appoint any person, including partnerships and other entities, if that person is affiliated with the assisted living facility subject to the temporary management, or has owned or operated an assisted living facility ordered into temporary management or receivership in any state. When approving or appointing a temporary manager, the department shall consider the temporary manager's past experience in long-term care, the quality of care provided, the temporary manager's availability, and the person's familiarity with applicable state and federal laws. Subject to the provisions of this section and RCW 18.20.430, the department's authority to approve or appoint a temporary manager is discretionary and not subject to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.(3) When the department appoints a temporary manager, the department shall enter into a contract with the temporary manager and shall order the licensee to cease operating the assisted living facility and immediately turn over to the temporary manager possession and control of the assisted living facility, including but not limited to all resident care records, financial records, and other records necessary for operation of the facility while temporary management is in effect. If the department has not appointed a temporary manager and the licensee elects to participate in the temporary management program, the licensee shall select the temporary manager, subject to the department's approval, and enter into a contract with the temporary manager, consistent with this section. The department has the discretion to approve or revoke any temporary management arrangements made by the licensee.(4) When the department appoints a temporary manager, the costs associated with the temporary management may be paid for through the assisted living facility temporary management account established by RCW 18.20.430, or from other departmental funds, or a combination thereof. All funds must be administered according to department procedures. The department may enter into an agreement with the licensee allowing the licensee to pay for some of the costs associated with a temporary manager appointed by the department.

This notification shall include notice that residents may move from the assisted living facility without notifying the licensee or temporary manager in advance, and without incurring any charges, fees, or costs otherwise available for insufficient advance notice, during the temporary management period. The notification shall also inform residents and their families or representatives that the temporary management team will provide residents help with relocation and appropriate discharge planning and coordination if desired. The department shall provide assistance with relocation to residents who are department clients and may provide such assistance to other residents. The temporary manager shall meet regularly with staff, residents, residents' representatives, and families to inform them of the plans for and progress achieved in the correction of deficiencies, and of the plans for facility closure or continued operation.(7) The department shall terminate temporary management:(a) After sixty days unless good cause is shown to continue the temporary management. Good cause for continuing the temporary management exists when returning the assisted living facility to its former licensee would subject residents to a threat to health, safety, or welfare;(b) When all residents are transferred and the assisted living facility is closed;(c) When deficiencies threatening residents' health, safety, or welfare are eliminated and the former licensee agrees to department-specified conditions regarding the continued facility operation; or(d) When a new licensee assumes control of the assisted living facility.Nothing in this section precludes the department from revoking its approval of the temporary management or exercising its licensing enforcement authority under this chapter.

The term is most often applied to assisted living communities or other residential settings that offer specialized services and a specially designed environment that accommodates the needs of this population;(b) A growing number of assisted living facilities use memory care in their names or their service descriptions and advertise themselves as providing memory care, Alzheimer's care, or dementia care.
