No wire or cable, except the neutral, carrying a current of less than seven hundred fifty volts of electricity within the corporate limits of any city or town shall be run, placed, erected, maintained, or used on any insulator the center of which is less than thirteen inches from the center line of any pole. And no such wire, except the neutral, shall be run past any pole to which it is not attached at a distance of less than thirteen inches from the center line thereof. This rule shall not apply to any wire or cable where the same is run from under ground and placed vertically on the pole; nor to any wire or cable where the same is attached to the top of the pole; nor to a pole top fixture as between it and the same pole; nor to any wire or cable between the points where the same is made to leave any pole or fixture thereon for the purpose of entering any building or other structure and the point of attachment to such building or structure; nor to any jumper wire or cable carrying a current or connected with a transformer or other appliance on the same pole; nor to bridle or jumper wires on any pole which are attached to or connected with signal wires on the same pole; nor to any aerial cable as between such cable and any pole upon which it originates or terminates; nor to exclusive telephone or telegraph toll lines; nor to aerial cables containing telephone, telegraph, or signal wires, or wires continuing from same, where the cable is attached to poles on which no wires or cables other than the wires continuing from said cable are maintained, provided, that electric light or power wires or cables are in no case maintained on the same side of the street or highway on which said aerial cable is placed.Rule 2. No wire or cable used to carry a current of over seven hundred fifty volts of electricity within the incorporate limits of any city or town shall be run, placed, erected, maintained, or used on any insulator the center of which is nearer than twenty-four inches to the center line of any pole. And no such wire or cable shall be run past any pole to which it is not attached at a distance of less than twenty-four inches from the center line thereof: PROVIDED, That this shall not apply to any wire or cable where the same is run from under ground and placed vertically on the pole; nor to any wire or cable where the same is attached to the top of the pole; nor to a pole top fixture, as between it and the same pole; nor to any wire or cable between the points where the same is made to leave any pole or fixture thereon for the purpose of entering any building or other structure, and the point of attachment to said building or structure; nor to any jumper wire or cable carrying a current or connected with transformers or other appliances on the same pole: PROVIDED FURTHER, That where said wire or cable is run vertically, it shall be rigidly supported and where possible run on the ends of the cross-arms.Rule 3. No wire or cable carrying a current of more than seven hundred fifty volts, and less than seventy-five hundred volts of electricity, shall be run, placed, erected, maintained, or used within three feet of any wire or cable carrying a current of seven hundred fifty volts or less of electricity; and no wire or cable carrying a current of more than seventy-five hundred volts of electricity shall be run, placed, erected, maintained, or used within seven feet of any wire or cable carrying less than seventy-five hundred volts: PROVIDED, That the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any wire or cable within buildings or other structures; nor where the same are run from under ground and placed vertically upon the pole; nor to any service wire or cable where the same is made to leave any pole or fixture thereon for the purpose of entering any building or other structure, and the point of attachment to said building or structure; nor to any jumper wire or cable carrying a current or connected with a transformer or other appliance on the same pole: PROVIDED, That where run vertically, wires or cables shall be rigidly supported, and where possible run on the ends of the cross-arms: PROVIDED FURTHER, That as between any two wires or cables mentioned in Rules 1, 2, and 3 of this section, only the wires or cables last in point of time so run, placed, erected, or maintained, shall be held to be in violation of the provisions thereof.Rule 4. No wire or cable used for telephone, telegraph, district messenger, or call bell circuit, fire or burglar alarm, or any other similar system, shall be run, placed, erected, maintained, or used on any pole at a distance of less than three feet from any wire or cable carrying a current of over three hundred volts of electricity; and in all cases (except those mentioned in exceptions to Rules 1, 2, and 3) where such wires or cables are run, above or below, or cross over or under electric light or power wires, or a trolley wire, a suitable method of construction, or insulation or protection to prevent contact shall be maintained as between such wire or cable and such electric light, power or trolley wire; and said methods of construction, insulation, or protection shall be installed by, or at the expense of the person owning the wire last placed in point of time: PROVIDED, That telephone, telegraph, or signal wires or cables operated for private use and not furnishing service to the public, may be placed less than three feet from any line carrying a voltage of less than seven hundred and fifty volts.Rule 5.
