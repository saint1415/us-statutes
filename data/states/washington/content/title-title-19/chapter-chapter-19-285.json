      "text": "RCW 19.285.040\n\nEnergy conservation and renewable energy targets.\n\n(1) Each qualifying utility shall pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable, and feasible.(a) By January 1, 2010, using methodologies consistent with those used by the Pacific Northwest electric power and conservation planning council in the most recently published regional power plan as it existed on June 12, 2014, or a subsequent date as may be provided by the department or the commission by rule, each qualifying utility shall identify its achievable cost-effective conservation potential through 2019. Nothing in the rule adopted under this subsection precludes a qualifying utility from using its utility specific conservation measures, values, and assumptions in identifying its achievable cost-effective conservation potential. At least every two years thereafter, the qualifying utility shall review and update this assessment for the subsequent ten-year period.(b) Beginning January 2010, each qualifying utility shall establish and make publicly available a biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation consistent with its identification of achievable opportunities in (a) of this subsection, and meet that target during the subsequent two-year period. At a minimum, each biennial target must be no lower than the qualifying utility's pro rata share for that two-year period of its cost-effective conservation potential for the subsequent ten-year period.(c)(i) Except as provided in (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, beginning on January 1, 2014, cost-effective conservation achieved by a qualifying utility in excess of its biennial acquisition target may be used to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 20 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings.(ii) Beginning January 1, 2014, a qualifying utility may use single large facility conservation savings in excess of its biennial target to meet up to an additional five percent of the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c)(ii), \"single large facility conservation savings\" means cost-effective conservation savings achieved in a single biennial period at the premises of a single customer of a qualifying utility whose annual electricity consumption prior to the conservation savings exceeded five average megawatts.(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, and until December 31, 2017, a qualifying utility with an industrial facility located in a county with a population between 95,000 and 115,000 that is directly interconnected with electricity facilities that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage may use cost-effective conservation from that industrial facility in excess of its biennial acquisition target to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined.(d) In meeting its conservation targets, a qualifying utility may count high-efficiency cogeneration owned and used by a retail electric customer to meet its own needs. High-efficiency cogeneration is the sequential production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a common fuel source, where, under normal operating conditions, the facility has a useful thermal energy output of no less than 33 percent of the total energy output. The reduction in load due to high-efficiency cogeneration shall be: (i) Calculated as the ratio of the fuel chargeable to power heat rate of the cogeneration facility compared to the heat rate on a new and clean basis of a best-commercially available technology combined-cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbine; and (ii) counted towards meeting the biennial conservation target in the same manner as other conservation savings.(e) A qualifying utility is considered in compliance with its biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation in (b) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the conservation target. Events that a qualifying utility may demonstrate were beyond its reasonable control, that could not have reasonably been anticipated or ameliorated, and that prevented it from meeting the conservation target include: (i) Natural disasters resulting in the issuance of extended emergency declarations; (ii) the cancellation of significant conservation projects; and (iii) actions of a governmental authority that adversely affects the acquisition of cost-effective conservation by the qualifying utility.(f) The commission may determine if a conservation program implemented by an investor-owned utility is cost-effective based on the commission's policies and practice.(g) In addition to the requirements of RCW 19.280.030(3), in assessing the cost-effective conservation required under this section, a qualifying utility is encouraged to promote the adoption of air conditioning, as defined in RCW 70A.60.010, with refrigerants not exceeding a global warming potential of 750 and the replacement of stationary refrigeration systems that contain ozone-depleting substances or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants with a high global warming potential.(h) The commission may rely on its standard practice for review and approval of investor-owned utility conservation targets.(2)(a) Except as provided in (j) of this subsection, each qualifying utility shall use eligible renewable resources or acquire equivalent renewable energy credits, or any combination of them, to meet the following annual targets:(i) At least three percent of its load by January 1, 2012, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2015;(ii) At least nine percent of its load by January 1, 2016, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2019; and(iii) At least 15 percent of its load by January 1, 2020, and each year thereafter.(b)(i) Except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection, a qualifying utility may count distributed generation at double the facility's electrical output if the utility: (A) Owns or has contracted for the distributed generation and the associated renewable energy credits; or (B) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits.(ii) For new distributed generation that is a distributed energy priority described in RCW 43.21F.100 that commences operation after July 27, 2025, located within the geographical area in which the utility provides service, through December 31, 2029, the qualifying utility may count the distributed generation at four times the facility's electrical output if the utility: (A) Owns or has contracted for the distributed generation and the associated renewable energy credits; or (B) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits.(c) In meeting the annual targets in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility shall calculate its annual load based on the average of the utility's load for the previous two years.(d) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if: (i) The utility's weather-adjusted load for the previous three years on average did not increase over that time period; (ii) after December 7, 2006, the utility did not commence or renew ownership or incremental purchases of electricity from resources other than coal transition power or renewable resources other than on a daily spot price basis and the electricity is not offset by equivalent renewable energy credits; and (iii) the utility invested at least one percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement that year on eligible renewable resources, renewable energy credits, or a combination of both.(e) A qualifying utility may use renewable energy credits to meet the requirements of this section, subject to the limitations of this subsection.(i) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by a resource other than freshwater may be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created, the year before the year in which the credit was created, or the year after the year in which the credit was created.(ii) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by freshwater:(A) May only be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created; and(B) Must be acquired by the qualifying utility through ownership of the generation facility or through a transaction that conveyed both the electricity and the nonpower attributes of the electricity.(iii) A renewable energy credit transferred to an investor-owned utility pursuant to the Bonneville power administration's residential exchange program may not be used by any utility other than the utility receiving the credit from the Bonneville power administration.(iv) Each renewable energy credit may only be used once to meet the requirements of this section and must be retired using procedures of the renewable energy credit tracking system.(f) In complying with the targets established in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility may not count:(i) Eligible renewable resources or distributed generation where the associated renewable energy credits are owned by a separate entity; or(ii) Eligible renewable resources or renewable energy credits obtained for and used in an optional pricing program such as the program established in RCW 19.29A.090.(g) Where fossil and combustible renewable resources are cofired in one generating unit located in the Pacific Northwest where the cofiring commenced after March 31, 1999, the unit shall be considered to produce eligible renewable resources in direct proportion to the percentage of the total heat value represented by the heat value of the renewable resources.(h)(i) A qualifying utility that acquires an eligible renewable resource or renewable energy credit may count that acquisition at one and two-tenths times its base value:(A) Where the eligible renewable resource comes from a facility that commenced operation after December 31, 2005; and(B) Where the developer of the facility used apprenticeship programs approved by the council during facility construction.(ii) The council shall establish minimum levels of labor hours to be met through apprenticeship programs to qualify for this extra credit.(i) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the renewable energy target. Such events include weather-related damage, mechanical failure, strikes, lockouts, and actions of a governmental authority that adversely affect the generation, transmission, or distribution of an eligible renewable resource under contract to a qualifying utility.(j)(i) Beginning January 1, 2016, only a qualifying utility that owns or is directly interconnected to a qualified biomass energy facility may use qualified biomass energy to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection.(ii) A qualifying utility may no longer use electricity and associated renewable energy credits from a qualified biomass energy facility if the associated industrial pulping or wood manufacturing facility ceases operation other than for purposes of maintenance or upgrade.(k) An industrial facility that hosts a qualified biomass energy facility may only transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy generated at its facility to the qualifying utility with which it is directly interconnected with facilities owned by such a qualifying utility and that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage. The qualifying utility may only use an amount of renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy that are equivalent to the proportionate amount of its annual targets under (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection that was created by the load of the industrial facility. A qualifying utility that owns a qualified biomass energy facility may not transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy to another person, entity, or qualifying utility.(l) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance if the utility uses any combination of eligible renewable resources as defined in RCW 19.285.030, accelerated conservation, and demand response as defined in subsection (4) of this section to meet its compliance obligations under this subsection (2).(m) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying utility may use eligible renewable resources as identified under RCW 19.285.030(12) (g) and (h) to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection (2). A qualifying utility may not transfer or sell these eligible renewable resources to another utility for compliance purposes under this chapter.(n) Beginning January 1, 2030, a qualifying utility is considered to be in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if the utility uses electricity from: (i) Renewable resources and renewable energy credits as defined in RCW 19.285.030; and (ii) nonemitting electric generation as defined in RCW 19.405.020, in an amount equal to 100 percent of the utility's average annual retail electric load. Nothing in this subsection relieves the requirements of a qualifying utility to comply with subsection (1) of this section.(o) A qualifying utility shall exclude from its annual targets under this subsection (2) its voluntary renewable energy purchases.(3) Utilities that become qualifying utilities after December 31, 2006, shall meet the requirements in this section on a time frame comparable in length to that provided for qualifying utilities as of December 7, 2006.(4) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:(a)(i) \"Accelerated conservation\" means conservation included in the qualifying utility's most recent cost-effective conservation potential established in compliance with subsection (1)(a) of this section and in excess of the biennial acquisition target established in compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section.(ii) Accelerated conservation acquired in the target year must be in an amount no less than the annual target amount under subsection (2)(a) of this section, as measured in megawatt-hours.(iii) The amount of accelerated conservation must be measured as the annual energy savings measured in megawatt-hours multiplied by the number of years the conservation measure acquired will be in operation between July 27, 2025, until January 1, 2030.(iv) Any conservation savings used under this alternative compliance method may not be included as excess conservation savings under subsection (1)(c) of this section.(b) \"Demand response\" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020, except that \"demand response\" also includes energy storage that is a distributed energy priority identified in RCW 43.21F.100 when the energy storage enables the utility to reduce system peak demand. For the purpose of quantifying the amount of demand response eligible to be claimed under subsection (2)(l) of this section, the following requirements apply:(i) The amount of demand response must be converted to a megawatt-hour amount by determining the reduction in peak load in megawatts the demand response measure could deliver, dividing this value by the system peak demand in megawatts of the qualifying utility, and multiplying this value by the average annual system load of the utility in megawatt-hours.(ii) A utility claiming demand response resources under this subsection must maintain and apply measurement and verification protocols to determine the amount of capacity resulting from demand response resources and to verify the acquisition or installation of the demand response resources being recorded or claimed. A utility may provide a measurement or verification protocol that is not a direct measurement, but must document its methodologies, assumptions, and factual inputs.\n\n(1) Each qualifying utility shall pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable, and feasible.\n\n(a) By January 1, 2010, using methodologies consistent with those used by the Pacific Northwest electric power and conservation planning council in the most recently published regional power plan as it existed on June 12, 2014, or a subsequent date as may be provided by the department or the commission by rule, each qualifying utility shall identify its achievable cost-effective conservation potential through 2019. Nothing in the rule adopted under this subsection precludes a qualifying utility from using its utility specific conservation measures, values, and assumptions in identifying its achievable cost-effective conservation potential. At least every two years thereafter, the qualifying utility shall review and update this assessment for the subsequent ten-year period.\n\n(b) Beginning January 2010, each qualifying utility shall establish and make publicly available a biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation consistent with its identification of achievable opportunities in (a) of this subsection, and meet that target during the subsequent two-year period. At a minimum, each biennial target must be no lower than the qualifying utility's pro rata share for that two-year period of its cost-effective conservation potential for the subsequent ten-year period.\n\n(c)(i) Except as provided in (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, beginning on January 1, 2014, cost-effective conservation achieved by a qualifying utility in excess of its biennial acquisition target may be used to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 20 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings.\n\n(ii) Beginning January 1, 2014, a qualifying utility may use single large facility conservation savings in excess of its biennial target to meet up to an additional five percent of the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c)(ii), \"single large facility conservation savings\" means cost-effective conservation savings achieved in a single biennial period at the premises of a single customer of a qualifying utility whose annual electricity consumption prior to the conservation savings exceeded five average megawatts.\n\n(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, and until December 31, 2017, a qualifying utility with an industrial facility located in a county with a population between 95,000 and 115,000 that is directly interconnected with electricity facilities that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage may use cost-effective conservation from that industrial facility in excess of its biennial acquisition target to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined.\n\n(d) In meeting its conservation targets, a qualifying utility may count high-efficiency cogeneration owned and used by a retail electric customer to meet its own needs. High-efficiency cogeneration is the sequential production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a common fuel source, where, under normal operating conditions, the facility has a useful thermal energy output of no less than 33 percent of the total energy output. The reduction in load due to high-efficiency cogeneration shall be: (i) Calculated as the ratio of the fuel chargeable to power heat rate of the cogeneration facility compared to the heat rate on a new and clean basis of a best-commercially available technology combined-cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbine; and (ii) counted towards meeting the biennial conservation target in the same manner as other conservation savings.\n\n(e) A qualifying utility is considered in compliance with its biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation in (b) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the conservation target. Events that a qualifying utility may demonstrate were beyond its reasonable control, that could not have reasonably been anticipated or ameliorated, and that prevented it from meeting the conservation target include: (i) Natural disasters resulting in the issuance of extended emergency declarations; (ii) the cancellation of significant conservation projects; and (iii) actions of a governmental authority that adversely affects the acquisition of cost-effective conservation by the qualifying utility.\n\n(f) The commission may determine if a conservation program implemented by an investor-owned utility is cost-effective based on the commission's policies and practice.\n\n(g) In addition to the requirements of RCW 19.280.030(3), in assessing the cost-effective conservation required under this section, a qualifying utility is encouraged to promote the adoption of air conditioning, as defined in RCW 70A.60.010, with refrigerants not exceeding a global warming potential of 750 and the replacement of stationary refrigeration systems that contain ozone-depleting substances or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants with a high global warming potential.\n\n(h) The commission may rely on its standard practice for review and approval of investor-owned utility conservation targets.\n\n(2)(a) Except as provided in (j) of this subsection, each qualifying utility shall use eligible renewable resources or acquire equivalent renewable energy credits, or any combination of them, to meet the following annual targets:\n\n(i) At least three percent of its load by January 1, 2012, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2015;\n\n(ii) At least nine percent of its load by January 1, 2016, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2019; and\n\n(iii) At least 15 percent of its load by January 1, 2020, and each year thereafter.\n\n(b)(i) Except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection, a qualifying utility may count distributed generation at double the facility's electrical output if the utility: (A) Owns or has contracted for the distributed generation and the associated renewable energy credits; or (B) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n(ii) For new distributed generation that is a distributed energy priority described in RCW 43.21F.100 that commences operation after July 27, 2025, located within the geographical area in which the utility provides service, through December 31, 2029, the qualifying utility may count the distributed generation at four times the facility's electrical output if the utility: (A) Owns or has contracted for the distributed generation and the associated renewable energy credits; or (B) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n(c) In meeting the annual targets in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility shall calculate its annual load based on the average of the utility's load for the previous two years.\n\n(d) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if: (i) The utility's weather-adjusted load for the previous three years on average did not increase over that time period; (ii) after December 7, 2006, the utility did not commence or renew ownership or incremental purchases of electricity from resources other than coal transition power or renewable resources other than on a daily spot price basis and the electricity is not offset by equivalent renewable energy credits; and (iii) the utility invested at least one percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement that year on eligible renewable resources, renewable energy credits, or a combination of both.\n\n(e) A qualifying utility may use renewable energy credits to meet the requirements of this section, subject to the limitations of this subsection.\n\n(i) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by a resource other than freshwater may be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created, the year before the year in which the credit was created, or the year after the year in which the credit was created.\n\n(ii) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by freshwater:\n\n(A) May only be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created; and\n\n(B) Must be acquired by the qualifying utility through ownership of the generation facility or through a transaction that conveyed both the electricity and the nonpower attributes of the electricity.\n\n(iii) A renewable energy credit transferred to an investor-owned utility pursuant to the Bonneville power administration's residential exchange program may not be used by any utility other than the utility receiving the credit from the Bonneville power administration.\n\n(iv) Each renewable energy credit may only be used once to meet the requirements of this section and must be retired using procedures of the renewable energy credit tracking system.\n\n(f) In complying with the targets established in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility may not count:\n\n(i) Eligible renewable resources or distributed generation where the associated renewable energy credits are owned by a separate entity; or\n\n(ii) Eligible renewable resources or renewable energy credits obtained for and used in an optional pricing program such as the program established in RCW 19.29A.090.\n\n(g) Where fossil and combustible renewable resources are cofired in one generating unit located in the Pacific Northwest where the cofiring commenced after March 31, 1999, the unit shall be considered to produce eligible renewable resources in direct proportion to the percentage of the total heat value represented by the heat value of the renewable resources.\n\n(h)(i) A qualifying utility that acquires an eligible renewable resource or renewable energy credit may count that acquisition at one and two-tenths times its base value:\n\n(A) Where the eligible renewable resource comes from a facility that commenced operation after December 31, 2005; and\n\n(B) Where the developer of the facility used apprenticeship programs approved by the council during facility construction.\n\n(ii) The council shall establish minimum levels of labor hours to be met through apprenticeship programs to qualify for this extra credit.\n\n(i) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the renewable energy target. Such events include weather-related damage, mechanical failure, strikes, lockouts, and actions of a governmental authority that adversely affect the generation, transmission, or distribution of an eligible renewable resource under contract to a qualifying utility.\n\n(j)(i) Beginning January 1, 2016, only a qualifying utility that owns or is directly interconnected to a qualified biomass energy facility may use qualified biomass energy to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection.\n\n(ii) A qualifying utility may no longer use electricity and associated renewable energy credits from a qualified biomass energy facility if the associated industrial pulping or wood manufacturing facility ceases operation other than for purposes of maintenance or upgrade.\n\n(k) An industrial facility that hosts a qualified biomass energy facility may only transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy generated at its facility to the qualifying utility with which it is directly interconnected with facilities owned by such a qualifying utility and that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage. The qualifying utility may only use an amount of renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy that are equivalent to the proportionate amount of its annual targets under (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection that was created by the load of the industrial facility. A qualifying utility that owns a qualified biomass energy facility may not transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy to another person, entity, or qualifying utility.\n\n(l) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance if the utility uses any combination of eligible renewable resources as defined in RCW 19.285.030, accelerated conservation, and demand response as defined in subsection (4) of this section to meet its compliance obligations under this subsection (2).\n\n(m) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying utility may use eligible renewable resources as identified under RCW 19.285.030(12) (g) and (h) to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection (2). A qualifying utility may not transfer or sell these eligible renewable resources to another utility for compliance purposes under this chapter.\n\n(n) Beginning January 1, 2030, a qualifying utility is considered to be in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if the utility uses electricity from: (i) Renewable resources and renewable energy credits as defined in RCW 19.285.030; and (ii) nonemitting electric generation as defined in RCW 19.405.020, in an amount equal to 100 percent of the utility's average annual retail electric load. Nothing in this subsection relieves the requirements of a qualifying utility to comply with subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(o) A qualifying utility shall exclude from its annual targets under this subsection (2) its voluntary renewable energy purchases.\n\n(3) Utilities that become qualifying utilities after December 31, 2006, shall meet the requirements in this section on a time frame comparable in length to that provided for qualifying utilities as of December 7, 2006.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(a)(i) \"Accelerated conservation\" means conservation included in the qualifying utility's most recent cost-effective conservation potential established in compliance with subsection (1)(a) of this section and in excess of the biennial acquisition target established in compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section.\n\n(ii) Accelerated conservation acquired in the target year must be in an amount no less than the annual target amount under subsection (2)(a) of this section, as measured in megawatt-hours.\n\n(iii) The amount of accelerated conservation must be measured as the annual energy savings measured in megawatt-hours multiplied by the number of years the conservation measure acquired will be in operation between July 27, 2025, until January 1, 2030.\n\n(iv) Any conservation savings used under this alternative compliance method may not be included as excess conservation savings under subsection (1)(c) of this section.\n\n(b) \"Demand response\" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020, except that \"demand response\" also includes energy storage that is a distributed energy priority identified in RCW 43.21F.100 when the energy storage enables the utility to reduce system peak demand. For the purpose of quantifying the amount of demand response eligible to be claimed under subsection (2)(l) of this section, the following requirements apply:\n\n(i) The amount of demand response must be converted to a megawatt-hour amount by determining the reduction in peak load in megawatts the demand response measure could deliver, dividing this value by the system peak demand in megawatts of the qualifying utility, and multiplying this value by the average annual system load of the utility in megawatt-hours.\n\n(ii) A utility claiming demand response resources under this subsection must maintain and apply measurement and verification protocols to determine the amount of capacity resulting from demand response resources and to verify the acquisition or installation of the demand response resources being recorded or claimed.
