The notice of nonviolation must include the process for contesting the determination included in the notice of nonviolation through an administrative hearing.(6) Corrective action must take place within fifteen business days of the respondent's receipt of a notice of violation, except as required otherwise by the attorney general, unless the respondent has submitted a timely request for an administrative hearing to contest the notice of violation as required under subsection (8) of this section.

The department may require the submission of information necessary to assist in identifying and locating a manufactured/mobile home community and other information that may be useful to the state, which must include, at a minimum:(a) The names and addresses of the owners of the manufactured/mobile home community;(b) The name and address of the manufactured/mobile home community;(c) The name and address of the landlord and manager of the manufactured/mobile home community;(d) The number of lots within the manufactured/mobile home community that are subject to chapter 59.20 RCW; and(e) The addresses of each manufactured/mobile home lot within the manufactured/mobile home community that is subject to chapter 59.20 RCW.(3) Each manufactured/mobile home community landlord must pay to the department:(a) A one-time business license application fee for the first year of registration and, in subsequent years, an annual renewal application fee, as provided in RCW 19.02.075; and(b) An annual registration assessment of fifteen dollars for each manufactured/mobile home that is subject to chapter 59.20 RCW within a manufactured/mobile home community. Manufactured/mobile home community landlords may charge a maximum of five dollars of this assessment to tenants. Nine dollars of the registration assessment for each manufactured/mobile home must be deposited into the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program account created in RCW 59.30.070 to fund the costs associated with the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program.
