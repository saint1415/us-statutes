Upon notice to the director a bank chartered under this title and an out-of-state bank may engage in a combination if the combination would result in an out-of-state bank. However, that combination shall comply with applicable Washington law as determined by the director, including but not limited to applicable state merger laws, and the conditions and requirements of this section.(4) Applications for the director's approval under subsection (3) of this section shall be on a form prescribed by the director and conditioned upon payment of a fee prescribed pursuant to RCW 30A.04.070.

In lieu of notice from the proposed resulting bank the director may accept notice from the bank's supervisory agency having primary responsibility for the bank.

Sec. 1831u(b)(2)(B) shall apply to the combination of an out-of-state bank and a nonaffiliated out-of-state bank or bank organized under this title or under the national bank act if the combination is an interstate merger transaction.(7) A combination resulting in the acquisition, by an out-of-state bank that does not have branches in this state, of a bank organized under this title or the national bank act, shall not be permitted under this chapter unless the bank to be acquired, or its predecessors, have been in continuous operation, on the date of the combination, for a period of at least five years.\n\n(1) This section is applicable where the resulting bank would have branches inside and outside the state of Washington.\n\n(2) As used in this section, unless a different meaning is required by the context, the following words and phrases have the following meanings:\n\n(a) \"Combination\" means a merger or consolidation, or purchase or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, including all or substantially all of the branches.\n\n(b) \"Out-of-state bank\" means a bank, as defined in 12 U.S.C.
