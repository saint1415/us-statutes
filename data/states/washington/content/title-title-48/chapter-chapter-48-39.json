      "text": "RCW 48.39.003\n\nThe legislature finds that Washington state is a provider friendly state within which to practice medicine. As part of health care reform, Washington state endeavors to establish and operate a state-based health benefits exchange wherein insurance products will be offered for sale and add potentially three hundred thousand patients to commercial insurance, and to expand access to medicaid for potentially three hundred thousand new enrollees. Such a successful and new insurance market in Washington state will require the willing participation of all categories of health care providers. The legislature further finds that principles of fair contracting apply to all contracts between health care providers and health insurance carriers offering insurance within Washington state and that fair dealings and transparency in expectations should be present in interactions between all third-party payors and health care providers.\n\nThe legislature finds that Washington state is a provider friendly state within which to practice medicine.
