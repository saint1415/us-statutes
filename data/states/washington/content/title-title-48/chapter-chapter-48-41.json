The arrangements and the commissioner shall initially request an advisory opinion from the United States department of labor or obtain a declaratory ruling from a federal court on the legality of imposing assessments on these arrangements before imposing the assessment. Once the legality of the assessments has been determined, the multiple employer welfare arrangement certified by the insurance commissioner must begin payment of these assessments.\n\n(iii) If there has not been a final determination of the legality of these assessments, then beginning on the earlier of (A) the date the fourth multiple employer welfare arrangement has been certified by the insurance commissioner, or (B) April 1, 2006, the arrangement shall deposit the assessments imposed by this subsection into an interest bearing escrow account maintained by the arrangement. Upon a final determination that the assessments are not preempted by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq., all funds in the interest bearing escrow account shall be transferred to the board;\n\n(c) Issue policies of health coverage in accordance with the requirements of this chapter;\n\n(d) Establish procedures for the administration of the premium discount provided under RCW 48.41.200(3)(a)(iii);\n\n(e) Contract with the Washington state health care authority for the administration of the premium discounts provided under RCW 48.41.200(3)(a) (i) and (ii);\n\n(f) Set a reasonable fee to be paid to an insurance producer licensed in Washington state for submitting an acceptable application for enrollment in the pool; and\n\n(g) Provide certification to the commissioner when assessments will exceed the threshold level established in RCW 48.41.037.\n\n(2) In addition thereto, the board may:\n\n(a) Enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter including the authority, with the approval of the commissioner, to enter into contracts with similar pools of other states for the joint performance of common administrative functions, or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions;\n\n(b) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal action as necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the pool or the coverage provided by or through the pool;\n\n(c) Appoint appropriate legal, actuarial, and other committees as necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the pool, policy, and other contract design, and any other function within the authority of the pool; and\n\n(d) Conduct periodic audits to assure the general accuracy of the financial data submitted to the pool, and the board shall cause the pool to have an annual audit of its operations by an independent certified public accountant.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or authorize the adoption of rules under chapter 34.05 RCW.\n\n[ 2013 c 279 s 2; 2011 c 314 s 13; 2009 c 555 s 2; 2008 c 217 s 47; 2005 c 7 s 2; 2004 c 260 s 26; 2000 c 79 s 9; 1997 c 337 s 5; 1997 c 231 s 211; 1989 c 121 s 3; 1987 c 431 s 6.]\n\nEffective date—2013 c 279 ss 2 and 3: \"Sections 2 and 3 of this act take effect January 1, 2014.\" [ 2013 c 279 s 6.]\n\nEffective date—2013 c 279 ss 2 and 3: \"Sections 2 and 3 of this act take effect January 1, 2014.\" [ 2013 c 279 s 6.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2013 c 279: \"The federal patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, P.L. 111-148, as amended, prohibits the imposition of any preexisting condition coverage exceptions in the individual market for insurance coverage beginning January 1, 2014.

The copayment or coinsurance for mental health services may be no more than the copayment or coinsurance for medical and surgical services otherwise provided under the policy. Wellness and preventive services that are provided or reimbursed at a lesser copayment, coinsurance, or other cost sharing than other medical and surgical services are excluded from this comparison. If the policy imposes a maximum out-of-pocket limit or stop loss, it shall be a single limit or stop loss for medical, surgical, and mental health services. If the policy imposes any deductible, mental health services shall be included with medical and surgical services for the purpose of meeting the deductible requirement. Treatment limitations or any other financial requirements on coverage for mental health services are only allowed if the same limitations or requirements are imposed on coverage for medical and surgical services; and\n\n(b) Prescription drugs intended to treat any of the disorders covered in subsection (1) of this section to the same extent, and under the same terms and conditions, as other prescription drugs covered by the policy.\n\n(3) This section does not prohibit a requirement that mental health services be medically necessary, if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the management of mental health services if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.\n\n[ 2020 c 228 s 4; 2007 c 8 s 6.]\n\nEffective date—2007 c 8: See note following RCW 48.20.580.\n\nEffective date—2007 c 8: See note following RCW 48.20.580.",
