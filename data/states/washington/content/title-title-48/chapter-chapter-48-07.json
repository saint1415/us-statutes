Such domestic insurer is entitled to a certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state, subject to the conditions set forth in (b) of this subsection, and is subject to the authority and the jurisdiction of this state.(b) Before being eligible to become a domestic insurer under this section, an admitted insurer shall advise the commissioner, in writing, thirty days in advance of the proposed date of its plan to become a domestic insurer. The commissioner must approve the plan in advance of the proposed date. The commissioner shall not approve any such plan unless, after a hearing, pursuant to such notice as the commissioner may require, the commissioner finds that the plan is consistent with law, and that no reasonable objection to the plan exists. If the commissioner fails to approve the plan, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons for failure to approve the plan in an order issued at the hearing.(2) After providing thirty days' advance written notice of its plan to the commissioner and upon the written approval of the commissioner in advance of the proposed transfer date, any domestic insurer of this state may transfer its domicile to any other state in which it is admitted to transact the business of insurance.
