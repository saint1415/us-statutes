The member may purchase, beginning with the most recent judicial service, the higher benefit multiplier for that portion of the member's prior judicial service for which the higher benefit multiplier was not previously purchased, and that would ensure that the member has no more than a seventy-five percent of average final compensation benefit. The member shall pay five percent of the salary earned for each month of service for which the higher benefit multiplier is being purchased, plus five and one-half percent interest applied from the dates that the service was earned. The purchase price shall not exceed the actuarially equivalent value of the increase in the member's benefit resulting from the increase in the benefit multiplier.
