King County, Cause No. 82842-3. The court recognized that a public employees' retirement system eligible employee must work for a public employees' retirement system employer under RCW 41.40.010. However, the court did not explain how such an employee can be an employee of a government contractor and also of a government employer. The legislature determines it necessary and appropriate to affirmatively state that a governmental contractor is not an employer for purposes of the state's public pension systems, including the public employees' retirement system, whether or not the contractor is providing mandatory or discretionary governmental services, and whether or not the contractor is a for-profit or not-for-profit entity.(2) The legislature has not intended in its pension legislation to provide retirement system eligibility to employees of government contractors. Only in specific circumstances, such as employees of entities, including nonprofits, created by government under the interlocal cooperation act in chapter 39.34 RCW, has the legislature and department of retirement systems permitted retirement system eligibility for employees of government contractors. The department's rules in WAC 415-02-110 conform to the purpose and intent of the legislature regarding public pension eligibility.(3) It is the purpose of this act to more clearly state and to confirm that employees of for-profit or not-for-profit corporations or other entities providing services under governmental contracts are not, as a result of providing such governmental service, eligible for membership in the various public retirement programs. The state and its local governments have not provided for such eligibility and such eligibility would create unfunded liability for state and local governments and potential impacts on the integrity of the public pension systems.(4) This act provides cross-references to existing statutes that affect eligibility for pensions under the retirement systems authorized by chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and 41.50 RCW and to the relevant definition sections of those chapters. Except as provided, this act is technical in nature and neither enhances nor diminishes existing pension rights. It is not the intent of the legislature to change the substance or effect of any statute previously enacted. Rather, this act provides cross-references to applicable statutes in order to aid with the administration of eligibility and benefits authorized in chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and 41.50 RCW.(5) This act shall apply solely to eligibility for state-sponsored public employee pension plans under chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, and 41.40 RCW and shall not affect any other statute or rule regarding employee benefits, status, or workplace protections.(6) This act is curative and remedial, but does not affect the state supreme court decision in Dolan v. King County, Cause No. 82842-3, and the right established therein of King county public defenders and staff to public employees' retirement system enrollment and eligibility.\" [ 2012 c 236 s 1.]\n\nPurpose—Application—2012 c 236: \"(1) On August 18, 2011, the state supreme court entered an opinion in the matter of Dolan v. King County, Cause No. 82842-3. The court recognized that a public employees' retirement system eligible employee must work for a public employees' retirement system employer under RCW 41.40.010. However, the court did not explain how such an employee can be an employee of a government contractor and also of a government employer. The legislature determines it necessary and appropriate to affirmatively state that a governmental contractor is not an employer for purposes of the state's public pension systems, including the public employees' retirement system, whether or not the contractor is providing mandatory or discretionary governmental services, and whether or not the contractor is a for-profit or not-for-profit entity.\n\n(2) The legislature has not intended in its pension legislation to provide retirement system eligibility to employees of government contractors. Only in specific circumstances, such as employees of entities, including nonprofits, created by government under the interlocal cooperation act in chapter 39.34 RCW, has the legislature and department of retirement systems permitted retirement system eligibility for employees of government contractors. The department's rules in WAC 415-02-110 conform to the purpose and intent of the legislature regarding public pension eligibility.\n\n(3) It is the purpose of this act to more clearly state and to confirm that employees of for-profit or not-for-profit corporations or other entities providing services under governmental contracts are not, as a result of providing such governmental service, eligible for membership in the various public retirement programs. The state and its local governments have not provided for such eligibility and such eligibility would create unfunded liability for state and local governments and potential impacts on the integrity of the public pension systems.\n\n(4) This act provides cross-references to existing statutes that affect eligibility for pensions under the retirement systems authorized by chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and 41.50 RCW and to the relevant definition sections of those chapters. Except as provided, this act is technical in nature and neither enhances nor diminishes existing pension rights. It is not the intent of the legislature to change the substance or effect of any statute previously enacted. Rather, this act provides cross-references to applicable statutes in order to aid with the administration of eligibility and benefits authorized in chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, and 41.50 RCW.\n\n(5) This act shall apply solely to eligibility for state-sponsored public employee pension plans under chapters 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, and 41.40 RCW and shall not affect any other statute or rule regarding employee benefits, status, or workplace protections.\n\n(6) This act is curative and remedial, but does not affect the state supreme court decision in Dolan v.

Any accumulated contributions attributable to restorations made under RCW 41.50.165(2) shall be refunded at one hundred percent. A person in receipt of this benefit is a retiree.\n\n(7) A member who becomes disabled in the line of duty shall be entitled to receive a minimum retirement allowance equal to ten percent of such member's final average salary. The member shall additionally receive a retirement allowance equal to two percent of such member's average final salary for each year of service beyond five.\n\n(8) A member who became disabled in the line of duty before January 1, 2001, and is receiving an allowance under RCW 41.26.430 or subsection (1) of this section shall be entitled to receive a minimum retirement allowance equal to ten percent of such member's final average salary. The member shall additionally receive a retirement allowance equal to two percent of such member's average final salary for each year of service beyond five, and shall have the allowance actuarially reduced to reflect the difference in the number of years between age at disability and the attainment of age fifty-three. An additional benefit shall not result in a total monthly benefit greater than that provided in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(9) A member who is totally disabled in the line of duty is entitled to receive a retirement allowance equal to seventy percent of the member's final average salary. The allowance provided under this subsection shall be offset by:\n\n(a) Temporary disability wage-replacement benefits or permanent total disability benefits provided to the member under Title 51 RCW; and\n\n(b) Federal social security disability benefits, if any;\n\nso that such an allowance does not result in the member receiving combined benefits that exceed one hundred percent of the member's final average salary. However, the offsets shall not in any case reduce the allowance provided under this subsection below the member's accrued retirement allowance.\n\nA member is considered totally disabled if he or she is unable to perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental condition that may be expected to result in death or that has lasted or is expected to last at least twelve months. Substantial gainful activity is defined as average earnings in excess of eight hundred sixty dollars a month in 2006 adjusted annually as determined by the director based on federal social security disability standards. The department may require a person in receipt of an allowance under this subsection to provide any financial records that are necessary to determine continued eligibility for such an allowance. A person in receipt of an allowance under this subsection whose earnings exceed the threshold for substantial gainful activity shall have their benefit converted to a line-of-duty disability retirement allowance as provided in subsection (7) of this section.\n\nAny person in receipt of an allowance under the provisions of this section is subject to comprehensive medical examinations as may be required by the department under subsection (2) of this section in order to determine continued eligibility for such an allowance.\n\n(10)(a) In addition to the retirement allowance provided in subsection (9) of this section, the retirement allowance of a member who is totally disabled in the line of duty shall include reimbursement for any payments made by the member after June 10, 2010, for premiums on employer-provided medical insurance, insurance authorized by the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 (COBRA), medicare part A (hospital insurance), and medicare part B (medical insurance). A member who is entitled to medicare must enroll and maintain enrollment in both medicare part A and medicare part B in order to remain eligible for the reimbursement provided in this subsection. The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal the benefits provided in this subsection in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive any distribution not granted prior to that time.\n\n(b) The retirement allowance of a member who is not eligible for reimbursement provided in (a) of this subsection shall include reimbursement for any payments made after June 30, 2013, for premiums on other medical insurance. However, in no instance shall the reimbursement exceed the amount reimbursed for premiums authorized by the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 (COBRA).\n\n(11) A member who has left the employ of an employer due to service in the national guard, military reserves, federal emergency management agency, or national disaster medical system of the United States department of health and human services and who becomes totally incapacitated for continued employment by an employer as determined by the director while performing service in response to a disaster, major emergency, special event, federal exercise, or official training on or after March 22, 2014, shall be eligible to receive an allowance under the provisions of RCW 41.26.410 through 41.26.550. Such member shall receive a monthly disability allowance computed as provided for in RCW 41.26.420 except such allowance is not subject to an actuarial reduction for early retirement as provided in RCW 41.26.430. The member's retirement allowance is computed under RCW 41.26.420, except that the member shall be entitled to a minimum retirement allowance equal to ten percent of such member's final average salary. The member shall additionally receive a retirement allowance equal to two percent of such member's average final salary for each year of service beyond five.\n\n(12) A member who is in receipt of a nonduty disability benefit under subsection (1) of this section, for a disabling condition that was not considered an occupational disease by the department of labor and industries at the time the member retired but is now considered an occupational disease in accordance with the definition of posttraumatic stress disorder in RCW 51.08.165, may file a new application with the department for a determination of their eligibility for an in the line of duty disability retirement benefit under subsections (7) and (9) of this section with the current occupational disease eligibility applied to their application. If the department finds that the member is eligible for an in the line of duty disability retirement the benefit must be paid retroactive to the disabling condition being made eligible as an occupational disease under RCW 51.08.165.\n\n[ 2024 c 304 s 401; 2016 c 115 s 3; 2013 c 287 s 2; 2010 c 259 s 2.

This subsection shall only apply if the member's leave of absence is authorized by a collective bargaining agreement that provides that the member retains seniority rights with the employer during the period of leave. The basic salary reported for a member who establishes service credit under this subsection may not be greater than the salary paid to the highest paid job class covered by the collective bargaining agreement.(3) Except as specified in subsection (7) of this section, a member shall be eligible to receive a maximum of two years service credit during a member's entire working career for those periods when a member is on an unpaid leave of absence authorized by an employer. If the member retires instead of returning to work, the member is eligible for this credit. Such credit may be obtained only if the member makes the employer, member, and state contributions plus interest as determined by the department for the period of the authorized leave of absence within five years of resumption of service or prior to retirement whichever comes sooner.(4) A law enforcement member may be authorized by an employer to work part time and to go on a part-time leave of absence. During a part-time leave of absence a member is prohibited from any other employment with their employer. A member is eligible to receive credit for any portion of service credit not earned during a month of part-time leave of absence if the member makes the employer, member, and state contributions, plus interest, as determined by the department for the period of the authorized leave within five years of resumption of full-time service or prior to retirement whichever comes sooner. Any service credit purchased for a part-time leave of absence is included in the two-year maximum provided in subsection (3) of this section.(5) If a member fails to meet the time limitations of subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the member may receive a maximum of two years of service credit during a member's working career for those periods when a member is on unpaid leave of absence authorized by an employer. This may be done by paying the amount required under RCW 41.50.165(2) prior to retirement.(6) For the purpose of subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the contribution shall not include the contribution for the unfunded supplemental present value as required by RCW 41.45.060, 41.45.061, and 41.45.067. The contributions required shall be based on the average of the member's basic salary at both the time the authorized leave of absence was granted and the time the member resumed employment. If the member retires instead of returning to work, the contributions required shall be based on the member's basic salary at the time the authorized leave of absence was granted adjusted for any cost-of-living or other pay increases provided to similar jobs or job classes during the leave period.(7) A member who leaves the employ of an employer to enter the uniformed services of the United States shall be entitled to retirement system service credit for up to five years of military service. This subsection shall be administered in a manner consistent with the requirements of the federal uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act.(a) The member qualifies for service credit under this subsection if:(i) Within ninety days of the member's honorable discharge from the uniformed services of the United States, the member applies for reemployment with the employer who employed the member immediately prior to the member entering the uniformed services; and(ii) The member makes the employee contributions required under RCW 41.45.060, 41.45.061, and 41.45.067 within five years of resumption of service or prior to retirement, whichever comes sooner; or(iii) Prior to retirement and not within ninety days of the member's honorable discharge or five years of resumption of service the member pays the amount required under RCW 41.50.165(2); or(iv) Prior to retirement the member provides to the director proof that the member's interruptive military service was during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005. Any member who made payments for service credit for interruptive military service during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005 may, prior to retirement and on a form provided by the department, request a refund of the funds standing to his or her credit for up to five years of such service, and this amount shall be paid to him or her. Members with one or more periods of interruptive military service credit during a period of war may receive no more than five years of free retirement system service credit under this subsection.(b) Upon receipt of member contributions under (a)(ii), (d)(iii), or (e)(iii) of this subsection, or adequate proof under (a)(iv), (d)(iv), or (e)(iv) of this subsection, the department shall establish the member's service credit and shall bill the employer and the state for their respective contributions required under RCW 41.26.450 for the period of military service, plus interest as determined by the department.(c) The contributions required under (a)(ii), (d)(iii), or (e)(iii) of this subsection shall be based on the compensation the member would have earned if not on leave, or if that cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty, the compensation reported for the member in the year prior to when the member went on military leave.(d) The surviving spouse, domestic partner, or eligible child or children of a member who left the employ of an employer to enter the uniformed services of the United States and died while serving in the uniformed services may, on behalf of the deceased member, apply for retirement system service credit under this subsection up to the date of the member's death in the uniformed services. The department shall establish the deceased member's service credit if the surviving spouse or eligible child or children:(i) Provides to the director proof of the member's death while serving in the uniformed services;(ii) Provides to the director proof of the member's honorable service in the uniformed services prior to the date of death; and(iii) Pays the employee contributions required under chapter 41.45 RCW within five years of the date of death or prior to the distribution of any benefit, whichever comes first; or(iv) Prior to the distribution of any benefit, provides to the director proof that the member's interruptive military service was during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005. If the deceased member made payments for service credit for interruptive military service during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005, the surviving spouse or eligible child or children may, prior to the distribution of any benefit and on a form provided by the department, request a refund of the funds standing to the deceased member's credit for up to five years of such service, and this amount shall be paid to the surviving spouse or children. Members with one or more periods of interruptive military service during a period of war may receive no more than five years of free retirement system service credit under this subsection.(e) A member who leaves the employ of an employer to enter the uniformed services of the United States and becomes totally incapacitated for continued employment by an employer while serving in the uniformed services is entitled to retirement system service credit under this subsection up to the date of discharge from the uniformed services if:(i) The member obtains a determination from the director that he or she is totally incapacitated for continued employment due to conditions or events that occurred while serving in the uniformed services;(ii) The member provides to the director proof of honorable discharge from the uniformed services; and(iii) The member pays the employee contributions required under chapter 41.45 RCW within five years of the director's determination of total disability or prior to the distribution of any benefit, whichever comes first; or(iv) Prior to retirement the member provides to the director proof that the member's interruptive military service was during a period of war as defined in RCW 41.04.005.
