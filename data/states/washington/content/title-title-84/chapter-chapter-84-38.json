It is therefore deemed necessary that the legislature, in addition to that tax exemption as provided for in RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389 as now or hereafter amended, allow retired persons to defer payment of special assessments on their residences, and to defer their real property tax obligations on their residences, an amount of up to eighty percent of their equity in said property.

This lien may accumulate up to eighty percent of the amount of the claimant's equity value in the property and must bear interest at the rate of five percent per year from the time it could have been paid before delinquency until said obligation is paid. However, when taxes are deferred as provided in RCW 84.64.050, the amount must bear interest at the rate of five percent per year from the date the declaration is filed until the obligation is paid or the date that the obligation is charged off as finally uncollectible.
