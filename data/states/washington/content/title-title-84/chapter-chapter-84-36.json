The department of revenue must provide by rule a definition of homes eligible for exemption under this subsection (1)(b), consistent with the purposes of this section.(2) All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of the home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses the tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents. The initial term of the exemption under this subsection must equal the term of the tax exempt bond used in connection with the financing program, or the term of the requirement to reserve dwelling units for low-income residents, whichever is shorter. If the financing program involves less than the entire home, only those dwelling units included in the financing program are eligible for total exemption. The department of revenue must provide by rule the requirements for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this subsection and the requirements for exemption including:(a) The number or percentage of dwelling units required to be occupied by low-income residents, and a definition of low income;(b) The type and character of the dwelling units, whether independent units or otherwise; and(c) Any particular requirements for continuing care retirement communities.(3) A home for the aging is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property and a total exemption for the home's personal property if the home does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section because fewer than fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units are occupied by eligible residents, as follows:(a) A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by a resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living.(b) A partial exemption must be allowed for each dwelling unit in a home occupied by an eligible resident.(c) A partial exemption must be allowed for an area jointly used by a home for the aging and by a nonprofit organization, association, or corporation currently exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter. The shared area must be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the nonprofit organization, association, or corporation exempt from property taxation under one of the other provisions of this chapter, such as kitchen, dining, and laundry areas.(d) The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home, less the assessed value of any area exempt under (c) of this subsection, by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units occupied by eligible residents and by residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of occupied dwelling units as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational for which exemption is claimed and January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which exemption is claimed.(4) To be exempt under this section, the property must be used exclusively for the purposes for which the exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805.(5) A home for the aging is exempt from taxation only if the organization operating the home is exempt from income tax under section 501(c) of the federal internal revenue code as existing on January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purposes of this section.(6) In order for the home to be eligible for exemption under subsections (1)(a) and (3)(b) of this section, each eligible resident of a home for the aging must submit an income verification form to the county assessor by July 1st of the assessment year for which exemption is claimed. However, during the first year a home becomes operational, the county assessor must accept income verification forms from eligible residents up to December 31st of the assessment year. The income verification form must be prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue. An eligible resident who has filed a form for a previous year need not file a new form until there is a change in status affecting the person's eligibility.(7) In determining the true and fair value of a home for the aging for purposes of the partial exemption provided by subsection (3) of this section, the assessor must apply the computation method provided by RCW 84.34.060 and may consider only the use to which such property is applied during the years for which such partial exemptions are available and may not consider potential uses of such property.(8) As used in this section:(a) \"Eligible resident\" means a person who:(i) Occupied the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of December 31st of the first assessment year the home becomes operational. In each subsequent year, the eligible resident must occupy the dwelling unit as a principal place of residence as of January 1st of the assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. Confinement of the person to a hospital or nursing home does not disqualify the claim of exemption if the dwelling unit is temporarily unoccupied or if the dwelling unit is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; and(ii) Is sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or is, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability as defined in RCW 84.36.383. Any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death qualifies if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is fifty-seven years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; and(iii) Has a combined disposable income of no more than the greater of twenty-two thousand dollars or eighty percent of the median income adjusted for family size as most recently determined by the federal department of housing and urban development for the county in which the person resides. For the purposes of determining eligibility under this section, a \"cotenant\" means a person who resides with an eligible resident and who shares personal financial resources with the eligible resident.(b) \"Combined disposable income\" means the disposable income of the person submitting the income verification form, plus the disposable income of his or her spouse or domestic partner, and the disposable income of each cotenant occupying the dwelling unit for the preceding calendar year, less amounts paid by the person submitting the income verification form or his or her spouse or domestic partner or cotenant during the previous year for the treatment or care of either person received in the dwelling unit or in a nursing home. If the person submitting the income verification form was retired for two months or more of the preceding year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by twelve. If the income of the person submitting the income verification form is reduced for two or more months of the preceding year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or domestic partner, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after the death of the spouse or domestic partner by twelve.(c) \"Disposable income\" means adjusted gross income as defined in the federal internal revenue code, as amended prior to January 1, 1989, or such subsequent date as the director may provide by rule consistent with the purpose of this section, plus all of the following items to the extent they are not included in or have been deducted from adjusted gross income:(i) Capital gains, other than gain excluded from income under section 121 of the federal internal revenue code to the extent it is reinvested in a new principal residence;(ii) Amounts deducted for loss;(iii) Amounts deducted for depreciation;(iv) Pension and annuity receipts;(v) Military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;(vi) Veterans benefits other than attendant-care and medical-aid payments;(vii) Federal social security act and railroad retirement benefits;(viii) Dividend receipts; and(ix) Interest received on state and municipal bonds.(d) \"Resident requiring assistance with activities of daily living\" means a person who requires significant assistance with the activities of daily living and who would be at risk of nursing home placement without this assistance.(e) \"Home for the aging\" means a residential housing facility that (i) provides a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, the resident's guardian or conservator, or another responsible person; (ii) has only residents who are at least sixty-one years of age or who have needs for care generally compatible with persons who are at least sixty-one years of age; and (iii) provides varying levels of care and supervision, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.(9) A for-profit home for the aging that converts to nonprofit status after June 11, 1992, and would otherwise be eligible for tax exemption under this section may not receive the tax exemption until five years have elapsed since the conversion. The exemption must then be ratably granted over the next five years.\n\n(1) All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and:\n\n(a) At least fifty percent of the occupied dwelling units in the home are occupied by eligible residents; or\n\n(b) The home is subsidized under a federal department of housing and urban development program. The department of revenue must provide by rule a definition of homes eligible for exemption under this subsection (1)(b), consistent with the purposes of this section.\n\n(2) All real and personal property used by a nonprofit home for the aging that is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the home is exempt from taxation if the benefit of the exemption inures to the home and the construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, or refinancing of the home is financed under a program using bonds exempt from federal income tax if at least seventy-five percent of the total amount financed uses the tax exempt bonds and the financing program requires the home to reserve a percentage of all dwelling units so financed for low-income residents.

However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:(i) The residence is temporarily unoccupied;(ii) The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or(iii) The residence is rented for the purpose of paying nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home costs.(b) For the purpose of this subsection (1), \"relative\" means any individual related to the claimant by blood, marriage, or adoption;(2) The person claiming the exemption must have owned, at the time of filing, in fee, as a life estate, or by contract purchase, the residence on which the property taxes have been imposed or if the person claiming the exemption lives in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, such person must own a share therein representing the unit or portion of the structure in which he or she resides. For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;(3)(a) The person claiming the exemption must be:(i) Sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability; or(ii) A veteran of the armed forces of the United States entitled to and receiving compensation from the United States department of veterans affairs at:(A) A combined service-connected evaluation rating of 40 percent or higher; or(B) A total disability rating for a service-connected disability without regard to evaluation percent.(b) However, any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is 57 years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this section;(4)(a) The amount that the person is exempt from an obligation to pay is calculated on the basis of combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383.(b) If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months or more of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by 12.(c) If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by 12.(d)(i) If the income of the person claiming the exemption increases as a result of a cost-of-living adjustment to social security benefits or supplemental security income in an amount that would disqualify the applicant from eligibility, the applicant is not disqualified but instead maintains eligibility.(ii) The continued eligibility under this subsection applies to applications for property taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2024.(e) If it is necessary to estimate income to comply with this subsection (4), the assessor may require confirming documentation of such income prior to May 31st of the year following application;(5)(a) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 3 is exempt from all excess property taxes, the additional state property tax imposed under RCW 84.52.065(2), and the portion of the regular property taxes authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and approved by the voters, if the legislative authority of the county or city imposing the additional regular property taxes identified this exemption in the ordinance placing the RCW 84.55.050 measure on the ballot; and(b)(i) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 2 but greater than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of $50,000 or 35 percent of the valuation of his or her residence, but not to exceed $70,000 of the valuation of his or her residence; or(ii) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of $60,000 or 60 percent of the valuation of his or her residence;(6)(a) For a person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 3, the valuation of the residence is the assessed value of the residence on the later of January 1, 1995, or January 1st of the assessment year the person first qualifies under this section. If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used upon requalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person requalifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a different residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption.(b) In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year.(c) This subsection does not apply to subsequent improvements to the property in the year in which the improvements are made.

For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;\n\n(3)(a) The person claiming the exemption must be:\n\n(i) Sixty-one years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the exemption claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability; or\n\n(ii) A veteran of the armed forces of the United States entitled to and receiving compensation from the United States department of veterans affairs at:\n\n(A) A combined service-connected evaluation rating of 40 percent or higher; or\n\n(B) A total disability rating for a service-connected disability without regard to evaluation percent.\n\n(b) However, any surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a person who was receiving an exemption at the time of the person's death will qualify if the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is 57 years of age or older and otherwise meets the requirements of this section;\n\n(4)(a) The amount that the person is exempt from an obligation to pay is calculated on the basis of combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383.\n\n(b) If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months or more of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by 12.\n\n(c) If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by 12.\n\n(d)(i) If the income of the person claiming the exemption increases as a result of a cost-of-living adjustment to social security benefits or supplemental security income in an amount that would disqualify the applicant from eligibility, the applicant is not disqualified but instead maintains eligibility.\n\n(ii) The continued eligibility under this subsection applies to applications for property taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2024.\n\n(e) If it is necessary to estimate income to comply with this subsection (4), the assessor may require confirming documentation of such income prior to May 31st of the year following application;\n\n(5)(a) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 3 is exempt from all excess property taxes, the additional state property tax imposed under RCW 84.52.065(2), and the portion of the regular property taxes authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and approved by the voters, if the legislative authority of the county or city imposing the additional regular property taxes identified this exemption in the ordinance placing the RCW 84.55.050 measure on the ballot; and\n\n(b)(i) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 2 but greater than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of $50,000 or 35 percent of the valuation of his or her residence, but not to exceed $70,000 of the valuation of his or her residence; or\n\n(ii) A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of $60,000 or 60 percent of the valuation of his or her residence;\n\n(6)(a) For a person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 3, the valuation of the residence is the assessed value of the residence on the later of January 1, 1995, or January 1st of the assessment year the person first qualifies under this section. If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used upon requalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person requalifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a different residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption.\n\n(b) In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year.\n\n(c) This subsection does not apply to subsequent improvements to the property in the year in which the improvements are made. Subsequent improvements to the property must be added to the value otherwise determined under this subsection at their true and fair value in the year in which they are made.\n\n[ 2025 c 200 s 1; 2023 c 147 s 1; 2019 c 453 s 1; 2018 c 46 s 2; 2017 3rd sp.s. c 13 s 311; 2015 3rd sp.s. c 30 s 2; 2012 c 10 s 73; 2011 c 174 s 105; 2010 c 106 s 306; 2008 c 6 s 706; 2005 c 248 s 2; 2004 c 270 s 1; 1998 c 333 s 1; 1996 c 146 s 1; 1995 1st sp.s. c 8 s 1; 1994 sp.s. c 8 s 1; 1993 c 178 s 1; 1992 c 187 s 1.

If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply.\n\n[ 2023 c 147 s 3; 2021 c 145 s 24; 2020 c 209 s 2; 2019 c 453 s 3; 2011 c 174 s 106; 2010 c 106 s 308; 2001 c 185 s 8; 1992 c 206 s 13; 1988 c 222 s 10; 1983 1st ex.s. c 11 s 6; 1983 1st ex.s. c 11 s 3; 1979 ex.s. c 214 s 3; 1977 ex.s. c 268 s 2; 1974 ex.s. c 182 s 3.]\n\nTax preference performance statement exemption—Automatic expiration date exemption—2023 c 147: See note following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nTax preference performance statement exemption—Automatic expiration date exemption—2023 c 147: See note following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nAutomatic expiration date and tax preference performance statement exemption—2020 c 209: See note following RCW 84.36.387.\n\nAutomatic expiration date and tax preference performance statement exemption—2020 c 209: See note following RCW 84.36.387.\n\nApplication—Automatic expiration date and tax preference performance statement exemption—2019 c 453: See notes following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nApplication—Automatic expiration date and tax preference performance statement exemption—2019 c 453: See notes following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nEffective date—2010 c 106: See note following RCW 35.102.145.\n\nEffective date—2010 c 106: See note following RCW 35.102.145.\n\nApplication—2001 c 185 ss 1-12: See note following RCW 84.14.110.\n\nApplication—2001 c 185 ss 1-12: See note following RCW 84.14.110.\n\nEffective date—1992 c 206: See note following RCW 82.04.170.\n\nEffective date—1992 c 206: See note following RCW 82.04.170.\n\nIntent—Applicability—Effective dates—1983 1st ex.s. c 11:See notes following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nIntent—Applicability—Effective dates—1983 1st ex.s. c 11:See notes following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nApplicability—1979 ex.s. c 214: See note following RCW 84.36.381.\n\nApplicability—1979 ex.s. c 214: See note following RCW 84.36.381.",
