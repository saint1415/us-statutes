The department may not require the provisions of the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW, to be met as a condition of issuing a permit under this subsection.\n\n(15)(a) For any property, except for property located on a marine shoreline, that has experienced at least two consecutive years of flooding or erosion that has damaged or has threatened to damage a major structure, water supply system, septic system, or access to any road or highway, the county legislative authority may determine that a chronic danger exists. The county legislative authority shall notify the department, in writing, when it determines that a chronic danger exists. In cases of chronic danger, the department shall issue a permit, upon request, for work necessary to abate the chronic danger by removing any obstructions, repairing existing structures, restoring banks, restoring road or highway access, protecting fish resources, or protecting property. Permit requests must be made and processed in accordance with subsections (2) and (7) of this section.\n\n(b) Any projects proposed to address a chronic danger identified under (a) of this subsection that satisfies the project description identified in RCW 77.55.181(1)(a)(ii) are not subject to the provisions of the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW. However, the project is subject to the review process established in RCW 77.55.181(3) as if it were a fish habitat improvement project.\n\n(16) The department may issue an expedited written permit in those instances where normal permit processing would result in significant hardship for the applicant or unacceptable damage to the environment.

The purpose of this act is to take immediate action to facilitate the review and approval of fish habitat enhancement projects, to encourage efforts that will continue to improve the process in the future, to address known fish passage barriers immediately, and to develop over time a comprehensive system to inventory and prioritize barriers on a statewide basis.\" [ 1998 c 249 s 1.]\n\nJoint aquatic resource permit application form—Modification—1998 c 249: \"The department of ecology permit assistant [assistance] center shall immediately modify the joint aquatic resource permit application form to incorporate the permit process established in section 3 of this act.\" [ 1998 c 249 s 2.]\n\nJoint aquatic resource permit application form—Modification—1998 c 249: \"The department of ecology permit assistant [assistance] center shall immediately modify the joint aquatic resource permit application form to incorporate the permit process established in section 3 of this act.\" [ 1998 c 249 s 2.]\n\nFinding—Report—1998 c 249: \"The legislature finds that, while the process created in this act can improve the speed with which fish habitat enhancement projects are put into place, additional efforts can improve the review and approval process for the future.
