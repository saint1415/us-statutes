For many of these stocks there have been no recent stock assessments, or the current assessments are based on poor data.

The release of pheasants for hunting purposes must not conflict with or supplant other department efforts to improve upland bird habitat or naturally produced upland birds.\n\nThere is created within the department the eastern Washington pheasant enhancement program. The purpose of the program is to improve the harvest of pheasants by releasing pen-reared rooster pheasants on sites accessible for public hunting and by providing grants for habitat enhancement on public or private lands under agreement with the department. The department may either purchase rooster pheasants from private contractors, or produce rooster pheasants from department-sanctioned cooperative projects, whichever is less expensive, provided that the pheasants released meet minimum department standards for health and maturity. Any surplus hen pheasants from pheasant farms or projects operated by the department or the department of corrections for this enhancement program shall be made available to landowners who voluntarily open their lands to public pheasant hunting.
