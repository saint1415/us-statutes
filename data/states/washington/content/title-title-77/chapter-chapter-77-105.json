Investments made in recreational fishing programs will repay the people of the state many times over in increased economic activity and in an improved quality of life.(3) It is the intent of the legislature to improve recreational fishing opportunities in Puget Sound and Lake Washington from current levels and increase the economic benefits from the fishery, particularly recognizing the unique recreational experience provided by the winter salmon fishery. In addition, the legislature has determined that the number of angler trips expended in these waters is the measure of fishing opportunity.\n\n(1) The legislature finds the sheltered waters of Puget Sound (waters east of the Sekiu river) have historically provided the citizens of the state with the safest and most convenient access to productive marine recreational fishing.\n\n(2) The legislature further recognizes the economic value in restoring and rebuilding the recreational fishing opportunities in Puget Sound for salmon and marine bottomfish, and that these opportunities have declined in the past two decades.
