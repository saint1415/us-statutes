Each commissioner may delegate in writing from time to time to a deputy the power to be present and participate, including voting as his representative or substitute, at any meeting of or hearing by or other proceeding of the commission.Voting powers under this compact shall be limited to one vote for each state regardless of the number of representatives.ARTICLE IV.The duty of the said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell, and anadromous in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean over which the states signatory to this compact jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions and said conservation zones to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the signatory parties hereto.To that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislative branches of the various signatory states hereto legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the signatory states jointly or separately now have or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction. The commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislative branch in any state signatory hereto, present to the governor of such state its recommendations relating to enactments by the legislative branch of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.The commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable and which lie within the jurisdiction of such agencies.The commission shall have power to recommend to the states signatory hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with marine, shell, or anadromous fish and fish eggs or joint stocking by some or all of such states and when two or more of the said states shall jointly stock waters the commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.ARTICLE V.The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure, remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business.

      "text": "RCW 77.75.070\n\nWildlife violator compact—Established.\n\nThe wildlife violator compact is hereby established in the form substantially as follows, and the Washington state department of fish and wildlife is authorized to enter into such compact on behalf of the state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein:ARTICLE IFINDINGS, DECLARATION OFPOLICY, AND PURPOSE(a) The party states find that:(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.(2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.(3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:(i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or(ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or(iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.(10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.(b) It is the policy of the party states to:(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.(3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.(4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.(c) The purpose of this compact is to:(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.ARTICLE IIDEFINITIONSUnless the context requires otherwise, the definitions in this article apply through this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact:(a) \"Citation\" means any summons, complaint, ticket, penalty assessment, or other official document issued by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation containing an order which requires the person to respond.(b) \"Collateral\" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation.(c) \"Compliance\" with respect to a citation means the act of answering the citation through appearance at a court, a tribunal, or payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any, or both such appearance and payment.(d) \"Conviction\" means a conviction, including any court conviction, of any offense related to the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of wildlife which is prohibited by state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule, or a forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, or payment of a penalty assessment, or a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a deferred or suspended sentence by the court.(e) \"Court\" means a court of law, including Magistrate's Court and the Justice of the Peace Court.(f) \"Home state\" means the state of primary residence of a person.(g) \"Issuing state\" means the party state which issues a wildlife citation to the violator.(h) \"License\" means any license, permit, or other public document which conveys to the person to whom it was issued the privilege of pursuing, possessing, or taking any wildlife regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule of a party state.(i) \"Licensing authority\" means the department or division within each party state which is authorized by law to issue or approve licenses or permits to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.(j) \"Party state\" means any state which enacts legislation to become a member of this wildlife compact.(k) \"Personal

If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any party state thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.ARTICLE XITITLEThis compact shall be known as the wildlife violator compact.\n\nThe wildlife violator compact is hereby established in the form substantially as follows, and the Washington state department of fish and wildlife is authorized to enter into such compact on behalf of the state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein:\n\nFINDINGS, DECLARATION OF\n\nPOLICY, AND PURPOSE\n\n(a) The party states find that:\n\n(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.\n\n(2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.\n\n(3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.\n\n(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.\n\n(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.\n\n(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.\n\n(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:\n\n(i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or\n\n(ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or\n\n(iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.\n\n(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.\n\n(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.\n\n(10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.\n\n(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.\n\n(b) It is the policy of the party states to:\n\n(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.\n\n(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.\n\n(3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.\n\n(4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.\n\n(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.\n\n(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.\n\n(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.\n\n(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.\n\n(c) The purpose of this compact is to:\n\n(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.\n\n(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nUnless the context requires otherwise, the definitions in this article apply through this compact and are intended only for the implementation of this compact:\n\n(a) \"Citation\" means any summons, complaint, ticket, penalty assessment, or other official document issued by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation containing an order which requires the person to respond.\n\n(b) \"Collateral\" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an

fish and shellfish as defined by statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule in a party state.
