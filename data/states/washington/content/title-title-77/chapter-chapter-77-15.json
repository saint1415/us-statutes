Furthermore, laws defining crimes involving fish and wildlife have evolved over many years of changing uses and management objectives for fish and wildlife. The resulting two codes make it difficult for citizens to comply with the law and unnecessarily complicate enforcement of laws against violators.The legislature intends by chapter 190, Laws of 1998 to revise and recodify the criminal laws governing fish and wildlife, ensuring that all people involved with fish and wildlife are able to know and understand the requirements of the laws and the risks of violation. Additionally, the legislature intends to create a more uniform approach to criminal laws governing fish and wildlife and to the laws authorizing prosecution, sentencing, and punishments, including repealing crimes that are redundant to other provisions of the criminal code.Chapter 190, Laws of 1998 is not intended to alter existing powers of the commission or the director to adopt rules or exercise powers over fish and wildlife. In some places reference is made to violation of department rules, but this is intended to conform with current powers of the commission, director, or both, to adopt rules governing fish and wildlife activities.\n\nThe legislature finds that merger of the departments of fisheries and wildlife resulted in two criminal codes applicable to fish and wildlife, and that it has become increasingly difficult to administer and enforce the two criminal codes.

In particular, the legislature intends to protect southern resident orcas from those boaters who intentionally harass, chase, and torment the whales.(2) The legislature further finds that the state has a compelling interest in protecting the iconic southern resident orca from extinction by acting to implement recovery activities and adaptively managing the southern resident orca recovery effort using best available science. Studies conducted by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration have indicated that southern resident orcas significantly reduced their foraging behavior when moving vessels were observed within 1,000 yards of the whale, with females being more likely than males to reduce their foraging activities when vessels were within an average of 400 yards.(3) In 2019, the governor's southern resident orca task force produced 49 recommendations to address the three major threats to the population's recovery. While many investments have been made and implementation is ongoing, increased and sustained efforts are needed to advance salmon recovery, address water quality and contaminants in the environment, and reduce underwater noise and physical disturbance of orcas as they attempt to forage, communicate, and rest.(4) The legislature finds that the threats to orcas are interrelated and they are inexorably linked with salmon recovery. Salmon face a diverse array of threats throughout their life cycle including the threat posed by pinnipeds, such as seals and sea lions, which are protected under federal law, but nevertheless pose a significant threat to salmon and orca recovery through ongoing and excessive predation. Salmon also face fish passage barriers, stormwater runoff, and spills from wastewater treatment plants, among other threats. It is in the best interest of all the people of Washington, including federally recognized tribes and private landowners, to increase the population of salmon and to ensure the survivability of salmon against all threats.(5) The legislature directed the department of fish and wildlife to produce a report on the effectiveness of regulations designed to address underwater noise and disturbance from commercial whale watching and recreational vessels. The legislature received the first of three mandated reports in November of 2022, and it contained an assessment of the most recent science demonstrating the negative impact of vessels on southern resident orca foraging behavior and foraging success.(6) While it takes time to see results from efforts to increase prey availability and reduce contaminants, reducing noise and disturbance from vessels can provide immediate support for the southern resident orcas by increasing their likelihood of successful foraging.\" [ 2023 c 452 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2023 c 452: \"(1) It is the intent of the legislature to support the recovery of endangered southern resident orcas by reducing underwater noise and disturbance from vessels, which is one of the three main threats to the population's recovery, along with availability of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon, and contaminants in their food and environment.

Studies conducted by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration have indicated that southern resident orcas significantly reduced their foraging behavior when moving vessels were observed within 1,000 yards of the whale, with females being more likely than males to reduce their foraging activities when vessels were within an average of 400 yards.\n\n(3) In 2019, the governor's southern resident orca task force produced 49 recommendations to address the three major threats to the population's recovery. While many investments have been made and implementation is ongoing, increased and sustained efforts are needed to advance salmon recovery, address water quality and contaminants in the environment, and reduce underwater noise and physical disturbance of orcas as they attempt to forage, communicate, and rest.\n\n(4) The legislature finds that the threats to orcas are interrelated and they are inexorably linked with salmon recovery. Salmon face a diverse array of threats throughout their life cycle including the threat posed by pinnipeds, such as seals and sea lions, which are protected under federal law, but nevertheless pose a significant threat to salmon and orca recovery through ongoing and excessive predation. Salmon also face fish passage barriers, stormwater runoff, and spills from wastewater treatment plants, among other threats. It is in the best interest of all the people of Washington, including federally recognized tribes and private landowners, to increase the population of salmon and to ensure the survivability of salmon against all threats.\n\n(5) The legislature directed the department of fish and wildlife to produce a report on the effectiveness of regulations designed to address underwater noise and disturbance from commercial whale watching and recreational vessels. The legislature received the first of three mandated reports in November of 2022, and it contained an assessment of the most recent science demonstrating the negative impact of vessels on southern resident orca foraging behavior and foraging success.\n\n(6) While it takes time to see results from efforts to increase prey availability and reduce contaminants, reducing noise and disturbance from vessels can provide immediate support for the southern resident orcas by increasing their likelihood of successful foraging.\" [ 2023 c 452 s 1.]\n\nEffective date—2019 c 291 s 1: \"Section 1 of this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately [May 8, 2019].\" [ 2019 c 291 s 6.]\n\nEffective date—2019 c 291 s 1: \"Section 1 of this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately [May 8, 2019].\" [ 2019 c 291 s 6.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2008 c 225: \"The legislature finds that the resident population of orca whales in Washington waters (Orcinus orca), commonly referred to as the southern residents, are enormously significant to the state. These highly social, intelligent, and playful marine mammals, which the legislature designated as the official marine mammal of the state of Washington, serve as a symbol of the Pacific Northwest and illustrate the biological diversity and rich natural heritage that all Washington citizens and its visitors enjoy.However, the legislature also finds that the southern resident orcas are currently in a serious decline. Southern residents experienced an almost twenty percent decline between 1996 and 2001. The federal government listed this orca population as depleted in 2003, and as an endangered species in 2005. The federal government has identified impacts from vessels as a significant threat to these marine mammals.In 2006, after listing the southern resident orcas as endangered, the federal government designated critical orca habitat and released a proposed recovery plan for the southern resident orcas. The federal government has initiated the process to adopt orca conservation rules, but this process may be lengthy. Additionally, although existing whale and wildlife viewing guidelines are an excellent educational resource, these guidelines are voluntary measures that cannot be enforced.Therefore, the legislature intends to protect southern resident orca whales from impacts from vessels, and to educate the public on how to reduce the risk of disturbing these important marine mammals.\" [ 2008 c 225 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2008 c 225: \"The legislature finds that the resident population of orca whales in Washington waters (Orcinus orca), commonly referred to as the southern residents, are enormously significant to the state.
