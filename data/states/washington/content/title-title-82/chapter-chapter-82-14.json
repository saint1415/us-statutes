The tax is in addition to other taxes authorized by law and is collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the city. The tax may only be imposed by a city if:(a) The city legislative authority determines by resolution or ordinance that the projected cost to provide municipal services to the annexation area exceeds the projected general revenue that the city would otherwise receive from the annexation area on an annual basis; and(b) The city, as provided in RCW 35A.14.472, 35A.14.296, or 35.13.470, has entered into an interlocal agreement with the county regarding the proposed annexation area.(2) The tax authorized under this section is a credit against the state tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW. The department of revenue must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the city at no cost to the city and must remit the tax to the city as provided in RCW 82.14.060.(3) The maximum rate of tax any city may impose under this section is:(a) 0.1 percent for each annexed area in which the population is greater than 2,000 and less than 10,000; and(b) 0.2 percent for an annexed area in which the population is greater than 10,000.(4) The maximum cumulative rate of tax a city may impose under subsection (3) of this section is 0.2 percent for the total number of annexed areas the city may annex.(5) The tax imposed by this section may only be imposed at the beginning of a fiscal year and may continue for no more than 10 years from the date that each increment of the tax is first imposed. Tax rate increases due to additional annexed areas are effective on July 1st of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the annexation occurred, provided that notice is given to the department as set forth in subsection (9) of this section.(6) All revenue collected under this section may be used solely to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area.(7) The revenues from the tax authorized in this section may not exceed that which the city deems necessary to generate revenue equal to the difference between the city's cost to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area and the general revenues that the cities would otherwise expect to receive from the annexation during a year. If the revenues from the tax authorized in this section and the revenues from the annexation area exceed the costs to the city to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area during a given year, the city must notify the department and the tax distributions authorized in this section must be suspended for the remainder of the year.(8) No tax may be imposed under this section before July 1, 2023. Before imposing a tax under this section, the legislative authority of a city must adopt an ordinance that includes the following:(a) A certification that the amount needed to provide municipal services to the annexed area reflects the city's true and actual costs;(b) The rate of tax under this section that is imposed within the city; and(c) The threshold amount for the first fiscal year following the annexation and passage of the ordinance.(9) The tax must cease to be distributed to the city for the remainder of the fiscal year once the threshold amount has been reached. No later than March 1st of each year, the city must provide the department with a certification of the city's true and actual costs to provide municipal services to the annexed area, a new threshold amount for the next fiscal year, and notice of any applicable tax rate changes. Distributions of tax under this section must begin again on July 1st of the next fiscal year and continue until the new threshold amount has been reached or June 30th, whichever is sooner. Any revenue generated by the tax in excess of the threshold amount belongs to the state of Washington. Any amount resulting from the threshold amount less the total fiscal year distributions, as of June 30th, may not be carried forward to the next fiscal year.(10) The resident population of the annexation area must be determined in accordance with chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW.(11) A city may not begin to impose the tax authorized by this section after July 1, 2028.(12) The following definitions apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:(a) \"Annexation area\" means an area that has been annexed to a city under chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW. \"Annexation area\" includes all territory described in the city resolution.(b) \"Commenced annexation\" means the initiation of annexation proceedings has taken place under the direct petition method or the election method under chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW.(c) \"Department\" means the department of revenue.(d) \"Municipal services\" means those services customarily provided to the public by city government.(e) \"Fiscal year\" means the year beginning July 1st and ending the following June 30th.(f) \"Potential annexation area\" means one or more geographic areas that a city has officially designated for potential future annexation, as part of its comprehensive plan adoption process under the state growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW.(g) \"Threshold amount\" means the maximum amount of tax distributions as determined by the city in accordance with subsection (7) of this section that the department must distribute to the city generated from the tax imposed under this section in a fiscal year.\n\n(1) The legislative authority of any city that annexes an area consistent with its comprehensive plan required by chapter 36.70A RCW may impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. The tax is in addition to other taxes authorized by law and is collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the city.

The department of revenue must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the city at no cost to the city and must remit the tax to the city as provided in RCW 82.14.060.\n\n(3) The maximum rate of tax any city may impose under this section is:\n\n(a) 0.1 percent for each annexed area in which the population is greater than 2,000 and less than 10,000; and\n\n(b) 0.2 percent for an annexed area in which the population is greater than 10,000.\n\n(4) The maximum cumulative rate of tax a city may impose under subsection (3) of this section is 0.2 percent for the total number of annexed areas the city may annex.\n\n(5) The tax imposed by this section may only be imposed at the beginning of a fiscal year and may continue for no more than 10 years from the date that each increment of the tax is first imposed. Tax rate increases due to additional annexed areas are effective on July 1st of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the annexation occurred, provided that notice is given to the department as set forth in subsection (9) of this section.\n\n(6) All revenue collected under this section may be used solely to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area.\n\n(7) The revenues from the tax authorized in this section may not exceed that which the city deems necessary to generate revenue equal to the difference between the city's cost to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area and the general revenues that the cities would otherwise expect to receive from the annexation during a year. If the revenues from the tax authorized in this section and the revenues from the annexation area exceed the costs to the city to provide, maintain, and operate municipal services for the annexation area during a given year, the city must notify the department and the tax distributions authorized in this section must be suspended for the remainder of the year.\n\n(8) No tax may be imposed under this section before July 1, 2023. Before imposing a tax under this section, the legislative authority of a city must adopt an ordinance that includes the following:\n\n(a) A certification that the amount needed to provide municipal services to the annexed area reflects the city's true and actual costs;\n\n(b) The rate of tax under this section that is imposed within the city; and\n\n(c) The threshold amount for the first fiscal year following the annexation and passage of the ordinance.\n\n(9) The tax must cease to be distributed to the city for the remainder of the fiscal year once the threshold amount has been reached. No later than March 1st of each year, the city must provide the department with a certification of the city's true and actual costs to provide municipal services to the annexed area, a new threshold amount for the next fiscal year, and notice of any applicable tax rate changes. Distributions of tax under this section must begin again on July 1st of the next fiscal year and continue until the new threshold amount has been reached or June 30th, whichever is sooner. Any revenue generated by the tax in excess of the threshold amount belongs to the state of Washington. Any amount resulting from the threshold amount less the total fiscal year distributions, as of June 30th, may not be carried forward to the next fiscal year.\n\n(10) The resident population of the annexation area must be determined in accordance with chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW.\n\n(11) A city may not begin to impose the tax authorized by this section after July 1, 2028.\n\n(12) The following definitions apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\n(a) \"Annexation area\" means an area that has been annexed to a city under chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW. \"Annexation area\" includes all territory described in the city resolution.\n\n(b) \"Commenced annexation\" means the initiation of annexation proceedings has taken place under the direct petition method or the election method under chapter 35.13 or 35A.14 RCW.\n\n(c) \"Department\" means the department of revenue.\n\n(d) \"Municipal services\" means those services customarily provided to the public by city government.\n\n(e) \"Fiscal year\" means the year beginning July 1st and ending the following June 30th.\n\n(f) \"Potential annexation area\" means one or more geographic areas that a city has officially designated for potential future annexation, as part of its comprehensive plan adoption process under the state growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW.\n\n(g) \"Threshold amount\" means the maximum amount of tax distributions as determined by the city in accordance with subsection (7) of this section that the department must distribute to the city generated from the tax imposed under this section in a fiscal year.\n\n[ 2023 c 351 s 2; 2016 c 5 s 1; 2011 c 353 s 10; 2009 c 550 s 1; 2006 c 361 s 1.]\n\nIntent—2011 c 353: See note following RCW 36.70A.130.\n\nIntent—2011 c 353: See note following RCW 36.70A.130.\n\nSeverability—2006 c 361: \"If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.\" [ 2006 c 361 s 2.]\n\nSeverability—2006 c 361: \"If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.\" [ 2006 c 361 s 2.]",

Except as provided in this section, the tax is in addition to other taxes authorized by law and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the taxing jurisdiction of the city, town, or county. The rate of tax may not exceed the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1) in the case of a sales tax or a use tax, less the aggregate rates of any other taxes imposed on the same events that are credited against the state taxes imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW. The tax rate may be no higher than what is reasonably necessary for the local government to receive its entire annual state contribution in a ten-month period of time.(2) The tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section must be deducted from the amount of tax otherwise required to be collected or paid over to the department under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW. The department must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the city, town, or county at no cost to the city, town, or county.(3) No tax may be imposed under this section before July 1, 2007. Before imposing a tax under this section, the city, town, or county shall first have received tax allocation revenues during the preceding calendar year. The tax imposed under this section expires on the earlier of the date: (a) The tax allocation revenues are no longer used for public improvements and public improvement costs; (b) the bonds issued to finance or refinance the improvements are no longer outstanding, if the bonds are issued; or (c) that is thirty years after the tax is first imposed.(4) An ordinance adopted by the legislative authority of a city, town, or county imposing a tax under this section must provide that:(a) The tax is first imposed on the first day of a fiscal year;(b) The amount of tax received by the local government in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount of the state contribution;(c) The tax must cease to be distributed for the remainder of any fiscal year in which either:(i) The amount of tax distributions totals the amount of the state contribution;(ii) The amount of tax distributions totals the amount of local public sources, dedicated in the previous calendar year to finance public improvements authorized under chapter 39.100 RCW, expended in the previous year for public improvement costs, or used to pay for other bonds issued to pay for public improvements.

Except as provided in this section, the tax is in addition to other taxes authorized by law and is collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the taxing jurisdiction of the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government.(2) The tax authorized under subsection (1) of this section is credited against the state taxes imposed under RCW 82.08.020(1) and 82.12.020 at the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1). The department must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government at no cost to the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government and must remit the taxes as provided in RCW 82.14.060.(3) The aggregate rate of tax imposed by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, must not exceed the lesser of:(a) The rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1) less:(i) The aggregate rates of all other local sales and use taxes imposed by any taxing authority on the same taxable events;(ii) The aggregate rates of all taxes under RCW 82.14.465 and this section that are authorized to be imposed on the same taxable events but have not yet been imposed by a sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government that has been approved by the department or the community economic revitalization board to receive a state contribution under chapter 39.100 or 39.102 RCW; and(iii) The percentage amount of distributions required under RCW 82.08.020(5) multiplied by the rate of state taxes imposed under RCW 82.08.020(1); and(b) The rate, as determined by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, in consultation with the department, reasonably necessary to receive the state contribution over ten months.(4) Sponsoring local governments that have been approved before October 1, 2008, by the community economic revitalization board for a state contribution must select the rate of tax under this section no later than September 1, 2009.(5) The department, upon request, must assist a sponsoring local government and cosponsoring local government in establishing their tax rate in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Once the rate of tax is selected, it may not be increased.(6)(a) No tax may be imposed under the authority of this section:(i) Before July 1st of the second calendar year following the year approval by the board under RCW 39.102.040 was made; and(ii) Until a sponsoring local government reports to the board and the department as required by RCW 39.102.140 that the state has benefited through the receipt of state excise tax allocation revenues or state property tax allocation revenues, or both.(b) The tax imposed under this section expires when all indebtedness issued under the authority of RCW 39.102.150 is retired and all other contractual obligations relating to the financing of public improvements under chapter 39.102 RCW are satisfied, but not more than twenty-five years after the tax is first imposed.(7) An ordinance adopted by the legislative authority of a sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government imposing a tax under this section must provide that:(a) The tax is first imposed on the first day of a fiscal year;(b) The cumulative amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount of the state contribution;(c) The tax will cease to be distributed for the remainder of any fiscal year in which either:(i) The amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, equals the amount of the state contribution;(ii) The amount of revenue from taxes imposed under this section by all sponsoring and cosponsoring local governments equals the annual state contribution limit; or(iii) The amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government equals the amount of project award granted in the approval notice described in RCW 39.102.040;(d) Neither the local excise tax allocation revenues nor the local property tax allocation revenues may constitute more than eighty percent of the total local funds as described in *RCW 39.102.020(29)(b).

Determinations by the department of the amount of tax distributions attributable to each sponsoring or cosponsoring local government are final and may not be used to challenge the validity of any tax imposed under this section. The department must remit any tax receipts in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (7)(c) of this section to the state treasurer who must deposit the money in the general fund.(10) If a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government fails to comply with RCW 39.102.140, no tax may be distributed in the subsequent fiscal year until such time as the sponsoring or cosponsoring local government complies and the department calculates the state contribution amount for such fiscal year.(11) Each year, the amount of taxes approved by the department for distribution to a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government in the next fiscal year must be equal to the state contribution and may be no more than the total local funds as described in *RCW 39.102.020(29)(b). The department must consider information from reports described in RCW 39.102.140 when determining the amount of state contributions for each fiscal year. The department's determination of the amount of the state contribution is final and conclusive, and may not be changed once such determination is made and such contribution is distributed to the sponsoring or cosponsoring local government, unless the department subsequently determines that local revenue information contained in a report described in RCW 39.102.140 differs from the actual dedicated local revenue. If a discrepancy is found, the department must adjust its determination accordingly. A sponsoring or cosponsoring local government may not receive, in any fiscal year, more revenues from taxes imposed under the authority of this section than the amount approved annually by the department. The department may not approve the receipt of more distributions of sales and use tax under this section to a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government than is authorized under subsection (7) of this section.(12) The amount of tax distributions received from taxes imposed under the authority of this section by all sponsoring and cosponsoring local governments is limited annually to not more than seven million five hundred thousand dollars.(13) The definitions in RCW 39.102.020 apply to this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(14) If a sponsoring local government is a federally recognized Indian tribe, the distribution of the sales and use tax authorized under this section must be authorized through an interlocal agreement pursuant to chapter 39.34 RCW.(15) Subject to RCW 39.102.195, the tax imposed under the authority of this section may be applied either to provide for the payment of debt service on bonds issued under RCW 39.102.150 by the sponsoring local government or to pay public improvement costs on a pay-as-you-go basis, or both.(16) The tax imposed under the authority of this section must cease to be imposed if the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government fails to commence construction on public improvements by June 30, 2017.(17) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:(a) \"Local sales and use taxes\" means sales and use taxes imposed by cities, counties, public facilities districts, and other local governments under the authority of this chapter, chapter 67.28 or ** 67.40 RCW, or any other chapter, and that are credited against the state sales and use taxes.(b) \"State sales and use taxes\" means the tax imposed in RCW 82.08.020(1) and the tax imposed in RCW 82.12.020 at the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1).(18) This section expires June 30, 2044.\n\n(1) A sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, that has been approved by the board to use local infrastructure financing may impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter and subject to the criteria set forth in this section.

Once the rate of tax is selected, it may not be increased.\n\n(6)(a) No tax may be imposed under the authority of this section:\n\n(i) Before July 1st of the second calendar year following the year approval by the board under RCW 39.102.040 was made; and\n\n(ii) Until a sponsoring local government reports to the board and the department as required by RCW 39.102.140 that the state has benefited through the receipt of state excise tax allocation revenues or state property tax allocation revenues, or both.\n\n(b) The tax imposed under this section expires when all indebtedness issued under the authority of RCW 39.102.150 is retired and all other contractual obligations relating to the financing of public improvements under chapter 39.102 RCW are satisfied, but not more than twenty-five years after the tax is first imposed.\n\n(7) An ordinance adopted by the legislative authority of a sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government imposing a tax under this section must provide that:\n\n(a) The tax is first imposed on the first day of a fiscal year;\n\n(b) The cumulative amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount of the state contribution;\n\n(c) The tax will cease to be distributed for the remainder of any fiscal year in which either:\n\n(i) The amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, equals the amount of the state contribution;\n\n(ii) The amount of revenue from taxes imposed under this section by all sponsoring and cosponsoring local governments equals the annual state contribution limit; or\n\n(iii) The amount of tax received by the sponsoring local government equals the amount of project award granted in the approval notice described in RCW 39.102.040;\n\n(d) Neither the local excise tax allocation revenues nor the local property tax allocation revenues may constitute more than eighty percent of the total local funds as described in *RCW 39.102.020(29)(b). This requirement applies beginning January 1st of the fifth calendar year after the calendar year in which the sponsoring local government begins allocating local excise tax allocation revenues under RCW 39.102.110;\n\n(e) The tax must be distributed again, should it cease to be distributed for any of the reasons provided in (c) of this subsection, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, subject to the restrictions in this section; and\n\n(f) Any revenue generated by the tax in excess of the amounts specified in (c) of this subsection belongs to the state of Washington.\n\n(8) If a county and city cosponsor a revenue development area, the combined amount of distributions received by both the city and county may not exceed the state contribution.\n\n(9) The department must determine the amount of tax receipts distributed to each sponsoring local government, and any cosponsoring local government, imposing sales and use tax under this section and shall advise a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government when tax distributions for the fiscal year equal the amount of state contribution for that fiscal year as provided in subsection (11) of this section. Determinations by the department of the amount of tax distributions attributable to each sponsoring or cosponsoring local government are final and may not be used to challenge the validity of any tax imposed under this section. The department must remit any tax receipts in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (7)(c) of this section to the state treasurer who must deposit the money in the general fund.\n\n(10) If a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government fails to comply with RCW 39.102.140, no tax may be distributed in the subsequent fiscal year until such time as the sponsoring or cosponsoring local government complies and the department calculates the state contribution amount for such fiscal year.\n\n(11) Each year, the amount of taxes approved by the department for distribution to a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government in the next fiscal year must be equal to the state contribution and may be no more than the total local funds as described in *RCW 39.102.020(29)(b). The department must consider information from reports described in RCW 39.102.140 when determining the amount of state contributions for each fiscal year. The department's determination of the amount of the state contribution is final and conclusive, and may not be changed once such determination is made and such contribution is distributed to the sponsoring or cosponsoring local government, unless the department subsequently determines that local revenue information contained in a report described in RCW 39.102.140 differs from the actual dedicated local revenue. If a discrepancy is found, the department must adjust its determination accordingly. A sponsoring or cosponsoring local government may not receive, in any fiscal year, more revenues from taxes imposed under the authority of this section than the amount approved annually by the department. The department may not approve the receipt of more distributions of sales and use tax under this section to a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government than is authorized under subsection (7) of this section.\n\n(12) The amount of tax distributions received from taxes imposed under the authority of this section by all sponsoring and cosponsoring local governments is limited annually to not more than seven million five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n(13) The definitions in RCW 39.102.020 apply to this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n\n(14) If a sponsoring local government is a federally recognized Indian tribe, the distribution of the sales and use tax authorized under this section must be authorized through an interlocal agreement pursuant to chapter 39.34 RCW.\n\n(15) Subject to RCW 39.102.195, the tax imposed under the authority of this section may be applied either to provide for the payment of debt service on bonds issued under RCW 39.102.150 by the sponsoring local government or to pay public improvement costs on a pay-as-you-go basis, or both.\n\n(16) The tax imposed under the authority of this section must cease to be imposed if the sponsoring local government or cosponsoring local government fails to commence construction on public improvements by June 30, 2017.\n\n(17) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(a) \"Local sales and use taxes\" means sales and use taxes imposed by cities, counties, public facilities districts, and other local governments under the authority of this chapter, chapter 67.28 or ** 67.40 RCW, or any other chapter, and that are credited against the state sales and use taxes.\n\n(b) \"State sales and use taxes\" means the tax imposed in RCW 82.08.020(1) and the tax imposed in RCW 82.12.020 at the rate provided in RCW 82.08.020(1).\n\n(18) This section expires June 30, 2044.\n\n[ 2013 2nd sp.s. c 21 s 3; 2010 c 164 s 12; 2009 c 267 s 8; 2007 c 229 s 8; 2006 c 181 s 401.]\n\nReviser's note: *(1) RCW 39.102.020 was amended by 2020 c 280 s 2, changing subsection (29)(b) to subsection (30)(b).**(2) A majority of chapter 67.40 RCW was repealed by 2010 1st sp.s. c 15 s 14, effective November 30, 2010.
