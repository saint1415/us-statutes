These revenues help the state meet its paramount duty to amply provide every child in the state with an education, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. Revenues generated by this act will support health care and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, including behavioral health services for those living with mental illness or substance use disorder, as well as supervision of individuals who have committed crimes. These revenues will also fund social services that provide critical, basic needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents, including support for those with developmental disabilities and long-term care for the elderly.Furthermore, the legislature finds that the state's tax code must be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that tax policy reflects our modern economy. The legislature recognizes that our state and nation have moved away from a predominantly goods-based economy towards a more service-based economy. As a result, Washington's tax code, which is heavily reliant on sales taxes, continues to reach a narrowing share of economic activity subject to the retail sales tax. Similar to the marketplace fairness act of 2017, which extended retail sales tax to remote retailers with no physical presence in the state to ensure the tax code reflected the growing shift of retail sales toward online sales and away from brick-and-mortar stores located in the state, so too must this legislature consider extending the retail sales tax to computer-related services, as well as remove exemptions to the retail sales tax for digital automated services which have not been updated since 2009, and other services to which it is more appropriate to apply retail sales tax in the state's current economy. The legislature further recognizes that taxes on tobacco products, which have largely gone unchanged over the last several decades, do not adequately capture new and emerging nicotine products. As certain new products come onto the market, they are exempt from excise tax, creating an unfair advantage in the market against their competitors.Thus, to help meet the state's paramount duty of amply providing every child in the state with an education and to support the health and well-being of Washingtonians, the legislature intends to modernize the sales tax and taxes on nicotine products by extending retail sales tax to select services, repealing certain sales tax exemptions, applying taxes on tobacco to new nicotine products, and requiring certain large businesses to make a one-time prepayment of state sales tax collections.\" [ 2025 c 422 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2025 c 422: \"The legislature finds that, through the state's general fund, the state funds public schools, health care, and social services that help Washingtonians to succeed and thrive.

For these reasons, the legislature adopts single factor sales apportionment for purposes of apportioning royalty income and certain service income for state business and occupation tax purposes.\n\n(c) Nothing in this act may be construed, however, to authorize apportionment of the gross income or value of products taxable under the following business and occupation tax classifications: Retailing, wholesaling, manufacturing, processing for hire, extracting, extracting for hire, printing, government contracting, public road construction, the classifications in RCW 82.04.280(1) (b), (d), (f), and (g), and any other activity not specifically included in the definition of apportionable activities in RCW 82.04.460.\n\n(d) Nothing in this part is intended to modify the nexus and apportionment requirements for local gross receipts business and occupation taxes.\" [ 2011 c 174 s 208; 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 101.]\n\nContingency—Application—2010 1st sp.s. c 23 ss 102-112: See notes following RCW 82.04.067.\n\nContingency—Application—2010 1st sp.s. c 23 ss 102-112: See notes following RCW 82.04.067.\n\nEffective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: See note following RCW 82.04.4292.\n\nEffective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: See note following RCW 82.04.4292.",

The legislature further finds that the economic hardship wrought by this digital transformation has been substantial. The legislature finds that a strong and vibrant newspaper industry in Washington is beneficial to the state's citizens and to the conduct of good government at every level. The legislature further finds that advertising revenue of all United States newspapers fell from 63.5 billion dollars in 2000 to about twenty-three billion dollars in 2013, and is still falling. The legislature further finds that traditional news organizations' ability to support high quality news gathering and reporting relied primarily on a model in which advertisers paid to reach mass audiences attracted by newspapers. The legislature further finds that advertisers found it advantageous to pay to reach a mass audience because other advertising mediums were limited and less effective. The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission. The legislature also finds that the business and occupation tax rate for the newspaper industry was pegged to the general manufacturing and wholesaling rate from 1937 until 2009, when the legislature extended tax relief to the industry due to this shift. It is the legislature's intent to extend this tax relief to the industry until its revenues and business model have stabilized. It is the legislature's further intent to provide a uniform tax rate for the industry to minimize the burden of reporting state business and occupation taxes for different types of revenue, which oftentimes are impossible to account for separately by the taxpayer.(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the newspaper tax preferences in section 602 of this act. The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference.

As a secondary public policy objective, it is the legislature's intent to provide a permanent uniform rate for the industry.(d) To measure the effectiveness of the preference provided in this act in achieving the specific public policy objective described in (c) of this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate year-to-year changes in gross revenue derived from all sources for newspaper firms claiming the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.260(14). If the average year-to-year change in gross revenue is positive, including the last three years included in the tax preference review by the joint legislative audit and review committee, it is the legislature's intent to allow the tax preference to expire and to reinstate the traditional rate of 0.484 percent.(e)(i) The information provided in the annual tax preference accountability report submitted by taxpayers as required by the department of revenue and taxpayer data provided by the department of revenue is intended to provide the informational basis for the evaluation under (d) of this subsection.(ii) In addition to the data source described under (e)(i) of this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary in performing the evaluation under (d) of this subsection.\" [ 2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 s 601.]\n\nFindings—Intent—Tax preference performance statement—2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 s 602: \"(1) The legislature finds that over the last fifteen years, technological transformation and other developments have radically changed the newspaper industry business model, which remains in transition.

The exemptions result in nearly $200,000,000,000 of taxpayer savings for the current biennium. The legislature acknowledges that certain tax preferences, such as the sales and use tax exemption for food and the working families tax credit, are intended to rebalance Washington's tax code for working people. However, the legislature further acknowledges that many existing tax preferences are the result of private interests securing preferential tax treatment.(2) For that reason, the legislature enacted robust tax preference performance measures to create greater tax preference transparency and accountability and provide a framework for legislators to make informed decisions on the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. To ensure tax exemptions meet certain public policy objectives, the joint legislative audit and review committee, a nonpartisan legislative agency, routinely evaluates tax preferences based on specific criteria provided in law and reports that information to the legislature each year. The reports provide accurate, comprehensive, unbiased data that policymakers may use to determine if a tax preference should be continued, modified, or repealed. Additionally, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences is responsible for selecting which tax preferences are reviewed each year and provides comment on the legislative auditor's reports. Both entities provide recommendations to the legislature on the effectiveness of a tax preference in meeting certain performance measures.(3) Furthermore, the department of revenue assists in the tax preference evaluation process by collecting data from taxpayer beneficiaries and regularly reviewing changes in state and federal law. The analysis by the department and legislative auditor often reveals that a tax exemption is legally obsolete, meaning the specific legal conditions that existed when the exemption was enacted have since changed and the original legislative intent is no longer applicable. Additionally, some tax exemptions are simply not used and should be removed from the tax code to create better clarity for taxpayers.(4) The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that provides sustainable and ample funding for public schools, health care, and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services that provide critical, basic-needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents. The legislature further recognizes that the tax preference performance review process provides an opportunity for policymakers to evaluate the tax code to ensure the state is not losing essential revenue due to inefficient or no longer applicable tax exemptions.(5) Thus, the legislature intends to enact recommendations from the joint legislative audit and review committee, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, and the department of revenue, including eliminating several obsolete tax preferences, clarifying legislative intent to better inform future tax preference performance reviews, adding expiration dates, and other actions aimed at creating a fair and balanced tax system.\" [ 2025 c 423 s 1.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2025 c 423: \"(1) The legislature finds that, according to the most recent tax exemption study published by the department of revenue, there are currently 786 tax exemptions for the major state and local tax sources in Washington.

The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission.

If the average year-to-year change in gross revenue is positive, including the last three years included in the tax preference review by the joint legislative audit and review committee, it is the legislature's intent to allow the tax preference to expire and to reinstate the traditional rate of 0.484 percent.\n\n(e)(i) The information provided in the annual tax preference accountability report submitted by taxpayers as required by the department of revenue and taxpayer data provided by the department of revenue is intended to provide the informational basis for the evaluation under (d) of this subsection.\n\n(ii) In addition to the data source described under (e)(i) of this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary in performing the evaluation under (d) of this subsection.\" [ 2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 s 601.]\n\nEffective dates—2015 3rd sp.s. c 6: See note following RCW 82.04.4266.\n\nEffective dates—2015 3rd sp.s. c 6: See note following RCW 82.04.4266.\n\nTax preference performance statement—2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 ss 202-205: See note following RCW 82.04.4266.\n\nTax preference performance statement—2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 ss 202-205: See note following RCW 82.04.4266.\n\nContingent effective date—2014 c 140 s 6: \"Section 6 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015, subject to the contingency stated in section 2, chapter 2, Laws of 2013 3rd sp. sess.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 39.]\n\nContingent effective date—2014 c 140 s 6: \"Section 6 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015, subject to the contingency stated in section 2, chapter 2, Laws of 2013 3rd sp. sess.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 39.]\n\nContingent expiration date—2014 c 140 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act expires July 1, 2015, subject to the contingency stated in section 2, chapter 2, Laws of 2013 3rd sp. sess.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 38.]\n\nContingent expiration date—2014 c 140 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act expires July 1, 2015, subject to the contingency stated in section 2, chapter 2, Laws of 2013 3rd sp. sess.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 38.]\n\nEffective date—2014 c 140 s 4: \"Section 4 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 37.]\n\nEffective date—2014 c 140 s 4: \"Section 4 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 37.]\n\nExpiration date—2014 c 140 s 3: \"Section 3 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 36.]\n\nExpiration date—2014 c 140 s 3: \"Section 3 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2014 c 140 s 36.]\n\nEffective date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 6: \"Subject to section 2 of this act, section 6 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 16.]\n\nEffective date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 6: \"Subject to section 2 of this act, section 6 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 16.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 5: \"Subject to section 2 of this act, section 5 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 15.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 5: \"Subject to section 2 of this act, section 5 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 3rd sp.s. c 2 s 15.]\n\nContingent effective date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2: See RCW 82.32.850.\n\nContingent effective date—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2: See RCW 82.32.850.\n\nFindings—Intent—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2: See note following RCW 82.32.850.\n\nFindings—Intent—2013 3rd sp.s. c 2: See note following RCW 82.32.850.\n\nEffective date—2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 203: \"Section 203 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 1902.]\n\nEffective date—2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 203: \"Section 203 of this act takes effect July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 1902.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 202: \"Section 202 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 1901.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 202: \"Section 202 of this act expires July 1, 2015.\" [ 2013 2nd sp.s. c 13 s 1901.]\n\nIntent—2013 2nd sp.s. c 13: \"The intent of part II of this act is to incentivize the creation of additional jobs in Washington in the dairy industry and related industries that manufacture dairy-based products.

The exemptions result in nearly $200,000,000,000 of taxpayer savings for the current biennium. The legislature acknowledges that certain tax preferences, such as the sales and use tax exemption for food and the working families tax credit, are intended to rebalance Washington's tax code for working people. However, the legislature further acknowledges that many existing tax preferences are the result of private interests securing preferential tax treatment.(2) For that reason, the legislature enacted robust tax preference performance measures to create greater tax preference transparency and accountability and provide a framework for legislators to make informed decisions on the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. To ensure tax exemptions meet certain public policy objectives, the joint legislative audit and review committee, a nonpartisan legislative agency, routinely evaluates tax preferences based on specific criteria provided in law and reports that information to the legislature each year. The reports provide accurate, comprehensive, unbiased data that policymakers may use to determine if a tax preference should be continued, modified, or repealed. Additionally, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences is responsible for selecting which tax preferences are reviewed each year and provides comment on the legislative auditor's reports. Both entities provide recommendations to the legislature on the effectiveness of a tax preference in meeting certain performance measures.(3) Furthermore, the department of revenue assists in the tax preference evaluation process by collecting data from taxpayer beneficiaries and regularly reviewing changes in state and federal law. The analysis by the department and legislative auditor often reveals that a tax exemption is legally obsolete, meaning the specific legal conditions that existed when the exemption was enacted have since changed and the original legislative intent is no longer applicable. Additionally, some tax exemptions are simply not used and should be removed from the tax code to create better clarity for taxpayers.(4) The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that provides sustainable and ample funding for public schools, health care, and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services that provide critical, basic-needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents. The legislature further recognizes that the tax preference performance review process provides an opportunity for policymakers to evaluate the tax code to ensure the state is not losing essential revenue due to inefficient or no longer applicable tax exemptions.(5) Thus, the legislature intends to enact recommendations from the joint legislative audit and review committee, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, and the department of revenue, including eliminating several obsolete tax preferences, clarifying legislative intent to better inform future tax preference performance reviews, adding expiration dates, and other actions aimed at creating a fair and balanced tax system.\" [ 2025 c 423 s 1.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2025 c 423: \"(1) The legislature finds that, according to the most recent tax exemption study published by the department of revenue, there are currently 786 tax exemptions for the major state and local tax sources in Washington.

The legislature further finds that the economic hardship wrought by this digital transformation has been substantial. The legislature finds that a strong and vibrant newspaper industry in Washington is beneficial to the state's citizens and to the conduct of good government at every level. The legislature further finds that advertising revenue of all United States newspapers fell from 63.5 billion dollars in 2000 to about twenty-three billion dollars in 2013, and is still falling. The legislature further finds that traditional news organizations' ability to support high quality news gathering and reporting relied primarily on a model in which advertisers paid to reach mass audiences attracted by newspapers. The legislature further finds that advertisers found it advantageous to pay to reach a mass audience because other advertising mediums were limited and less effective. The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission. The legislature also finds that the business and occupation tax rate for the newspaper industry was pegged to the general manufacturing and wholesaling rate from 1937 until 2009, when the legislature extended tax relief to the industry due to this shift. It is the legislature's intent to extend this tax relief to the industry until its revenues and business model have stabilized. It is the legislature's further intent to provide a uniform tax rate for the industry to minimize the burden of reporting state business and occupation taxes for different types of revenue, which oftentimes are impossible to account for separately by the taxpayer.(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the newspaper tax preferences in section 602 of this act.

The legislature further finds that the economic hardship wrought by this digital transformation has been substantial. The legislature finds that a strong and vibrant newspaper industry in Washington is beneficial to the state's citizens and to the conduct of good government at every level. The legislature further finds that advertising revenue of all United States newspapers fell from 63.5 billion dollars in 2000 to about twenty-three billion dollars in 2013, and is still falling. The legislature further finds that traditional news organizations' ability to support high quality news gathering and reporting relied primarily on a model in which advertisers paid to reach mass audiences attracted by newspapers. The legislature further finds that advertisers found it advantageous to pay to reach a mass audience because other advertising mediums were limited and less effective. The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission. The legislature also finds that the business and occupation tax rate for the newspaper industry was pegged to the general manufacturing and wholesaling rate from 1937 until 2009, when the legislature extended tax relief to the industry due to this shift. It is the legislature's intent to extend this tax relief to the industry until its revenues and business model have stabilized. It is the legislature's further intent to provide a uniform tax rate for the industry to minimize the burden of reporting state business and occupation taxes for different types of revenue, which oftentimes are impossible to account for separately by the taxpayer.\n\n(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the newspaper tax preferences in section 602 of this act. The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.\n\n(b) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide temporary tax relief as described in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).\n\n(c) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide business and occupation tax relief to the newspaper industry as it continues to adjust to significant revenue shifts and technological changes.

The exemptions result in nearly $200,000,000,000 of taxpayer savings for the current biennium. The legislature acknowledges that certain tax preferences, such as the sales and use tax exemption for food and the working families tax credit, are intended to rebalance Washington's tax code for working people. However, the legislature further acknowledges that many existing tax preferences are the result of private interests securing preferential tax treatment.(2) For that reason, the legislature enacted robust tax preference performance measures to create greater tax preference transparency and accountability and provide a framework for legislators to make informed decisions on the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. To ensure tax exemptions meet certain public policy objectives, the joint legislative audit and review committee, a nonpartisan legislative agency, routinely evaluates tax preferences based on specific criteria provided in law and reports that information to the legislature each year. The reports provide accurate, comprehensive, unbiased data that policymakers may use to determine if a tax preference should be continued, modified, or repealed. Additionally, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences is responsible for selecting which tax preferences are reviewed each year and provides comment on the legislative auditor's reports. Both entities provide recommendations to the legislature on the effectiveness of a tax preference in meeting certain performance measures.(3) Furthermore, the department of revenue assists in the tax preference evaluation process by collecting data from taxpayer beneficiaries and regularly reviewing changes in state and federal law. The analysis by the department and legislative auditor often reveals that a tax exemption is legally obsolete, meaning the specific legal conditions that existed when the exemption was enacted have since changed and the original legislative intent is no longer applicable. Additionally, some tax exemptions are simply not used and should be removed from the tax code to create better clarity for taxpayers.(4) The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that provides sustainable and ample funding for public schools, health care, and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services that provide critical, basic-needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents. The legislature further recognizes that the tax preference performance review process provides an opportunity for policymakers to evaluate the tax code to ensure the state is not losing essential revenue due to inefficient or no longer applicable tax exemptions.(5) Thus, the legislature intends to enact recommendations from the joint legislative audit and review committee, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, and the department of revenue, including eliminating several obsolete tax preferences, clarifying legislative intent to better inform future tax preference performance reviews, adding expiration dates, and other actions aimed at creating a fair and balanced tax system.\" [ 2025 c 423 s 1.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2025 c 423: \"(1) The legislature finds that, according to the most recent tax exemption study published by the department of revenue, there are currently 786 tax exemptions for the major state and local tax sources in Washington.

The legislature further finds that the economic hardship wrought by this digital transformation has been substantial. The legislature finds that a strong and vibrant newspaper industry in Washington is beneficial to the state's citizens and to the conduct of good government at every level. The legislature further finds that advertising revenue of all United States newspapers fell from 63.5 billion dollars in 2000 to about twenty-three billion dollars in 2013, and is still falling. The legislature further finds that traditional news organizations' ability to support high quality news gathering and reporting relied primarily on a model in which advertisers paid to reach mass audiences attracted by newspapers. The legislature further finds that advertisers found it advantageous to pay to reach a mass audience because other advertising mediums were limited and less effective. The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission. The legislature also finds that the business and occupation tax rate for the newspaper industry was pegged to the general manufacturing and wholesaling rate from 1937 until 2009, when the legislature extended tax relief to the industry due to this shift. It is the legislature's intent to extend this tax relief to the industry until its revenues and business model have stabilized. It is the legislature's further intent to provide a uniform tax rate for the industry to minimize the burden of reporting state business and occupation taxes for different types of revenue, which oftentimes are impossible to account for separately by the taxpayer.(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the newspaper tax preferences in section 602 of this act. The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference.

The legislature further finds that the economic hardship wrought by this digital transformation has been substantial. The legislature finds that a strong and vibrant newspaper industry in Washington is beneficial to the state's citizens and to the conduct of good government at every level. The legislature further finds that advertising revenue of all United States newspapers fell from 63.5 billion dollars in 2000 to about twenty-three billion dollars in 2013, and is still falling. The legislature further finds that traditional news organizations' ability to support high quality news gathering and reporting relied primarily on a model in which advertisers paid to reach mass audiences attracted by newspapers. The legislature further finds that advertisers found it advantageous to pay to reach a mass audience because other advertising mediums were limited and less effective. The digital era has greatly fractured traditional spending by advertisers and turned this model on its head such that newspapers continue to require time to adapt so they may continue their public service mission. The legislature also finds that the business and occupation tax rate for the newspaper industry was pegged to the general manufacturing and wholesaling rate from 1937 until 2009, when the legislature extended tax relief to the industry due to this shift. It is the legislature's intent to extend this tax relief to the industry until its revenues and business model have stabilized. It is the legislature's further intent to provide a uniform tax rate for the industry to minimize the burden of reporting state business and occupation taxes for different types of revenue, which oftentimes are impossible to account for separately by the taxpayer.\n\n(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the newspaper tax preferences in section 602 of this act. The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.\n\n(b) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide temporary tax relief as described in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).\n\n(c) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide business and occupation tax relief to the newspaper industry as it continues to adjust to significant revenue shifts and technological changes.

For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), a service supports the performance of cleanup if it:\n\n(i) Is within the scope of work under a clean-up contract with the United States department of energy; or\n\n(ii) Assists in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy under a subcontract entered into with the prime contractor or another subcontractor in furtherance of a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor.\n\n(3) A service does not assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy if the same services are routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities, except that the following services are always deemed to contribute to the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy:\n\n(a) Information technology and computer support services;\n\n(b) Services rendered in respect to infrastructure; and\n\n(c) Security, safety, and health services.\n\n(4) The legislature intends that the examples provided in this subsection be used as a guideline when determining whether a service is \"routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities\" as that phrase is used in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(a) The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general accounting services but does apply to performance audits performed for persons cleaning up radioactive waste.\n\n(b) The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general legal services but does apply to those legal services that assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy. Thus, legal services provided to contest any local, state, or federal tax liability or to defend a company against a workers' compensation claim arising from a worksite injury do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification. But, legal services related to the resolution of a contractual dispute between the parties to a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor do qualify.\n\n(c) General office janitorial services do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification, but the specialized cleaning of equipment exposed to radioactive waste does qualify.\n\n[ 2025 c 420 s 105; 2009 c 469 s 202; 1996 c 112 s 3.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 420 ss 101-108 and 110-112: See note following RCW 82.04.230.\n\nEffective date—2025 c 420 ss 101-108 and 110-112: See note following RCW 82.04.230.\n\nTax preference performance statement exemption—Automatic expiration date exemption—Necessity of act—2025 c 420: See notes following RCW 82.04.230.\n\nTax preference performance statement exemption—Automatic expiration date exemption—Necessity of act—2025 c 420: See notes following RCW 82.04.230.\n\nFinding—Intent—2009 c 469: \"(1) The legislature finds that the cleaning up of radioactive waste at the Hanford site is crucial to the environment in this state.

For purposes of this subsection, a \"finance lease\" means a lease that meets two requirements:\n\n(I) It is the type of lease permitted to be made by national banks (see 12 U.S.C.

Part 225.25, as amended); and\n\n(II) It is the economic equivalent of an extension of credit, i.e., the lease is treated by the lessor as a loan for federal income tax purposes. In no event does a lease qualify as an extension of credit where the lessor takes depreciation on such property for federal income tax purposes.\n\n(B) For this classification to apply, the average of the gross income in the current tax year and immediately preceding two tax years must satisfy the more than 50 percent requirement;\n\n(x) Any other person or business entity, other than an insurance general agent taxable under RCW 82.04.280(1)(e), an insurance business exempt from the business and occupation tax under RCW 82.04.320, a real estate broker taxable under RCW 82.04.255, a securities dealer or international investment management company taxable under RCW 82.04.290(2), that receives more than 50 percent of its gross receipts from activities that a person described in (d)(ii) through (vii) and (ix) of this subsection is authorized to transact.\n\n(e)(i) \"Specified financial institution\" means a financial institution that is a member of a consolidated financial institution group that reported on its consolidated financial statement for the previous calendar year annual net income of at least $1,000,000,000, not including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as the terms \"net income\" and \"noncontrolling interest\" are used in the consolidated financial statement.\n\n(ii) If financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements, \"specified financial institution\" means any person that was subject to the additional tax in this section in at least two of the previous four calendar years.\n\n(3) The department must notify the fiscal committees of the legislature if financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements.\n\n(4) To aid in the effective administration of the additional tax imposed in this section, the department may require a person believed to be a specified financial institution to disclose whether it is a member of a consolidated financial institution group and, if so, to identify all other members of its consolidated financial institution group. A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.\n\n(5) Taxes collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.\n\n[ 2025 c 423 s 201; 2025 c 420 s 202; 2025 c 401 s 4; 2019 c 420 s 2.]\n\nReviser's note: This section was amended by 2025 c 401 s 4, 2025 c 420 s 202, and by 2025 c 423 s 201, without reference to one another.

The intent of the legislature in enacting this exemption was to provide a narrow exemption for out-of-state businesses engaged in direct sales of consumer products, typically accomplished through in-home parties or door-to-door selling.(2) In Dot Foods, Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, Docket No. 81022-2 (September 10, 2009), the Washington supreme court held that the exemption in RCW 82.04.423 applied to a taxpayer: (a) That sold nonconsumer products through its representative in addition to consumer products; and (b) whose consumer products were ultimately sold at retail in permanent retail establishments.(3) The legislature finds that most out-of-state businesses selling consumer products in this state will either be eligible for the exemption under RCW 82.04.423 or could easily restructure their business operations to qualify for the exemption. As a result, the legislature expects that the broadened interpretation of the direct sellers' exemption will lead to large and devastating revenue losses. This comes at a time when the state's existing budget is facing a two billion six hundred million dollar shortfall, which could grow, while at the same time the demand for state and state-funded services is also growing. Moreover, the legislature further finds that RCW 82.04.423 provides preferential tax treatment for out-of-state businesses over their in-state competitors and now creates a strong incentive for in-state businesses to move their operations outside Washington.(4) Therefore, the legislature finds that it is necessary to reaffirm the legislature's intent in establishing the direct sellers' exemption and prevent the loss of revenues resulting from the expanded interpretation of the exemption by amending RCW 82.04.423 retroactively to conform the exemption to the original intent of the legislature and by prospectively ending the direct sellers' exemption as of May 1, 2010.\" [ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 401.]\n\nIntent—Findings—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: \"(1) A business and occupation tax exemption is provided in RCW 82.04.423 for certain out-of-state sellers that sell consumer products exclusively to or through a direct seller's representative. The intent of the legislature in enacting this exemption was to provide a narrow exemption for out-of-state businesses engaged in direct sales of consumer products, typically accomplished through in-home parties or door-to-door selling.\n\n(2) In Dot Foods, Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, Docket No. 81022-2 (September 10, 2009), the Washington supreme court held that the exemption in RCW 82.04.423 applied to a taxpayer: (a) That sold nonconsumer products through its representative in addition to consumer products; and (b) whose consumer products were ultimately sold at retail in permanent retail establishments.\n\n(3) The legislature finds that most out-of-state businesses selling consumer products in this state will either be eligible for the exemption under RCW 82.04.423 or could easily restructure their business operations to qualify for the exemption. As a result, the legislature expects that the broadened interpretation of the direct sellers' exemption will lead to large and devastating revenue losses. This comes at a time when the state's existing budget is facing a two billion six hundred million dollar shortfall, which could grow, while at the same time the demand for state and state-funded services is also growing.

(Contingent effective date; contingent expiration date.)\n\n(1) Subject to the limits and provisions of this section, a credit is authorized against the tax otherwise due under RCW 82.04.241 for persons engaged in the business of manufacturing semiconductor materials. For the purposes of this section \"semiconductor materials\" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.04.241.(2)(a) The credit under this section equals $3,000 for each employment position used in manufacturing production that takes place in a new building exempt from sales and use tax under RCW 82.08.965 and 82.12.965. A credit is earned for the calendar year a person fills a position. Additionally a credit is earned for each year the position is maintained over the subsequent consecutive years, up to eight years. Those positions that are not filled for the entire year are eligible for 50 percent of the credit if filled less than six months, and the entire credit if filled more than six months.(b) To qualify for the credit, the manufacturing activity of the person must be conducted at a new building that qualifies for the exemption from sales and use tax under RCW 82.08.965 and 82.12.965.(c) In those situations where a production building in existence on the effective date of this section will be phased out of operation, during which time employment at the new building at the same site is increased, the person is eligible for credit for employment at the existing building and new building, with the limitation that the combined eligible employment not exceed full employment at the new building. \"Full employment\" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.965. The credit may not be earned until the commencement of commercial production, as that term is used in RCW 82.08.965.(3) No application is necessary for the tax credit.

The department must assess interest, but not penalties, on the taxes for which the person is not eligible. The interest must be assessed at the rate provided for delinquent excise taxes under chapter 82.32 RCW, is retroactive to the date the tax credit was taken, and accrues until the taxes for which a credit has been used are repaid.(5) A person claiming the credit under this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.(6) Credits may be claimed after the expiration date of this section, for those buildings at which commercial production began before the expiration date of this section, subject to all of the eligibility criteria and limitations of this section.(7) Any person who has claimed the credit under this section must reimburse the department for 50 percent of the amount of the tax preference under this section if the number of persons employed by the person claiming the tax preference is less than 90 percent of the person's three-year employment average for the three years immediately preceding the year in which the credit is claimed.(8) Pursuant to RCW 82.32.790, this section is contingent on the siting and commercial operation of a significant semiconductor microchip fabrication facility in the state of Washington.(9) This section expires January 1, 2034, unless the contingency in RCW 82.32.790(2) occurs.\n\n(1) Subject to the limits and provisions of this section, a credit is authorized against the tax otherwise due under RCW 82.04.241 for persons engaged in the business of manufacturing semiconductor materials.

In conducting its review under this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee should consider, among other data:\n\n(a) The number and aggregate amount of loans and investments originated under the program, including with revolved dollars;\n\n(b) Overall match, including project leverage, invested by grant recipients;\n\n(c) The balance sheet growth of community development financial institutions that received grants from the program;\n\n(d) Whether participants in the program achieved balance sheet growth during the time of their participation in the program;\n\n(e) The percentage of community development financial institutions in Washington that received funding from the program; and\n\n(f) The level of ongoing demand for funding from the program.\n\n(5) In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.\n\n(6) This section expires July 1, 2027.\" [ 2022 c 189 s 5.]",

Persons who are subject to tax under more than one of the tax classifications enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor for each tax classification that the person is taxable under.(2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the receipts factor is a fraction and is calculated as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section and, for financial institutions, as provided in the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2).(3)(a) The numerator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer attributable to this state during the tax year from engaging in an apportionable activity. The denominator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer from engaging in an apportionable activity everywhere in the world during the tax year.(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of computing the receipts factor, gross income of the business generated from each apportionable activity is attributable to the state:(i) Where the customer received the benefit of the taxpayer's service or, in the case of gross income from royalties, where the customer used the taxpayer's intangible property. When a customer receives the benefit of the taxpayer's services or uses the taxpayer's intangible property in this and one or more other states and the amount of gross income of the business that was received by the taxpayer in return for the services received or intangible property used by the customer in this state can be reasonably determined by the taxpayer, such amount of gross income must be attributed to this state.(ii) If the customer received the benefit of the service or used the intangible property in more than one state and if the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state in which the benefit of the service was primarily received or in which the intangible property was primarily used.(iii) If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state from which the customer ordered the service or, in the case of royalties, the office of the customer from which the royalty agreement with the taxpayer was negotiated.(iv) If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state to which the billing statements or invoices are sent to the customer by the taxpayer.(v) If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state from which the customer sends payment to the taxpayer.(vi) If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state where the customer is located as indicated by the customer's address: (A) Shown in the taxpayer's business records maintained in the regular course of business; or (B) obtained during consummation of the sale or the negotiation of the contract for services or for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property, including any address of a customer's payment instrument when readily available to the taxpayer and no other address is available.(vii) If the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the commercial domicile of the taxpayer.(viii) For purposes of this subsection (3)(b), \"customer\" means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise receives gross income of the business. \"Customer\" includes anyone who pays royalties or charges in the nature of royalties for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property.(c) Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the receipts factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in this state, and the gross income is attributable under (b) of this subsection (3) to a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), \"not taxable\" means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that state, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a state in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with that state under the standards in RCW 82.04.067(1) regardless of whether that state imposes such a tax. \"Business activities tax\" means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a state. The term includes taxes measured in whole or in part on net income or gross income or receipts. \"Business activities tax\" does not include a sales tax, use tax, or a similar transaction tax, imposed on the sale or acquisition of goods or services, whether or not denominated a gross receipts tax or a tax imposed on the privilege of doing business.(d) This subsection (3) does not apply to financial institutions with respect to apportionable income taxable under RCW 82.04.290. Financial institutions must calculate the receipts factor as provided in subsection (4) of this section and the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2) with respect to apportionable income taxable under RCW 82.04.290. Financial institutions that are subject to tax under any other tax classification enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (v) and (vii) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor, as provided in this section, for each of the other tax classifications that the financial institution is taxable under.(4) A taxpayer may calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on the most recent calendar year for which information is available for the full calendar year. If a taxpayer does not calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on previous calendar year information as authorized in this subsection, the business must use current year information to calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year. In either case, a taxpayer must correct the reporting for the current tax year when complete information is available to calculate the receipts factor for that year, but not later than October 31st of the following tax year. Interest will apply to any additional tax due on a corrected tax return. Interest must be computed and assessed as provided in RCW 82.32.050 and accrues until the additional taxes are paid. Penalties as provided in RCW 82.32.090 will apply to any such additional tax due only if the current tax year reporting is not corrected and the additional tax is not paid by October 31st of the following tax year. Interest as provided in RCW 82.32.060 will apply to any tax paid in excess of that properly due on a return as a result of a taxpayer using previous calendar year data or incomplete current-year data to calculate the receipts factor.(5) Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.(a) \"Apportionable activities\" and \"apportionable income\" have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.460.(b) \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any foreign country or political subdivision of a foreign country.\n\n(1) The apportionable income of a person within the scope of RCW 82.04.460(1) is apportioned to Washington by multiplying its apportionable income by the receipts factor. Persons who are subject to tax under more than one of the tax classifications enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor for each tax classification that the person is taxable under.\n\n(2) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the receipts factor is a fraction and is calculated as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section and, for financial institutions, as provided in the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2).\n\n(3)(a) The numerator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer attributable to this state during the tax year from engaging in an apportionable activity. The denominator of the receipts factor is the total gross income of the business of the taxpayer from engaging in an apportionable activity everywhere in the world during the tax year.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of computing the receipts factor, gross income of the business generated from each apportionable activity is attributable to the state:\n\n(i) Where the customer received the benefit of the taxpayer's service or, in the case of gross income from royalties, where the customer used the taxpayer's intangible property.

Financial institutions must calculate the receipts factor as provided in subsection (4) of this section and the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2) with respect to apportionable income taxable under RCW 82.04.290. Financial institutions that are subject to tax under any other tax classification enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (v) and (vii) through (x) must calculate a separate receipts factor, as provided in this section, for each of the other tax classifications that the financial institution is taxable under.\n\n(4) A taxpayer may calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on the most recent calendar year for which information is available for the full calendar year.

Washington state has lost more than two dozen weeklies and three dailies since 2004. The decline of these journalistic institutions represents a threat to democracy, government accountability, and civic engagement.\n\nA Portland State University study found that the loss of local journalism is correlated to a decline in civic engagement, both nationally and in Washington state, which includes contacting a public office to express an opinion, participating in school groups, community associations, or civic organizations, and serving on a committee of any group or organization.\n\nThe legislature finds that local journalism can help keep watch over health trends in the community by identifying and preventing disease. The legislature finds that rural and underserved communities are the hardest hit in the area of public health when newspapers decline.\n\nThe legislature finds that local journalism helps combat government corruption and holds powerful institutions accountable.\n\nNewspapers in Washington state have lobbied and editorialized for open public records, and fought attempts to rein in frivolous requests, costing local and state governments millions of dollars each year.\n\nWithout legislative action, the current business and occupation tax preference for newspaper publishers will expire on July 1, 2024.\" [ 2023 c 286 s 1.]\n\nEffective date—2023 c 286: \"This act takes effect January 1, 2024.\" [ 2023 c 286 s 8.]\n\nEffective date—2023 c 286: \"This act takes effect January 1, 2024.\" [ 2023 c 286 s 8.]\n\nExpiration date—2023 c 286: \"This act expires January 1, 2034.\" [ 2023 c 286 s 9.]\n\nExpiration date—2023 c 286: \"This act expires January 1, 2034.\" [ 2023 c 286 s 9.]",
