As an alternative to electronic funds transfer, the department may authorize other forms of electronic payment, such as payment by credit card. All taxes administered by this chapter are subject to this requirement, except that the department may exclude any taxes not reported on the combined excise tax return or any successor return from the electronic payment requirement in this subsection.(b) The department may waive the electronic payment requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.(c) The department is authorized to accept payment of taxes by electronic funds transfer or other acceptable forms of electronic payment from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic payment requirements in this subsection.(3)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, returns must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize.(b) The department may waive the electronic filing requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.(c) The department is authorized to allow electronic filing of returns from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic filing requirements in this subsection.(4)(a)(i) The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making and filing any return, and may grant such reasonable additional time within which to make and file returns as it may deem proper, but any permanent extension granting the taxpayer a reporting date without penalty more than ten days beyond the due date, and any extension in excess of thirty days must be conditional on deposit with the department of an amount to be determined by the department which is approximately equal to the estimated tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted. In the case of a permanent extension or a temporary extension of more than thirty days the deposit must be deposited within the state treasury with other tax funds and a credit recorded to the taxpayer's account which may be applied to taxpayer's liability upon cancellation of the permanent extension or upon reporting of the tax liability where an extension of more than thirty days has been granted.(ii) The department must review the requirement for deposit at least annually and may require a change in the amount of the deposit required when it believes that such amount does not approximate the tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted.(b) During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the department, on its own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the time for making or filing any return as the department deems proper. The department may not require any deposit as a condition for granting an extension under this subsection (4)(b).(5)(a) The department must keep full and accurate records of all funds received and disbursed by it. Subject to the provisions of RCW 82.32.105, 82.32.052, and 82.32.350, the department must apply the payment of the taxpayer in the following order, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer: (i) Interest; (ii) penalties; (iii) fees that are not within the definition of tax in RCW 82.32.020; (iv) other nontax amounts; (v) taxes, except spirits taxes; and (vi) spirits taxes.(b) For purposes of this subsection, \"spirits taxes\" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.155.(6) The department may refuse to accept any return that is not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon or that is not filed electronically as required in this section. When such return is not accepted, the taxpayer is deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and is subject to the procedures provided in RCW 82.32.100 and to the penalties provided in RCW 82.32.090. The above authority to refuse to accept a return may not apply when a return is timely filed electronically and a timely payment has been made by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment as authorized by the department.(7) Except for returns and remittances required to be transmitted to the department electronically under this section and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a return or remittance that is transmitted to the department by United States mail is deemed filed or received on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing it. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the department electronically is deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the department.(8)(a) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, \"good cause\" means the inability of a taxpayer to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section because:(i) The taxpayer does not have the equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section;(ii) The equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section is not functioning properly;(iii) The taxpayer does not have access to the internet using the taxpayer's own equipment;(iv) The taxpayer does not have a bank account or a credit card;(v) The taxpayer's bank is unable to send or receive electronic funds transfer transactions; or(vi) Some other circumstance or condition exists that, in the department's judgment, prevents the taxpayer from complying with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section.(b) \"Good cause\" also includes any circumstance that, in the department's judgment, supports the efficient or effective administration of the tax laws of this state, including providing relief from the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section to any taxpayer that is voluntarily collecting and remitting this state's sales or use taxes on sales to Washington customers but has no legal requirement to be registered with the department.\n\n(1) When authorized by the department, payment of the tax may be made by uncertified check under such rules as the department prescribes, but, if a check so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such check is tendered, will remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties and interest, the same as if such check had not been tendered.\n\n(2)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, payment of the tax must be made by electronic funds transfer, as defined in RCW 82.32.085. As an alternative to electronic funds transfer, the department may authorize other forms of electronic payment, such as payment by credit card. All taxes administered by this chapter are subject to this requirement, except that the department may exclude any taxes not reported on the combined excise tax return or any successor return from the electronic payment requirement in this subsection.\n\n(b) The department may waive the electronic payment requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.\n\n(c) The department is authorized to accept payment of taxes by electronic funds transfer or other acceptable forms of electronic payment from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic payment requirements in this subsection.\n\n(3)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, returns must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize.\n\n(b) The department may waive the electronic filing requirement in this subsection for any taxpayer or class of taxpayers, for good cause or for whom the department has assigned a reporting frequency that is less than quarterly. In the discretion of the department, a waiver under this subsection may be made temporary or permanent, and may be made on the department's own motion.\n\n(c) The department is authorized to allow electronic filing of returns from taxpayers that are not subject to the mandatory electronic filing requirements in this subsection.\n\n(4)(a)(i) The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making and filing any return, and may grant such reasonable additional time within which to make and file returns as it may deem proper, but any permanent extension granting the taxpayer a reporting date without penalty more than ten days beyond the due date, and any extension in excess of thirty days must be conditional on deposit with the department of an amount to be determined by the department which is approximately equal to the estimated tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted. In the case of a permanent extension or a temporary extension of more than thirty days the deposit must be deposited within the state treasury with other tax funds and a credit recorded to the taxpayer's account which may be applied to taxpayer's liability upon cancellation of the permanent extension or upon reporting of the tax liability where an extension of more than thirty days has been granted.\n\n(ii) The department must review the requirement for deposit at least annually and may require a change in the amount of the deposit required when it believes that such amount does not approximate the tax liability for the reporting period or periods for which the extension is granted.\n\n(b) During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the department, on its own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the time for making or filing any return as the department deems proper. The department may not require any deposit as a condition for granting an extension under this subsection (4)(b).\n\n(5)(a) The department must keep full and accurate records of all funds received and disbursed by it. Subject to the provisions of RCW 82.32.105, 82.32.052, and 82.32.350, the department must apply the payment of the taxpayer in the following order, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer: (i) Interest; (ii) penalties; (iii) fees that are not within the definition of tax in RCW 82.32.020; (iv) other nontax amounts; (v) taxes, except spirits taxes; and (vi) spirits taxes.\n\n(b) For purposes of this subsection, \"spirits taxes\" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.155.\n\n(6) The department may refuse to accept any return that is not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon or that is not filed electronically as required in this section. When such return is not accepted, the taxpayer is deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and is subject to the procedures provided in RCW 82.32.100 and to the penalties provided in RCW 82.32.090. The above authority to refuse to accept a return may not apply when a return is timely filed electronically and a timely payment has been made by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment as authorized by the department.\n\n(7) Except for returns and remittances required to be transmitted to the department electronically under this section and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a return or remittance that is transmitted to the department by United States mail is deemed filed or received on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing it. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the department electronically is deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the department.\n\n(8)(a) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, \"good cause\" means the inability of a taxpayer to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section because:\n\n(i) The taxpayer does not have the equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section;\n\n(ii) The equipment or software necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with subsection (2) or (3) of this section is not functioning properly;\n\n(iii) The taxpayer does not have access to the internet using the taxpayer's own equipment;\n\n(iv) The taxpayer does not have a bank account or a credit card;\n\n(v) The taxpayer's bank is unable to send or receive electronic funds transfer transactions; or\n\n(vi) Some other circumstance or condition exists that, in the department's judgment, prevents the taxpayer from complying with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section.\n\n(b) \"Good cause\" also includes any circumstance that, in the department's judgment, supports the efficient or effective administration of the tax laws of this state, including providing relief from the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section to any taxpayer that is voluntarily collecting and remitting this state's sales or use taxes on sales to Washington customers but has no legal requirement to be registered with the department.\n\n[ 2015 c 86 s 311; 2012 c 39 s 2.

The direct pay permit allows the taxpayer to accrue and remit directly to the department use tax on the acquisition of tangible personal property or sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services, in accordance with all of the applicable provisions of this title. Any taxpayer that uses a direct pay permit must remit state and local sales or use tax directly to the department. The agreement by the purchaser to remit tax directly to the department, rather than pay sales or use tax to the seller, relieves the seller of the obligation to collect sales or use tax and requires the buyer to pay use tax on the tangible personal property and sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services.(2)(a) A taxpayer may apply for a permit under this section if: (i) The taxpayer's cumulative tax liability is reasonably expected to be two hundred forty thousand dollars or more in the current calendar year; or (ii) the taxpayer makes purchases subject to the taxes imposed under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW in excess of ten million dollars per calendar year. For the purposes of this section, \"tax liability\" means the amount required to be remitted to the department for taxes administered under this chapter, except for the taxes imposed or authorized by chapters 82.14A, 82.14B, 82.24, 82.27, 82.29A, and 84.33 RCW.(b) Application for a permit must be made in writing to the director in a form and manner prescribed by the department. A taxpayer who transacts business in two or more locations may submit one application to cover the multiple locations.(c) The director must review a direct pay permit application in a timely manner and must notify the applicant, in writing, of the approval or denial of the application. The department must approve or deny an application based on the applicant's ability to comply with local government use tax coding capabilities and responsibilities; requirements for vendor notification; recordkeeping obligations; electronic data capabilities; and tax reporting procedures. Additionally, an application may be denied if the director determines that denial would be in the best interest of collecting taxes due under this title. The department must provide a direct pay permit to an approved applicant with the notice of approval. The direct pay permit must clearly state that the holder is solely responsible for the accrual and payment of the tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW and that the seller is relieved of liability to collect tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW on all sales to the direct pay permit holder. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a denial.(d) A taxpayer who uses a direct pay permit must continue to maintain records that are necessary to a determination of the tax liability in accordance with this title. A direct pay permit is not transferable and the use of a direct pay permit may not be assigned to a third party.(3) Taxes for which the direct pay permit is used are due and payable on the tax return for the reporting period in which the taxpayer (a) receives the tangible personal property purchased or in which the labor and/or services are performed or (b) receives an invoice for such property or such labor and/or services, whichever period is earlier.(4) The holder of a direct pay permit must furnish a copy of the direct pay permit to each vendor with whom the taxpayer has opted to use a direct pay permit. Sellers who make sales upon which the sales or use tax is not collected by reason of the provisions of this section, in addition to existing requirements under this title, must maintain a copy of the direct pay permit and any such records or information as the department may specify.(5) A direct pay permit is subject to revocation by the director at any time the department determines that the taxpayer has violated any provision of this section or that revocation would be in the best interests of collecting the taxes due under this title. The notice of revocation must be in writing and is effective either as of the end of the taxpayer's next normal reporting period or a date deemed appropriate by the director and identified in the revocation notice. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a revocation and reinstatement of the permit.(6) Any taxpayer who chooses to no longer use a direct pay permit or whose permit is revoked by the department, must return the permit to the department and immediately make a good faith effort to notify all vendors to whom the permit was given, advising them that the permit is no longer valid.(7) Except as provided in this subsection, the direct pay permit may be used for any purchase of tangible personal property and any retail sale under RCW 82.04.050. The direct pay permit may not be used for:(a) Purchases of meals or beverages;(b) Purchases of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other property subject to requirements for title transactions by the department of licensing;(c) Purchases for which a reseller permit or other documentation authorized under RCW 82.04.470 may be used;(d) Purchases that meet the definitions of *RCW 82.04.050 (2) (e) and (f), (3) (a) through (c), (e), (f), and (g), (5), and (15); or(e) Other activities subject to tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW that the department by rule designates, consistent with the purposes of this section, as activities for which a direct pay permit is not appropriate and may not be used.\n\n(1) The director may grant a direct pay permit to a taxpayer who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the director, that the taxpayer meets the requirements of this section.

      "text": "RCW 82.32.090\n\nLate payment—Disregard of written instructions—Evasion—Substantial underpayment—Penalties.\n\n(1) If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the department of revenue by the due date, there is assessed a penalty of nine percent of the amount of the tax; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 19 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the second month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 29 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than $5.(2) If the department of revenue determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 15 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the 30th day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than $5. As used in this section, \"substantially underpaid\" means that the taxpayer has paid less than 80 percent of the amount of tax determined by the department to be due for all of the types of taxes included in, and for the entire period of time covered by, the department's examination, and the amount of underpayment is at least $1,000.(3) If a warrant is issued by the department of revenue for the collection of taxes, increases, and penalties, there is added thereto a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax, but not less than $10.(4) If the department finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the department a registration certificate as required by RCW 82.32.030, the department must impose a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due from that person for the period that the person was not registered as required by RCW 82.32.030. The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a person who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.(5) If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of 45 days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.(6) If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of 35 percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.(7) If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of 50 percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.(8) The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (4) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.(9) The department may not impose the evasion penalty in combination with the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions or the penalty provided in subsection (6) of this section on the same tax found to be due.(10) If a taxpayer substantially underpays an estimated payment of tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040 pursuant to RCW 82.87.110(3), there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the actual tax due for tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040. As used in this section, \"substantially underpaid\" means that an individual's estimated payment for taxes imposed under RCW 82.87.040 was less than 80 percent of the actual tax due, and at least $1,000.(11) For the purposes of this section, \"return\" means any document a person is required by the state of Washington to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the department, and that has a statutorily defined due date. \"Return\" also includes the submission of any estimated payment of tax as provided in RCW 82.87.110(3) and the confirmation of an extension of the filing due date required under RCW 82.87.110(5).\n\n(1) If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the department of revenue by the due date, there is assessed a penalty of nine percent of the amount of the tax; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 19 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the second month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 29 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection.

Any rules adopted under this section must include examples of transactions that the department will disregard for tax purposes.\n\n(6) This section does not affect the department's authority to apply any other remedies available under statutory or common law.\n\n(7) For purposes of this section, \"affiliated\" means under common control. \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.\n\n[ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 201.]\n\nApplication—2010 1st sp.s. c 23 ss 201 and 202: \"Except as provided in section 202 of this act, section 201 of this act applies to tax periods beginning January 1, 2006.\" [ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 1703.]\n\nApplication—2010 1st sp.s. c 23 ss 201 and 202: \"Except as provided in section 202 of this act, section 201 of this act applies to tax periods beginning January 1, 2006.\" [ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 1703.]\n\nEffective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: \"Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect May 1, 2010.\" [ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 1708.]\n\nEffective date—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: \"Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect May 1, 2010.\" [ 2010 1st sp.s. c 23 s 1708.]\n\nFindings--Intent—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: See notes following RCW 82.04.220.\n\nFindings--Intent—2010 1st sp.s. c 23: See notes following RCW 82.04.220.",
