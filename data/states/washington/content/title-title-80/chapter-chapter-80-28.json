The grantee shall determine that the household income does not exceed the maximum allowed for eligibility under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance under 42 U.S.C. 8624 and shall provide a dollar figure that is seven percent of household income. The grantee may verify information provided in the self-certification;(c) Has applied for home heating assistance from applicable government and private sector organizations and certifies that any assistance received will be applied to the current bill and future utility bills;(d) Has applied for low-income weatherization assistance to the utility or other appropriate agency if such assistance is available for the dwelling;(e) Agrees to a payment plan and agrees to maintain the payment plan. The plan will be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following October 15th and to pay for continued utility service. If the past due bill is not paid by the following October 15, the customer is not eligible for protections under this chapter until the past due bill is paid. The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer's monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter during November 15 through March 15. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and(f) Agrees to pay the moneys owed even if the customer moves.(5) The utility shall:(a) Include in any notice that an account is delinquent and that service may be subject to termination, a description of the customer's duties in this section;(b) Assist the customer in fulfilling the requirements under this section;(c) Be authorized to transfer an account to a new residence when a customer who has established a plan under this section moves from one residence to another within the same utility service area;(d) Be permitted to disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program except on the days indicated in subsection (8) of this section.

The budget billing or equal payment plan shall be offered low-income customers eligible under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance prepared in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 8624(C)(1) without limiting availability to certain months of the year, without regard to the length of time the customer has occupied the premises, and without regard to whether the customer is the tenant or owner of the premises occupied.(8)(a) Every electrical company, water company, and thermal energy company must have and must abide by the terms of a tariff approved by the commission that prohibits the electrical company, water company, or thermal energy company from effecting, due to lack of payment, an involuntary termination of electric, water, or thermal energy utility service to any residential user, including tenants of metered apartment buildings and residents of mobile homes, on any day for which the national weather service has issued or has announced that it intends to issue a heat-related alert, such as an excessive heat warning, a heat advisory, an excessive heat watch, or a similar alert, for the area in which the residential user's address is located.(b) Nothing in this subsection (8) limits the authority of the commission to prohibit an electrical company, water company, or thermal energy company from terminating electric, water, or thermal energy utility service in accordance with an approved tariff, rule, or order, in circumstances independent of the weather.(9)(a) A residential user at whose dwelling electric, water, or thermal energy utility service has been disconnected for lack of payment may request that the utility reconnect service on any day for which the national weather service has issued or has announced that it intends to issue a heat-related alert, such as an excessive heat warning, a heat advisory, an excessive heat watch, or a similar alert, for the area in which the residential user's address is located. The utility shall, through a process approved by the commission, inform all customers in the notice of disconnection of the ability to seek reconnection and provide clear and specific information on how to make that request, including how to contact the utility.(b) Upon receipt of a request made pursuant to (a) of this subsection, the utility shall promptly make a reasonable attempt to reconnect service to the dwelling. The utility, in connection with a request made pursuant to (a) of this subsection, may require the residential user to enter into a payment plan prior to reconnecting service to the dwelling. If the utility requires the residential user to enter into a repayment plan, the repayment plan must comply with subsection (10) of this section.(10) A repayment plan required by a utility pursuant to subsection (9)(b) of this section will be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following May 15th, or as soon as possible after May 15th if needed to maintain monthly payments that are no greater than six percent of the customer's monthly income, and to pay for continued utility service.

The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer's monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter during November 15 through March 15. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and\n\n(f) Agrees to pay the moneys owed even if the customer moves.\n\n(5) The utility shall:\n\n(a) Include in any notice that an account is delinquent and that service may be subject to termination, a description of the customer's duties in this section;\n\n(b) Assist the customer in fulfilling the requirements under this section;\n\n(c) Be authorized to transfer an account to a new residence when a customer who has established a plan under this section moves from one residence to another within the same utility service area;\n\n(d) Be permitted to disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program except on the days indicated in subsection (8) of this section. Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than for nonpayment as provided for in this subsection. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected can be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by paying all amounts that would have been due and owing under the terms of the applicable payment plan, absent default, on the date on which service is reconnected; and\n\n(e) Advise the customer in writing at the time it disconnects service that it will restore service if the customer contacts the utility and fulfills the other requirements of this section.\n\n(6) A payment plan implemented under this section is consistent with RCW 80.28.080.\n\n(7) Every gas company, electrical company, and thermal energy company shall offer residential customers the option of a budget billing or equal payment plan. The budget billing or equal payment plan shall be offered low-income customers eligible under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance prepared in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 8624(C)(1) without limiting availability to certain months of the year, without regard to the length of time the customer has occupied the premises, and without regard to whether the customer is the tenant or owner of the premises occupied.\n\n(8)(a) Every electrical company, water company, and thermal energy company must have and must abide by the terms of a tariff approved by the commission that prohibits the electrical company, water company, or thermal energy company from effecting, due to lack of payment, an involuntary termination of electric, water, or thermal energy utility service to any residential user, including tenants of metered apartment buildings and residents of mobile homes, on any day for which the national weather service has issued or has announced that it intends to issue a heat-related alert, such as an excessive heat warning, a heat advisory, an excessive heat watch, or a similar alert, for the area in which the residential user's address is located.\n\n(b) Nothing in this subsection (8) limits the authority of the commission to prohibit an electrical company, water company, or thermal energy company from terminating electric, water, or thermal energy utility service in accordance with an approved tariff, rule, or order, in circumstances independent of the weather.\n\n(9)(a) A residential user at whose dwelling electric, water, or thermal energy utility service has been disconnected for lack of payment may request that the utility reconnect service on any day for which the national weather service has issued or has announced that it intends to issue a heat-related alert, such as an excessive heat warning, a heat advisory, an excessive heat watch, or a similar alert, for the area in which the residential user's address is located. The utility shall, through a process approved by the commission, inform all customers in the notice of disconnection of the ability to seek reconnection and provide clear and specific information on how to make that request, including how to contact the utility.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of a request made pursuant to (a) of this subsection, the utility shall promptly make a reasonable attempt to reconnect service to the dwelling. The utility, in connection with a request made pursuant to (a) of this subsection, may require the residential user to enter into a payment plan prior to reconnecting service to the dwelling. If the utility requires the residential user to enter into a repayment plan, the repayment plan must comply with subsection (10) of this section.\n\n(10) A repayment plan required by a utility pursuant to subsection (9)(b) of this section will be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following May 15th, or as soon as possible after May 15th if needed to maintain monthly payments that are no greater than six percent of the customer's monthly income, and to pay for continued utility service. The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of six percent of the customer's monthly income. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but will not be in default unless payment during this period is less than six percent of the customer's monthly income. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan.\n\n(11) Every gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, water company, and thermal energy company shall construct and maintain such facilities in connection with the manufacture and distribution of its product, or provision of its services, as will be efficient and safe to its employees and the public.\n\n(12) An agreement between the customer and the utility, whether oral or written, does not waive the protections afforded under this chapter.\n\n(13) In establishing rates or charges for water service, water companies as defined in RCW 80.04.010 may consider the achievement of water conservation goals and the discouragement of wasteful water use practices.\n\n(14) On an annual basis, each utility must submit a report to the commission that includes the total number of electric, water, or thermal energy disconnections that occurred on each day for which the national weather service issued, or announced that it intended to issue, a heat-related alert.\n\n[ 2025 c 263 s 4; 2023 c 105 s 6; 2011 c 214 s 11; 2008 c 299 s 35; 1995 c 399 s 211.

The receiver must report to the court and the commission its recommendations for the company's future operation of the system, including the formation of a water-sewer district or other public entity, or ownership by another existing wastewater company capable of providing service.(3) If a petition for receivership and verifying affidavit executed by an appropriate official allege an immediate and serious danger to residents constituting an emergency, the court must set the matter for hearing within three days and may appoint a temporary receiver ex parte upon the strength of such petition and affidavit pending a full evidentiary hearing, which must be held within fourteen days after receipt of the petition.(4) If the court imposes a bond upon a receiver, the amount must reasonably relate to the level of operating revenue generated by, and the capital value of, the wastewater company. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this section may not be held personally liable for any good faith, reasonable effort to assume possession of, and to operate, the system in compliance with the court's orders, subject to the provisions of law governing clean water as referenced by the commission by rule.(5) The court must authorize the receiver to impose reasonable assessments on the customers of the system of sewerage to recover expenditures for improvements necessary for the public health and safety.(6) The commission must develop a plan for transfer of the system of sewerage to a new operator and submit its plan to the court. The commission must develop the plan after notice to, and an opportunity to participate by, the receiver, the municipal corporations whose geographic boundaries, in whole or in part, include the system of sewerage at issue, and the public. The commission must complete the plan no later than twelve months after appointment of a receiver.(a) If the commission finds that no private entity is able or willing to take over the system of sewerage and decides the system of sewerage should be taken over by a municipal corporation whose geographic boundaries include the system of sewerage at issue, in whole or in part, the commission must provide its findings to the court and the court may issue an order to that effect. If the court orders a municipal corporation to take over the system of sewerage, the municipal corporation must promptly institute negotiations to purchase the system. If, within six months of the court's order, the negotiations fail or otherwise do not result in a purchase, the municipal corporation must promptly initiate a condemnation proceeding to acquire the system. The court must terminate the receivership once the purchase is complete.(b) If the commission decides the system of sewerage should be taken over by a private entity, such as an individual or business, the commission must provide its findings to the court and the court may issue an order to that effect. If the court orders a private entity to take over the system of sewerage, the private entity must promptly institute negotiations to purchase the system. If, within six months of the court's order, the negotiations fail or otherwise do not result in a purchase, the private entity must promptly exercise its power of eminent domain granted by the legislature in subsection (9) of this section to acquire the system. The court must terminate the receivership once the purchase is complete.(7) Other than pursuant to subsection (6)(a) and (b) of this section, the court may not terminate the receivership, and order the return of the system to the owners, unless the commission approves that action. The court may impose reasonable conditions upon the return of the system to the owner, including the posting of a bond or other security, routine performance and financial audits, employment of qualified operators and other staff or contracted services, compliance with financial viability requirements, or other measures sufficient to ensure the ongoing proper operation of the system.(8) If, as part of the ultimate disposition of the system, a condemnation proceeding is commenced to acquire the system of sewerage, the court shall oversee any appraisal of the system conducted under Title 7 RCW to assure that the appraised value properly reflects any reduced value because of the necessity to make improvements to the system. The court has the authority to approve the appraisal and to modify the appraisal based on any information provided at an evidentiary hearing. The court's determination of the proper value of the system, based on the appraisal, is final and only appealable if not supported by substantial evidence. If the appraised value is appealed, the court may order the system's ownership to be transferred upon payment of the approved appraised value.(9) The legislature grants any municipal corporation, and any private entity the power of eminent domain under the circumstances described in this section. However, a private entity must obtain authorization from the city, town, or county with jurisdiction over the subject property after the legislative authority of the city, town, or county has passed an ordinance requiring that property be taken for public use. This subsection does not limit eminent domain authority granted by any other provision of law.\n\n(1) The commission may petition the Thurston county superior court pursuant to chapter 7.60 RCW to place a wastewater company in receivership. The petition must include the names of one or more qualified candidates for receiver who have consented to assume operation of the system of sewerage. The petition must also include a list of interested and qualified individuals, municipal corporations, and wastewater companies with experience in providing wastewater service and a history of satisfactory operation of a system of sewerage. If no other entity is willing and able to be appointed as the receiver, the court must appoint the county or other municipal corporation whose geographic boundaries include, in whole or in part, the system of sewerage at issue. The municipal corporation may designate one of its agencies or divisions to operate the system, or it may contract with another entity to operate the system. The department of health or department of ecology, whichever has jurisdiction, must provide regulatory oversight for managing the system of sewerage.\n\n(2) In any petition for receivership under subsection (1) of this section, the commission must recommend that the court grant the receiver full authority to act in the best interests of the customers served by the system of sewerage.

The commission may, by order after an adjudicative proceeding as provided by chapter 34.05 RCW, approve, approve with conditions, or reject, a multiyear rate plan proposal made by a gas or electrical company or an alternative proposal made by one or more parties, or any combination thereof. The commission's consideration of a proposal for a multiyear rate plan is subject to the same standards applicable to other rate filings made under this title, including the public interest and fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates. In determining the public interest, the commission may consider such factors including, but not limited to, environmental health and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health and safety concerns, economic development, and equity, to the extent such factors affect the rates, services, and practices of a gas or electrical company regulated by the commission.(2) The commission may approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications any proposal to recover from ratepayers up to five percent of the total revenue requirement approved by the commission for each year of a multiyear rate plan for tariffs that reduce the energy burden of low-income residential customers including, but not limited to: (a) Bill assistance programs; or (b) one or more special rates. For any multiyear rate plan approved under this section resulting in a rate increase, the commission must approve an increase in the amount of low-income bill assistance to take effect in each year of the rate plan where there is a rate increase. At a minimum, the amount of such low-income assistance increase must be equal to double the percentage increase, if any, in the residential base rates approved for each year of the rate plan. The commission may approve a larger increase to low-income bill assistance based on an appropriate record.(3)(a) If it approves a multiyear rate plan, the commission shall separately approve rates for each of the initial rate year, the second rate year and, if applicable, the third rate year, and the fourth rate year.(b) The commission shall ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that is or will be used and useful under RCW  80.04.250 for service in this state by or during each rate year of the multiyear rate plan. For the initial rate year, the commission shall, at a minimum, ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that is used and useful for service in this state as of the rate effective date. The commission may order refunds to customers if property expected to be used and useful by the rate effective date when the commission approves a multiyear rate plan is in fact not used and useful by such a date.(c) The commission shall ascertain and determine the revenues and operating expenses for rate-making purposes of any gas or electrical company for each rate year of the multiyear rate plan.(d) In ascertaining and determining the fair value of property of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (b) of this subsection and projecting the revenues and operating expenses of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the commission may use any standard, formula, method, or theory of valuation reasonably calculated to arrive at fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates.(e) If the commission approves a multiyear rate plan with a duration of three or four years, then the electrical company must update its power costs as of the rate effective date of the third rate year. The proceeding to update the electrical company's power costs is subject to the same standards that apply to other rate filings made under this title.(4) Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the commission may by order establish terms, conditions, and procedures for a multiyear rate plan and ensure that rates remain fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient during the course of the plan.(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, a gas or electrical company is bound by the terms of the multiyear rate plan approved by the commission for each of the initial rate year and the second rate year. A gas or electrical company may file a new multiyear rate plan in accordance with this section for the third rate year and fourth rate year, if any, of a multiyear rate plan.(6) If the annual commission basis report for a gas or electrical company demonstrates that the reported rate of return on rate base of the company for the 12-month period ending as of the end of the period for which the annual commission basis report is filed is more than .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company, the company shall defer all revenues that are in excess of .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission for refunds to customers or another determination by the commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. If a multistate electrical company with fewer than 250,000 customers in Washington files a multiyear rate plan that provides for no increases in base rates in consecutive years beyond the initial rate year, the commission shall waive the requirements of this subsection provided that such a waiver results in just and reasonable rates.(7) The commission must, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of performance measures that will be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be based on proposals made by the gas or electrical company in its initial application, by any other party to the proceeding in its response to the company's filing, or in the testimony and evidence admitted in the proceeding. In developing performance measures, incentives, and penalty mechanisms, the commission may consider factors including, but not limited to, lowest reasonable cost planning, affordability, increases in energy burden, cost of service, customer satisfaction and engagement, service reliability, clean energy or renewable procurement, conservation acquisition, demand side management expansion, rate stability, timely execution of competitive procurement practices, attainment of state energy and emissions reduction policies, rapid integration of renewable energy resources, and fair compensation of utility employees.(8) Nothing in this section precludes any gas or electrical company from making filings required or permitted by the commission.(9) The commission shall align, to the extent practical, the timing of approval of a multiyear rate plan of an electrical company submitted pursuant to this section with the clean energy implementation plan of the electrical company filed pursuant to RCW  19.405.060.(10) The provisions of this section may not be construed to limit the existing rate-making authority of the commission.(11) The commission may require a large combination utility as defined in RCW 80.86.010 to incorporate the requirements of this section into an integrated system plan established under RCW 80.86.020.(12) The commission shall not approve, or approve with conditions, a multiyear rate plan that requires or incentivizes a gas company or large combination utility to terminate natural gas service to customers.(13) The commission shall not approve, or approve with conditions, a multiyear rate plan that authorizes a gas company or large combination utility to require a customer to involuntarily switch fuel use either by restricting access to natural gas service or by implementing planning requirements that would make access to natural gas service cost-prohibitive.\n\n(1) Beginning January 1, 2022, every general rate case filing of a gas or electrical company must include a proposal for a multiyear rate plan as provided in this chapter.

A gas or electrical company may file a new multiyear rate plan in accordance with this section for the third rate year and fourth rate year, if any, of a multiyear rate plan.\n\n(6) If the annual commission basis report for a gas or electrical company demonstrates that the reported rate of return on rate base of the company for the 12-month period ending as of the end of the period for which the annual commission basis report is filed is more than .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company, the company shall defer all revenues that are in excess of .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission for refunds to customers or another determination by the commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. If a multistate electrical company with fewer than 250,000 customers in Washington files a multiyear rate plan that provides for no increases in base rates in consecutive years beyond the initial rate year, the commission shall waive the requirements of this subsection provided that such a waiver results in just and reasonable rates.\n\n(7) The commission must, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of performance measures that will be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be based on proposals made by the gas or electrical company in its initial application, by any other party to the proceeding in its response to the company's filing, or in the testimony and evidence admitted in the proceeding. In developing performance measures, incentives, and penalty mechanisms, the commission may consider factors including, but not limited to, lowest reasonable cost planning, affordability, increases in energy burden, cost of service, customer satisfaction and engagement, service reliability, clean energy or renewable procurement, conservation acquisition, demand side management expansion, rate stability, timely execution of competitive procurement practices, attainment of state energy and emissions reduction policies, rapid integration of renewable energy resources, and fair compensation of utility employees.\n\n(8) Nothing in this section precludes any gas or electrical company from making filings required or permitted by the commission.\n\n(9) The commission shall align, to the extent practical, the timing of approval of a multiyear rate plan of an electrical company submitted pursuant to this section with the clean energy implementation plan of the electrical company filed pursuant to RCW  19.405.060.\n\n(10) The provisions of this section may not be construed to limit the existing rate-making authority of the commission.\n\n(11) The commission may require a large combination utility as defined in RCW 80.86.010 to incorporate the requirements of this section into an integrated system plan established under RCW 80.86.020.\n\n(12) The commission shall not approve, or approve with conditions, a multiyear rate plan that requires or incentivizes a gas company or large combination utility to terminate natural gas service to customers.\n\n(13) The commission shall not approve, or approve with conditions, a multiyear rate plan that authorizes a gas company or large combination utility to require a customer to involuntarily switch fuel use either by restricting access to natural gas service or by implementing planning requirements that would make access to natural gas service cost-prohibitive.\n\n[ 2025 c 1 s 4 (Initiative Measure No. 2066, approved November 5, 2024); 2024 c 351 s 18; 2021 c 188 s 2.]\n\nFindings—2025 c 1 (Initiative Measure No. 2066): See note following RCW 80.28.110.\n\nFindings—2025 c 1 (Initiative Measure No. 2066): See note following RCW 80.28.110.\n\nEffective date—2024 c 351: See note following RCW 80.86.010.\n\nEffective date—2024 c 351: See note following RCW 80.86.010.\n\nLegislative directive—2021 c 188: \"(1) To provide clarity and certainty to stakeholders on the details of performance-based regulation, the utilities and transportation commission is directed to conduct a proceeding to develop a policy statement addressing alternatives to traditional cost of service rate making, including performance measures or goals, targets, performance incentives, and penalty mechanisms.
