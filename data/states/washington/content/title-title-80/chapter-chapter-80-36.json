For the purposes of this section, \"promotional offering\" means a tariff that, for a period of up to ninety days, waives or reduces charges or conditions of service for existing or new subscribers for the purpose of retaining or increasing the number of customers who subscribe to or use a service.\n\n[(3)] During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.\n\n[ 2008 c 181 s 403; 2006 c 347 s 2; 2003 c 189 s 2; 1997 c 166 s 1.

Significant changes are occurring in the communications marketplace, including: (a) The migration from customer reliance on access lines for voice service to the use of broadband for a number of communications applications; and (b) changes in federal regulations governing: How communications providers compensate other providers for the use of the network; and eligibility for federal universal service funds. These changes are adversely affecting the ability of some communications providers to continue to offer communications services in rural areas of the state of Washington at rates that are comparable to those prevailing in urban areas. These changes, absent explicit federal and state universal service support for such communications providers, may lead, in the short term, to unreasonable telephone service rate increases or cessation of service for some Washington consumers.
