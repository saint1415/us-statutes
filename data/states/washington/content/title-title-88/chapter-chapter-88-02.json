Many highly destructive species, such as the zebra mussel, are currently not found in Washington's waters and efforts should be made to prevent the introduction or spread of these aquatic invasive species into our state waters. Preventing new introductions is significantly less expensive and causes far less ecological damage than trying to control new infestations.\n\nThe legislature also finds that freshwater algae, particularly blue-green algae, are also seriously degrading the water quality and recreational value of a number of our lakes. Blue-green algae can produce toxins that inhibit recreational uses and pose a threat to humans and pets.\n\nIt is therefore the intent of the legislature to clarify the roles of the different state agencies involved in these issues in order to address the threat of aquatic invasive species and the problem caused by aquatic freshwater algae, and to provide a dedicated fund source to prevent and control further impacts.\" [ 2005 c 464 s 1.]\n\nApplication—2005 c 464 s 2: \"Section 2 of this act applies to vessel registration fees that are due or become due on or after August 1, 2005.\" [ 2005 c 464 s 6.]\n\nApplication—2005 c 464 s 2: \"Section 2 of this act applies to vessel registration fees that are due or become due on or after August 1, 2005.\" [ 2005 c 464 s 6.]\n\nExpiration date—2005 c 464 s 2: \"Section 2 of this act expires June 30, 2012.\" [ 2005 c 464 s 7.]\n\nExpiration date—2005 c 464 s 2: \"Section 2 of this act expires June 30, 2012.\" [ 2005 c 464 s 7.]\n\nEffective date—2002 c 286: See RCW 79.100.901.\n\nEffective date—2002 c 286: See RCW 79.100.901.\n\nApplication—1993 c 244 s 38: \"Section 38 of this act applies to registrations expiring June 30, 1995, and thereafter.\" [ 1993 c 244 s 43.]\n\nApplication—1993 c 244 s 38: \"Section 38 of this act applies to registrations expiring June 30, 1995, and thereafter.\" [ 1993 c 244 s 43.]\n\nIntent—1993 c 244: See note following RCW 79A.60.010.\n\nIntent—1993 c 244: See note following RCW 79A.60.010.\n\nConstruction—Severability—Effective dates—1983 2nd ex.s. c 3: See notes following RCW 82.04.255.\n\nConstruction—Severability—Effective dates—1983 2nd ex.s. c 3: See notes following RCW 82.04.255.",
