After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.(2) If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.(3) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.(4) Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the named person and delivery.(5) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.(b) The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:(1) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person.
