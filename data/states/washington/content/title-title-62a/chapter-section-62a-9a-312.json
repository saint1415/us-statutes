If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a secured party, perfection occurs not earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and continues only while the secured party retains possession.(e) Time of perfection by delivery; continuation of perfection. A security interest in a certificated security in registered form is perfected by delivery when delivery of the certificated security occurs under RCW 62A.8-301 and remains perfected by delivery until the debtor obtains possession of the security certificate.(f) Acknowledgment not required. A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds possession for a secured party's benefit.(g) Effectiveness of acknowledgment; no duties or confirmation.

If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a secured party, perfection occurs not earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and continues only while the secured party retains possession.\n\n(e) Time of perfection by delivery; continuation of perfection. A security interest in a certificated security in registered form is perfected by delivery when delivery of the certificated security occurs under RCW 62A.8-301 and remains perfected by delivery until the debtor obtains possession of the security certificate.\n\n(f) Acknowledgment not required. A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds possession for a secured party's benefit.\n\n(g) Effectiveness of acknowledgment; no duties or confirmation.
