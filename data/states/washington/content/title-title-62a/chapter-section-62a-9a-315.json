If a security interest described in subsection (a) of this section becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in subsection (a) of this section, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.(c) Possessory security interest in collateral moved to new jurisdiction. A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if:(1) The collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;(2) Thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and(3) Upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.(d) Goods covered by certificate of title from this state. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered.(e) When subsection (d) security interest becomes unperfected against purchasers. A security interest described in subsection (d) of this section becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under RCW 62A.9A-311(b) or 62A.9A-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:(1) The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this state; or(2) The expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered.(f) Change in jurisdiction of chattel paper, controllable electronic record, bank, issuer, nominated person, securities intermediary, or commodity intermediary.
