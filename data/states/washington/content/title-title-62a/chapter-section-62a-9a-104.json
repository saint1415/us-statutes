A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the assignment of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the purchaser as the person to which the authoritative electronic copy was assigned.(b) Single authoritative copy. A system satisfies subsection (a) of this section if the record or records evidencing the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in a manner that:(1) A single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection, unalterable;(2) The authoritative copy identifies the purchaser as the assignee of the record or records;(3) The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the purchaser or its designated custodian;(4) Copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the purchaser;(5) Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and(6) Any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.(c) One or more authoritative copies. A system satisfies subsection (a) of this section, and a purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper, if the electronic copy, a record attached to or logically associated with the electronic copy, or a system in which the electronic copy is recorded:(1) Enables the purchaser readily to identify each electronic copy as either an authoritative copy or a nonauthoritative copy;(2) Enables the purchaser readily to identify itself in any way, including by name, identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number, as the assignee of the authoritative electronic copy; and(3) Gives the purchaser exclusive power, subject to subsection (d) of this section, to:(A) Prevent others from adding or changing an identified assignee of the authoritative electronic copy; and(B) Transfer control of the authoritative electronic copy.(d) Meaning of exclusive. Subject to subsection (e) of this section, a power is exclusive under subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B) of this section even if:(1) The authoritative electronic copy, a record attached to or logically associated with the authoritative electronic copy, or a system in which the authoritative electronic copy is recorded limits the use of the authoritative electronic copy or has a protocol programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control; or(2) The power is shared with another person.(e) When power not shared with another person. A power of a purchaser is not shared with another person under subsection (d)(2) of this section and the purchaser's power is not exclusive if:(1) The purchaser can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised by the other person; and(2) The other person:(A) Can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the purchaser; or(B) Is the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper.(f) Presumption of exclusivity of certain powers. If a purchaser has the powers specified in subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B) of this section, the powers are presumed to be exclusive.(g) Obtaining control through another person. A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if another person, other than the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper:(1) Has control of the authoritative electronic copy and acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser; or(2) Obtains control of the authoritative electronic copy after having acknowledged that it will obtain control of the electronic copy on behalf of the purchaser.\n\n(a) General rule: Control of electronic copy of record evidencing chattel paper.
