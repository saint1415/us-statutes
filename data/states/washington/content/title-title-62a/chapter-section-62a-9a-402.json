Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment:(1) For value;(2) In good faith;(3) Without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and(4) Without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under RCW 62A.3-305(a).(c) When subsection (b) of this section not applicable.

This section is subject to law other than this Article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.(f) Other law not displaced.
