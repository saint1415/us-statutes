If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to RCW 62A.4A-211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day.
