      "text": "RCW 62A.9A-705\n\nEffectiveness of action taken before effective date.\n\n(a) Preeffective-date action; one-year perfection period unless reperfected. If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before July 1, 2001, and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before July 1, 2001, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under Article 62A.9A RCW within one year after July 1, 2001. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after July 1, 2001, unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under Article 62A.9A RCW before the expiration of that period.(b) Preeffective-date filing. The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001, is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW.(c) Preeffective-date filing in jurisdiction formerly governing perfection. Article 62A.9A RCW does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and RCW 62A.9A-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:(1) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or(2) June 30, 2006.(d) Continuation statement. The filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2001. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2001, continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.(e) Application of subsection (c)(2) of this section to transmitting utility financing statement. Subsection (c)(2) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.(f) Application of Part 5. A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001, and a continuation statement filed after July 1, 2001, is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement.\n\n(a) Preeffective-date action; one-year perfection period unless reperfected. If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before July 1, 2001, and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before July 1, 2001, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under Article 62A.9A RCW within one year after July 1, 2001. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after July 1, 2001, unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under Article 62A.9A RCW before the expiration of that period.\n\n(b) Preeffective-date filing. The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001, is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under Article 62A.9A RCW.\n\n(c) Preeffective-date filing in jurisdiction formerly governing perfection. Article 62A.9A RCW does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and RCW 62A.9A-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:\n\n(1) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or\n\n(2) June 30, 2006.\n\n(d) Continuation statement. The filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2001. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001, and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2001, continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.\n\n(e) Application of subsection (c)(2) of this section to transmitting utility financing statement. Subsection (c)(2) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2001, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former *RCW 62A.9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.\n\n(f) Application of Part 5. A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001, and a continuation statement filed after July 1, 2001, is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement.\n\n[ 2001 c 32 s 49; 2000 c 250 s 9A-705.]\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 62A.9-103 was repealed by 2000 c 250 s 9A-901, effective July 1, 2001.\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 62A.9-103 was repealed by 2000 c 250 s 9A-901, effective July 1, 2001.\n\nEffective date—2001 c 32: See note following RCW 62A.9A-102.\n\nEffective date—2001 c 32: See note following RCW 62A.9A-102.",
