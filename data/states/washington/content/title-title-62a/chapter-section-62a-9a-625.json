Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (f) of this section, a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this Article or by filing a false statement under RCW 62A.9A-607(b) or 62A.9A-619. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.(c) Persons entitled to recover damages; statutory damages in consumer-goods transaction.
