The instruction may be addressed to any person, including the person giving the instruction, or to one or more persons jointly or in the alternative but not in succession. An authorization to pay is not an order unless the person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay.(7) \"Ordinary care\" in the case of a person engaged in business means observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the person is engaged. In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank's prescribed procedures and the bank's procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this Article or Article 4.(8) \"Party\" means a party to an instrument.(9) \"Promise\" means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation.(10) \"Prove\" with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing the fact (RCW 62A.1-201(b)(8)).(11) \"Remitter\" means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.(b) Other definitions applying to this Article and the sections in which they appear are:\"Acceptance\"RCW 62A.3-409\"Accommodated party\"RCW 62A.3-419\"Accommodation party\"RCW 62A.3-419\"Alteration\"RCW 62A.3-407\"Anomalous indorsement\"RCW 62A.3-205\"Blank indorsement\"RCW 62A.3-205\"Cashier's check\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Certificate of deposit\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Certified check\"RCW 62A.3-409\"Check\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Consideration\"RCW 62A.3-303\"Draft\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Holder in due course\"RCW 62A.3-302\"Incomplete instrument\"RCW 62A.3-115\"Indorsement\"RCW 62A.3-204\"Indorser\"RCW 62A.3-204\"Instrument\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Issue\"RCW 62A.3-105\"Issuer\"RCW 62A.3-105\"Negotiable instrument\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Negotiation\"RCW 62A.3-201\"Note\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Payable at a definite time\"RCW 62A.3-108\"Payable on demand\"RCW 62A.3-108\"Payable to bearer\"RCW 62A.3-109\"Payable to order\"RCW 62A.3-109\"Payment\"RCW 62A.3-602\"Person entitled to enforce\"RCW 62A.3-301\"Presentment\"RCW 62A.3-501\"Reacquisition\"RCW 62A.3-207\"Special indorsement\"RCW 62A.3-205\"Teller's check\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Transfer of instrument\"RCW 62A.3-203\"Traveler's check\"RCW 62A.3-104\"Value\"RCW 62A.3-303(c) The following definitions in other articles apply to this Article:\"Banking day\"RCW 62A.4-104\"Clearinghouse\"RCW 62A.4-104\"Collecting bank\"RCW 62A.4-105\"Depositary bank\"RCW 62A.4-105\"Documentary draft\"RCW 62A.4-104\"Intermediary bank\"RCW 62A.4-105\"Item\"RCW 62A.4-104\"Payor bank\"RCW 62A.4-105\"Suspends payments\"RCW 62A.4-104(d) In addition, Article 1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this Article.\n\n(a) In this Article:\n\n(1) \"Acceptor\" means a drawee who has accepted a draft.\n\n(2) \"Drawee\" means a person ordered in a draft to make payment.\n\n(3) \"Drawer\" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment.\n\n(4) [Reserved.]\n\n(5) \"Maker\" means a person who signs or is identified in a note as a person undertaking to pay.\n\n(6) \"Order\" means a written instruction to pay money signed by the person giving the instruction.
