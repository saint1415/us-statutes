The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith.

Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.(e) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.\n\n(a) A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that:\n\n(1) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item;\n\n(2) All signatures on the item are authentic and authorized;\n\n(3) The item has not been altered;\n\n(4) The item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (RCW 62A.3-305(a)) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor; and\n\n(5) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.\n\n(b) If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item (i) according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred, or (ii) if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in RCW 62A.3-115 and 62A.3-407.
