      "text": "RCW 62A.9A-525\n\n(a) Filing with department of licensing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or (e) of this section, the fee for filing and indexing a record under this part is the fee set by department of licensing rule pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Without limitation, different fees may be charged for:(1) A record that is communicated in writing and consists of one or two pages;(2) A record that is communicated in writing and consists of more than two pages, which fee may be a multiple of the fee described in (1) of this subsection; and(3) A record that is communicated by another medium authorized by department of licensing rule, which fee may be a fraction of the fee described in (1) of this subsection.(b) Filing with other filing offices. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, the fee for filing and indexing a record under this part that is filed in a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) is the fee that would otherwise be applicable to the recording of a mortgage in that filing office, as set forth in RCW 36.18.010.(c) Number of names. The number of names required to be indexed does not affect the amount of the fee in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.(d) Response to information request. The fee for responding to a request for information from a filing office, including for issuing a certificate showing, or otherwise communicating, whether there is on file any financing statement naming a particular debtor, is the fee set by department of licensing rule pursuant to subsection (f) of this section; provided however, if the request is to a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) and that office charges a different fee, then that different fee shall apply instead. Without limitation, different fees may be charged:(1) If the request is communicated in writing;(2) If the request is communicated by another medium authorized by filing-office rule; and(3) If the request is for expedited service.(e) Record of mortgage. This section does not require a fee with respect to a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut under RCW 62A.9A-502(c). However, the recording and satisfaction fees that otherwise would be applicable to the record of the mortgage apply.(f) Filing office rules. (1) The department of licensing shall by rule set the fees called for in this section for filing with, and obtaining information from, the department of licensing. The director shall set fees at a sufficient level to defray the costs of administering the program. All receipts from fees collected under this title, except fees for services covered under RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1), shall be deposited to the uniform commercial code fund in the state treasury. Moneys in the fund may be spent only after appropriation and may be used only to administer the uniform commercial code program.(2) Until July 1, 2030, in addition to fees on filings authorized under this section, the department of licensing shall impose a surcharge of fifteen dollars per filing for paper filings and a surcharge of fifteen dollars per filing for electronic filings. The department shall deposit the proceeds from these surcharges in the financial fraud and identity theft crimes investigation and prosecution account created in RCW 43.330.300.(g) Transition. This section continues the fee-setting authority conferred on the department of licensing by former *RCW 62A.9-409 and nothing herein shall invalidate fees set by the department of licensing under the authority of former *RCW 62A.9-409.\n\n(a) Filing with department of licensing.
