A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the assignment of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the purchaser as the person to which the authoritative electronic copy was assigned.(b) Single authoritative copy.

A power of a purchaser is not shared with another person under subsection (d)(2) of this section and the purchaser's power is not exclusive if:(1) The purchaser can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised by the other person; and(2) The other person:(A) Can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the purchaser; or(B) Is the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper.(f) Presumption of exclusivity of certain powers. If a purchaser has the powers specified in subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B) of this section, the powers are presumed to be exclusive.(g) Obtaining control through another person. A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if another person, other than the transferor to the purchaser of an interest in the chattel paper:(1) Has control of the authoritative electronic copy and acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser; or(2) Obtains control of the authoritative electronic copy after having acknowledged that it will obtain control of the electronic copy on behalf of the purchaser.\n\n(a) General rule: Control of electronic copy of record evidencing chattel paper.
