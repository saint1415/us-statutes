If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this Article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.(b) Damages for noncompliance. Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (f) of this section, a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this Article or by filing a false statement under RCW 62A.9A-607(b) or 62A.9A-619. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.(c) Persons entitled to recover damages; statutory damages in consumer-goods transaction. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-628:(1) A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) of this section for its loss; and(2) If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten percent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus ten percent of the cash price.(d) Recovery when deficiency eliminated or reduced. A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under RCW 62A.9A-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor may not recover under subsection (b) or (c)(2) of this section for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance to the extent that its deficiency is eliminated or reduced under RCW 62A.9A-626.(e) Statutory damages: Noncompliance with specified provisions. In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (b) of this section, the debtor, consumer obligor, or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover five hundred dollars in each case from a person that:(1) Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-208;(2) Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-209;(3) Files a record that the person is not entitled to file under RCW 62A.9A-509(a);(4) Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by RCW 62A.9A-513 (a) or (c) within twenty days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor;(5) Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-616(b)(1) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance; or(6) Fails to comply with RCW 62A.9A-616(b)(2).(f) Statutory damages: Noncompliance with RCW 62A.9A-210.

If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under RCW 62A.9A-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.\n\n(a) Judicial orders concerning noncompliance.
