However, the delivery of these services bring risks because the in-home location of services makes their actual delivery virtually invisible. Also, the complexity of products, services, and delivery systems in today's health care delivery system challenges even informed and healthy individuals. The fact that these services are delivered to the state's most vulnerable population, the ill or disabled who are frequently also elderly, adds to these risks.It is the intent of the legislature to protect the citizens of Washington state by licensing home health, hospice, and home care agencies. This legislation [act] is not intended to unreasonably restrict entry into the in-home service marketplace. Standards established are intended to be the minimum necessary to ensure safe and competent care, and should be demonstrably related to patient safety and welfare.\n\nThe legislature finds that the availability of home health, hospice, and home care services has improved the quality of life for Washington's citizens.
