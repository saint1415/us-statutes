The committee may also evaluate and recommend policy options that would take action to:\n\n(a) Improve pesticide application safety with agricultural applications;\n\n(b) Lead an effort to establish baseline data for the type and quantity of pesticide applications used in Washington to be able to compare the number of exposures with overall number of applications;\n\n(c) Research ways to improve pesticide application communication among different members of the agricultural community, including educating the public in English and Spanish about acute and chronic health information about pesticides;\n\n(d) Compile industry's best practices for use to improve pesticide application safety to limit pesticide exposure;\n\n(e) Continue to investigate reasons why members of the agricultural workforce do not or may not report pesticide exposure;\n\n(f) Explore new avenues for reporting with investigation without fear of retaliation;\n\n(g) Work with stakeholders to consider trainings for how and when to report;\n\n(h) Explore incentives for using new technology by funding a partial buy-out program for old spray technology;\n\n(i) Consider developing an effective community health education plan;\n\n(j) Consult with community partners to enhance educational initiatives that work with the agricultural workforce, their families, and surrounding communities to reduce the risk of pesticide exposure;\n\n(k) Enhance efforts to work with pesticide manufacturers and the environmental protection agency to improve access to non-English pesticide labeling in the United States;\n\n(l) Work with research partners to develop, or promote the use of translation apps for pesticide label safety information, or both;\n\n(m) Evaluate prevention techniques to minimize exposure events;\n\n(n) Develop more Spanish language and other language educational materials for distribution, including through social media and app-based learning for agricultural workforce communities;\n\n(o) Explore development of an agricultural workforce education safety program to improve the understanding about leaving an area being sprayed; and\n\n(p) Work with the industry and the agricultural workforce to improve protocols and best practices for use of personal safety equipment for applicators and reflective gear for the general workforce.\n\n(6) The committee must provide a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by May 1, 2020, and each year thereafter. An initial report on the progress of the committee must be provided in January 2020. The report may include recommendations the committee determines necessary, and must document the activities of the committee and report on the subjects listed in subsection (5) of this section. The department of health and the department of agriculture must provide staff support to the committee for the purpose of authoring the report and transmitting it to the legislature. Any member of the committee may provide a minority report as an appendix to the report submitted to the legislature under this section.\n\n(7) This section expires July 1, 2035.\n\n[ 2025 c 84 s 1; 2019 c 327 s 2.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 84: \"This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect July 1, 2025.\" [ 2025 c 84 s 4.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 84: \"This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect July 1, 2025.\" [ 2025 c 84 s 4.]\n\nFindings—2025 c 84; 2019 c 327: \"(1) In 2018, the legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6529. The bill recognized that farmers, farmworkers, and the broader community share an interest in minimizing human exposure to pesticides. It also recognized that gains have been made in reducing human exposure to pesticides and that collaboration between state agencies and the farming community could further reduce agricultural workers exposure to pesticide drift.(2) The legislation established a pesticide application safety work group that would make recommendations for improving pesticide application safety. Work group members included legislators from both chambers and caucuses, as well as representation from state agencies and the commission on Hispanic affairs. The work group sought public participation to learn more about pesticide application safety. Many stakeholders including but not limited to local farm hosts, the agricultural industry, and members of the agricultural workforce contributed valuable assistance and input.(3) The work group reached two noteworthy recommendations regarding what can be done now to improve pesticide application safety. The recommendations are to:(a) Expand training because the department of agriculture lacks sufficient resources to meet the training demand from pesticide applicators and handlers; and(b) Establish a new pesticide application safety panel to provide an opportunity to evaluate and recommend policy options, and investigate exposure cases.(4) The work group concluded that legislation is warranted to expand funding for a training program and set up a new pesticide application safety panel with clear objectives.(5) This section expires July 1, 2035.\" [ 2025 c 84 s 2; 2019 c 327 s 1.]\n\nFindings—2025 c 84; 2019 c 327: \"(1) In 2018, the legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6529.
