Sec. 12101 et seq. and other applicable federal or state antidiscrimination laws and regulations.\n\n(4) This section does not prohibit a state hospital from exercising its authority to terminate, suspend, or discipline an employee who engages in workplace reprisal or retaliatory action against a whistleblower. The protections provided to whistleblowers under this chapter shall not prevent a state hospital from: (a) Terminating, suspending, or disciplining a whistleblower for other lawful purposes; or (b) for facilities with six or fewer residents, reducing the hours of employment or terminating employment as a result of the demonstrated inability to meet payroll requirements. The department shall determine if the facility cannot meet payroll in cases where a whistleblower has been terminated or had hours of employment reduced due to the inability of a facility to meet payroll.\n\n(5) The department shall adopt rules to implement procedures for filing, investigation, and resolution of whistleblower complaints that are integrated with complaint procedures under this chapter.\n\n(6) No resident who relies upon and is being provided spiritual treatment in lieu of medical treatment in accordance with the tenets and practices of a well-recognized religious denomination shall for that reason alone be considered abandoned, abused, or neglected, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to authorize, permit, or require medical treatment contrary to the stated or clearly implied objection of such a person.\n\n(7) The department shall adopt rules designed to discourage whistleblower complaints made in bad faith or for retaliatory purposes.\n\n[ 1999 c 176 s 26; 1997 c 392 s 201.]\n\nFindings—Purpose—Severability—Conflict with federal requirements—1999 c 176: See notes following RCW 74.34.005.\n\nFindings—Purpose—Severability—Conflict with federal requirements—1999 c 176: See notes following RCW 74.34.005.\n\nShort title—Findings—Construction—Conflict with federal requirements—Part headings and captions not law—1997 c 392: See notes following RCW 74.39A.009.\n\nShort title—Findings—Construction—Conflict with federal requirements—Part headings and captions not law—1997 c 392: See notes following RCW 74.39A.009.",
