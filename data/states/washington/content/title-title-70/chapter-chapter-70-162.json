Scientific studies indicate that pollutants common in the indoor air may include radon, asbestos, volatile organic chemicals including formaldehyde and benzene, combustion by-products including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide, metals and gases including lead, chlorine, and ozone, respirable particles, tobacco smoke, biological contaminants, microorganisms, and other contaminants. In some circumstances, exposure to these substances may cause adverse health effects, including respiratory illnesses, multiple chemical sensitivities, skin and eye irritations, headaches, and other related symptoms. There is inadequate information about indoor air quality within the state of Washington, including the sources and nature of indoor air pollution.The intent of the legislature is to develop a control strategy that will improve indoor air quality, provide for the evaluation of indoor air quality in public buildings, and encourage voluntary measures to improve indoor air quality.\n\nThe legislature finds that many Washington residents spend a significant amount of their time working indoors and that exposure to indoor air pollutants may occur in public buildings, schools, workplaces, and other indoor environments.
