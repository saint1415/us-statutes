Prenatal drug exposure frequently results in infants suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome and its accompanying withdrawal symptoms after birth. Withdrawal symptoms may include sleep problems, excessive crying, tremors, seizures, poor feeding, fever, generalized convulsions, vomiting, diarrhea, and hyperactive reflexes. Consequently, the legislature finds that drug exposed infants have unique medical needs and benefit from specialized health care that addresses their withdrawal symptoms. Specialized care for infants experiencing neonatal abstinence syndrome is based on the individual needs of the infant and includes: Administration of intravenous fluids and drugs such as morphine; personalized, hands-on therapeutic care such as gentle rocking, reduction in noise and lights, and swaddling; and frequent high-calorie feedings.The legislature further finds that drug exposed infants often require hospitalization which burdens hospitals and hospital staff who either have to increase staffing levels or require current staff to take on additional duties to administer the specialized care needed by drug exposed infants.The legislature further finds that drug exposed infants benefit from early and consistent family involvement in their care, and families thrive when they are provided the opportunity, skills, and training to help them participate in their child's care.The legislature further finds that infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome often can be treated in a nonhospital clinic setting where they receive appropriate medical and nonmedical care for their symptoms. The legislature, therefore, intends to encourage alternatives to continued hospitalization for drug exposed infants, including the continuation and development of pediatric transitional care services that provide short-term medical care as well as training and assistance to caregivers in order to support the transition from hospital to home for drug exposed infants.\" [ 2017 c 263 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2017 c 263: \"The legislature finds that more than twelve thousand infants born in Washington each year have been prenatally exposed to opiates, methamphetamines, and other drugs.

If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the limited stop placement.\n\n(ii) When the department imposes a limited stop placement, the private establishment may not accept any new admissions in the category or categories subject to the limited stop placement until the limited stop placement order is terminated.\n\n(iii) The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the private establishment if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the limited stop placement has been corrected.\n\n(iv) The limited stop placement shall be terminated when:\n\n(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the limited stop placement has been corrected or the department determines that the private establishment has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and\n\n(B) The private establishment establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.\n\n(d) The department may suspend all new admissions to the private establishment by imposing a stop placement. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy and is not confined to a specific category or categories of patients or a specific area of the private establishment.\n\n(i) Prior to imposing a stop placement, the department shall provide a private establishment written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy, and the private establishment shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the stop placement.\n\n(ii) When the department imposes a stop placement, the private establishment may not accept any new admissions until the stop placement order is terminated.\n\n(iii) The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the private establishment if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected.\n\n(iv) The stop placement order shall be terminated when:\n\n(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected or the department determines that the private establishment has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and\n\n(B) The private establishment establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.\n\n(e) The department may suspend a specific category or categories of services within the private establishment as related to the violation by imposing a limited stop service. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy.\n\n(i) Prior to imposing a limited stop service, the department shall provide a private establishment written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. The private establishment shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the limited stop service.\n\n(ii) When the department imposes a limited stop service, the private establishment may not provide the services in the category or categories subject to the limited stop service to any new or existing individuals, unless otherwise allowed by the department, until the limited stop service is terminated.\n\n(iii) The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the private establishment if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected.\n\n(iv) The limited stop service shall be terminated when:\n\n(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected or the department determines that the private establishment has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and\n\n(B) The private establishment establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.\n\n(f) The department may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license.\n\n(2)(a) Except as otherwise provided, RCW 43.70.115 governs notice of the imposition of conditions on a license, a limited stop placement, stop placement, limited stop service, or the suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew a license and provides the right to an adjudicative proceeding. Adjudicative proceedings and hearings under this section are governed by the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW. The application for an adjudicative proceeding must be in writing, state the basis for contesting the adverse action, including a copy of the department's notice, be served on and received by the department within 28 days of the licensee's receipt of the adverse notice, and be served in a manner that shows proof of receipt.\n\n(b) When the department determines a licensee's noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy, the department may make the imposition of conditions on a licensee, a limited stop placement, stop placement, limited stop service, or the suspension of a license effective immediately upon receipt of the notice by the licensee, pending any adjudicative proceeding.\n\n(i) When the department makes the suspension of a license or imposition of conditions on a license effective immediately, a licensee is entitled to a show cause hearing before a presiding officer within 14 days of making the request. The licensee must request the show cause hearing within 28 days of receipt of the notice of immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions. At the show cause hearing the department has the burden of demonstrating that more probably than not there is an immediate jeopardy.\n\n(ii) At the show cause hearing, the presiding officer may consider the notice and documents supporting the immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions and the licensee's response and must provide the parties with an opportunity to provide documentary evidence and written testimony, and to be represented by counsel. Prior to the show cause hearing, the department must provide the licensee with all documentation that supports the department's immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions.\n\n(iii) If the presiding officer determines there is no immediate jeopardy, the presiding officer may overturn the immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions.\n\n(iv) If the presiding officer determines there is immediate jeopardy, the immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions shall remain in effect pending a full hearing.\n\n(v) If the secretary sustains the immediate suspension or immediate imposition of conditions, the licensee may request an expedited full hearing on the merits of the department's action. A full hearing must be provided within 90 days of the licensee's request.\n\n(3) When the department determines an alleged violation, if true, would constitute an immediate jeopardy, and the licensee fails to cooperate with the department's investigation of such an alleged violation, the department may impose an immediate stop placement, immediate limited stop placement, immediate limited stop service, immediate imposition of conditions, or immediate suspension.\n\n(a) When the department imposes an immediate stop placement, immediate limited stop placement, immediate limited stop service, immediate imposition of conditions, or immediate suspension for failure to cooperate, a licensee is entitled to a show cause hearing before a presiding officer within 14 days of making the request. The licensee must request the show cause hearing within 28 days of receipt of the notice of an immediate stop placement, immediate limited stop placement, immediate limited stop service, immediate imposition of conditions, or immediate suspension for failure to cooperate. At the show cause hearing the department has the burden of demonstrating that more probably than not the alleged violation, if true, would constitute an immediate jeopardy and the licensee failed to cooperate with the department's investigation.\n\n(b) At the show cause hearing, the presiding officer may consider the notice and documents supporting the immediate stop placement, immediate limited stop placement, immediate limited stop service, immediate imposition of conditions, or immediate suspension for failure to cooperate, and the licensee's response and shall provide the parties with an opportunity to provide documentary evidence and written testimony, and to be represented by counsel. Prior to the show cause hearing, the department shall provide the licensee with all documentation that supports the department's immediate action for failure to cooperate.\n\n(c) If the presiding officer determines the alleged violation, if true, does not constitute an immediate jeopardy or determines that the licensee cooperated with the department's investigation, the presiding officer may overturn the immediate action for failure to cooperate.\n\n(d) If the presiding officer determines the allegation, if true, would constitute an immediate jeopardy and the licensee failed to cooperate with the department's investigation, the immediate action for failure to cooperate shall remain in effect pending a full hearing.\n\n(e) If the presiding officer sustains the immediate action for failure to cooperate, the licensee may request an expedited full hearing on the merits of the department's action. A full hearing must be provided within 90 days of the licensee's request.\n\n[ 2025 c 389 s 11; 2024 c 121 s 18; 2020 c 115 s 3.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2025 c 389: See note following RCW 48.43.732.\n\nFinding—Intent—2025 c 389: See note following RCW 48.43.732.\n\nFindings—Intent—Effective date—2020 c 115: See notes following RCW 71.12.700.\n\nFindings—Intent—Effective date—2020 c 115: See notes following RCW 71.12.700.",
