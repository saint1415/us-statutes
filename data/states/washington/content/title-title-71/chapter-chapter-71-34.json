      "text": "RCW 71.34.010\n\n(1) It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that minors in need of behavioral health care and treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and involuntary treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the authority and the department that provide behavioral health services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver those services.(2) It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the rights of adolescents to confidentiality and to independently seek services for behavioral health disorders. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall guard against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty, enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment, and encourage the use of voluntary services. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall, whenever clinically appropriate, offer less restrictive alternatives to inpatient treatment. Additionally, all behavioral health care and treatment providers shall assure that minors' parents are given an opportunity to participate in the treatment decisions for their minor children. The behavioral health care and treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents or family.(3)(a) It is the intent of the legislature to enhance continuity of care for minors with serious behavioral health disorders that can be controlled or stabilized in a less restrictive alternative commitment. Within the guidelines stated in In re LaBelle, 107 Wn.2d 196 (1986), the legislature intends to encourage appropriate interventions at a point when there is the best opportunity to restore the minor to or maintain satisfactory functioning.(b) For minors with a prior history or pattern of repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions due to decompensation, the consideration of prior behavioral health history is particularly relevant in determining whether the minor would receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.(c) Therefore, the legislature finds that for minors who are currently under a commitment order, a prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions should be given great weight in determining whether a new less restrictive alternative commitment should be ordered. The court must also consider any school behavioral issues, the impact on the family, the safety of other children in the household, and the developmental age of the minor.(4) It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the health and safety of minors suffering from behavioral health disorders and to protect public safety through use of the parens patriae and police powers of the state. Accordingly, when construing the requirements of this chapter the court must focus on the merits of the petition, except where requirements have been totally disregarded, as provided in In re C.W., 147 Wn.2d 259, 281 (2002). A presumption in favor of deciding petitions on their merits furthers both public and private interests because the mental and physical well-being of minors as well as public safety may be implicated by the decision to release a minor and discontinue his or her treatment.(5) It is also the purpose of this chapter to assure the ability of parents to exercise reasonable, compassionate care and control of their minor children when there is a medical necessity for treatment and without the requirement of filing a petition under this chapter, including the ability to request and receive medically necessary treatment for their adolescent children without the consent of the adolescent.\n\n(1) It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that minors in need of behavioral health care and treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and involuntary treatment.

(Effective until July 1, 2026.)\n\n(1) At any time during the minor's period of fourteen-day commitment, the professional person in charge may petition the court for an order requiring the minor to undergo an additional one hundred eighty-day period of treatment. The evidence in support of the petition shall be presented by the county prosecutor unless the petition is filed by the professional person in charge of a state-operated facility in which case the evidence shall be presented by the attorney general.(2) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall contain the following:(a) The name and address of the petitioner or petitioners;(b) The name of the minor alleged to meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment;(c) A statement that the petitioner is the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program responsible for the treatment of the minor;(d) The date of the fourteen-day commitment order; and(e) A summary of the facts supporting the petition.(3) The petition shall be supported by accompanying affidavits signed by: (a) Two examining physicians, one of whom shall be a child psychiatrist, or two psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioners, one of whom shall be a child and adolescent or family psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner. If the petition is for substance use disorder treatment, the petition may be signed by a substance use disorder professional instead of a mental health professional and by an advanced registered nurse practitioner instead of a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, or two physician assistants, one of whom must be supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist; (b) one children's mental health specialist and either an examining physician, physician assistant, or a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner; or (c) two among an examining physician, physician assistant, and a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, one of which needs to be a child psychiatrist, a physician assistant supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist, or a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner. The affidavits shall describe in detail the behavior of the detained minor which supports the petition and shall state whether a less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment is in the best interests of the minor.(4) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall be filed with the clerk of the court at least three days before the expiration of the fourteen-day commitment period. The petitioner or the petitioner's designee shall within twenty-four hours of filing serve a copy of the petition on the minor and notify the minor's attorney and the minor's parent. A copy of the petition shall be provided to such persons at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.(5) At the time of filing, the court shall set a date within seven days for the hearing on the petition. If the hearing is not commenced within thirty days after the filing of the petition, including extensions of time requested by the detained person or his or her attorney or the court in the administration of justice under RCW 71.34.735, the minor must be released. The minor or the parents shall be afforded the same rights as in a fourteen-day commitment hearing. Treatment of the minor shall continue pending the proceeding.(6) For one hundred eighty-day commitment:(a) The court must find by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the minor:(i) Is suffering from a mental disorder or substance use disorder;(ii) Presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled; and(iii) Is in need of further treatment that only can be provided in a one hundred eighty-day commitment.(b) If commitment is for a substance use disorder, the court must find that there is an available approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the minor.(7) In determining whether an inpatient or less restrictive alternative commitment is appropriate, great weight must be given to evidence of a prior history or pattern of decompensation and discontinuation of treatment resulting in: (a) Repeated hospitalizations; or (b) repeated peace officer interventions resulting in juvenile charges. Such evidence may be used to provide a factual basis for concluding that the minor would not receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.(8)(a) If the court finds that the criteria for commitment are met and that less restrictive treatment in a community setting is not appropriate or available, the court shall order the minor committed to the custody of the director for further inpatient mental health treatment, to an approved substance use disorder treatment program for further substance use disorder treatment, or to a private treatment and evaluation facility for inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment if the minor's parents have assumed responsibility for payment for the treatment. If the court finds that a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order less restrictive alternative treatment upon such conditions as necessary.(b) If the court determines that the minor does not meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment, the minor shall be released.(9) Successive one hundred eighty-day commitments are permissible on the same grounds and under the same procedures as the original one hundred eighty-day commitment. Such petitions shall be filed at least three days prior to the expiration of the previous one hundred eighty-day commitment order.\n\n(1) At any time during the minor's period of fourteen-day commitment, the professional person in charge may petition the court for an order requiring the minor to undergo an additional one hundred eighty-day period of treatment.

The evidence in support of the petition shall be presented by the county prosecutor unless the petition is filed by the professional person in charge of a state-operated facility in which case the evidence shall be presented by the attorney general.\n\n(2) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall contain the following:\n\n(a) The name and address of the petitioner or petitioners;\n\n(b) The name of the minor alleged to meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment;\n\n(c) A statement that the petitioner is the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program responsible for the treatment of the minor;\n\n(d) The date of the fourteen-day commitment order; and\n\n(e) A summary of the facts supporting the petition.\n\n(3) The petition shall be supported by accompanying affidavits signed by: (a) Two examining physicians, one of whom shall be a child psychiatrist, or two psychiatric advanced practice registered nurses, one of whom shall be a child and adolescent or family psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse. If the petition is for substance use disorder treatment, the petition may be signed by a substance use disorder professional instead of a mental health professional and by an advanced practice registered nurse instead of a psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse, or two physician assistants, one of whom must be supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist; (b) one children's mental health specialist and either an examining physician, physician assistant, or a psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse; or (c) two among an examining physician, physician assistant, and a psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse, one of which needs to be a child psychiatrist, a physician assistant supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist, or a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner. The affidavits shall describe in detail the behavior of the detained minor which supports the petition and shall state whether a less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment is in the best interests of the minor.\n\n(4) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall be filed with the clerk of the court at least three days before the expiration of the fourteen-day commitment period. The petitioner or the petitioner's designee shall within twenty-four hours of filing serve a copy of the petition on the minor and notify the minor's attorney and the minor's parent. A copy of the petition shall be provided to such persons at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.\n\n(5) At the time of filing, the court shall set a date within seven days for the hearing on the petition. If the hearing is not commenced within thirty days after the filing of the petition, including extensions of time requested by the detained person or his or her attorney or the court in the administration of justice under RCW 71.34.735, the minor must be released. The minor or the parents shall be afforded the same rights as in a fourteen-day commitment hearing. Treatment of the minor shall continue pending the proceeding.\n\n(6) For one hundred eighty-day commitment, the court must find by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the minor:\n\n(a) Is suffering from a mental disorder or substance use disorder;\n\n(b) Presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled; and\n\n(c) Is in need of further treatment that only can be provided in a one hundred eighty-day commitment.\n\n(7) In determining whether an inpatient or less restrictive alternative commitment is appropriate, great weight must be given to evidence of a prior history or pattern of decompensation and discontinuation of treatment resulting in: (a) Repeated hospitalizations; or (b) repeated peace officer interventions resulting in juvenile charges. Such evidence may be used to provide a factual basis for concluding that the minor would not receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.\n\n(8)(a) If the court finds that the criteria for commitment are met and that less restrictive treatment in a community setting is not appropriate or available, the court shall order the minor committed to the custody of the director for further inpatient mental health treatment, to an approved substance use disorder treatment program for further substance use disorder treatment, or to a private treatment and evaluation facility for inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment if the minor's parents have assumed responsibility for payment for the treatment. If the court finds that a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order less restrictive alternative treatment upon such conditions as necessary.\n\n(b) If the court determines that the minor does not meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment, the minor shall be released.\n\n(9) Successive one hundred eighty-day commitments are permissible on the same grounds and under the same procedures as the original one hundred eighty-day commitment. Such petitions shall be filed at least three days prior to the expiration of the previous one hundred eighty-day commitment order.\n\n[ 2025 c 58 s 5162; 2024 c 62 s 29.

(Effective until July 1, 2026.)\n\n(1) If the professional person in charge of an outpatient treatment program, a designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, determines that a minor is failing to adhere to the conditions of the court order for less restrictive alternative treatment or the conditions for the conditional release, or that substantial deterioration in the minor's functioning has occurred, the designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may order that the minor be taken into custody and transported to an inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program. A secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the minor must be available.(2)(a) The designated crisis responder, director, or secretary, as appropriate, shall file the order of apprehension and detention and serve it upon the minor and notify the minor's parent and the minor's attorney, if any, of the detention within two days of return. At the time of service the minor shall be informed of the right to a hearing and to representation by an attorney. The designated crisis responder or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may modify or rescind the order of apprehension and detention at any time prior to the hearing.(b) If the minor is involuntarily detained for revocation at an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program in a different county from where the minor was initially detained, the facility or program may file the order of apprehension, serve it on the minor and notify the minor's parents and the minor's attorney at the request of the designated crisis responder.(3) A petition for revocation of less restrictive alternative treatment shall be filed by the designated crisis responder or the director, secretary, or facility, as appropriate, with the court in the county where the minor is detained. The court shall conduct the hearing in that county. A petition for revocation of conditional release must be filed in the county where the minor is detained. A petition shall describe the behavior of the minor indicating violation of the conditions or deterioration of routine functioning and a dispositional recommendation. The hearing shall be held within seven days of the minor's return. The issues to be determined are whether the minor did or did not adhere to the conditions of the less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release, or whether the minor's routine functioning has substantially deteriorated, and, if so, whether the conditions of less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be modified or, subject to subsection (4) of this section, whether the minor should be returned to inpatient treatment. Pursuant to the determination of the court, the minor shall be returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions or shall be returned to inpatient treatment. If the minor is returned to inpatient treatment, RCW 71.34.760 regarding the director's placement responsibility shall apply. The hearing may be waived by the minor and the minor returned to inpatient treatment or to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions.(4) A court may not order the return of a minor to inpatient treatment in a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program unless there is a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program available with adequate space for the minor.(5) Prior to taking any action to enforce, modify, or revoke a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order in which the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the minor is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and Indian health care provider regarding any action that will be taken under this section as soon as possible, but no later than three hours from the time the decision to take action is made. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must provide the tribe and Indian health care provider with a copy of the petition, together with any orders issued by the court and a notice of the tribe's right to intervene as soon as possible, but before any hearing under this section, and no later than 24 hours from the time the petition is served upon the person and the person's guardian. The court clerk shall provide copies of any court orders necessary for the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to provide notice to the tribe or Indian health care provider under this section. Notification under this section is subject to any federal and state laws and regulations including the requirements in RCW 70.02.240 and shall be made in person or by telephonic or electronic communication to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan.\n\n(1) If the professional person in charge of an outpatient treatment program, a designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, determines that a minor is failing to adhere to the conditions of the court order for less restrictive alternative treatment or the conditions for the conditional release, or that substantial deterioration in the minor's functioning has occurred, the designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may order that the minor be taken into custody and transported to an inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program.
