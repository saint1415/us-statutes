The rebuild or refurbishment does not constitute repowering if it is part of routine major maintenance or the maintenance of or replacement of equipment that does not materially affect the expected physical or economical life of the turbine or facility.(6) \"Utility-scale wind energy facility\" means a facility used in the generation of electricity by means of turbines or other devices that capture and employ the kinetic energy of the wind and:(a) Is required under federal aviation administration regulations, guidelines, circulars, or standards, as they existed as of January 1, 2023, to have obstruction lights; or(b) Has at least one obstruction light and at least one wind turbine with a hub height of at least 75 feet above ground level.\n\nThe definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n\n(1) \"Aircraft detection lighting system\" means a sensor-based system that:\n\n(a) Is designed to detect approaching aircraft;\n\n(b) Automatically activates appropriate obstruction lights until the lights are no longer needed by the aircraft; and\n\n(c) The federal aviation administration has approved as meeting the requirements set forth in chapter 10 of the federal aviation administration's 2020 advisory circular AC 70/7460-1M, \"Obstruction marking and lighting.\"\n\n(2)\"Department\" means the department of ecology.\n\n(3) \"Hub height\" means the distance from the ground to the middle of a wind turbine's rotor.\n\n(4) \"Light-mitigating technology system\" means aircraft detection lighting or another federal aviation administration-approved system capable of reducing the impact of aviation obstruction lighting while maintaining conspicuity sufficient to assist aircraft in identifying and avoiding collision with a utility-scale wind energy facility.\n\n(5) \"Repowering\" means a rebuild or refurbishment of a turbine or facility that is required due to the turbine or facility reaching the end of its useful life or useful reasonable economic life.
