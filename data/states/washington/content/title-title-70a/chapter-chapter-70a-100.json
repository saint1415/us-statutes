Such a plan shall include provisions for subsequently updating the plan. In areas where more than one water system exists, a coordinated plan may consist of either: (a) A new plan developed for the area following its designation as a critical water supply service area; or (b) a compilation of compatible water system plans existing at the time of such designation and containing such supplementary provisions as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. Any such coordinated plan must include provisions regarding: Future service area designations; assessment of the feasibility of shared source, transmission, and storage facilities; emergency inter-ties; design standards; and other concerns related to the construction and operation of the water system facilities.(2) \"Critical water supply service area\" means a geographical area which is characterized by a proliferation of small, inadequate water systems, or by water supply problems which threaten the present or future water quality or reliability of service in such a manner that efficient and orderly development may best be achieved through coordinated planning by the water utilities in the area.(3) \"Public water system\" means any system providing water intended for, or used for, human consumption or other domestic uses. It includes, but is not limited to, the source, treatment for purifying purposes only, storage, transmission, pumping, and distribution facilities where water is furnished to any community, or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use, but excluding water systems serving one single-family residence. However, systems existing on September 21, 1977 which are owner operated and serve less than ten single-family residences or which serve only one industrial plant shall be excluded from this definition and the provisions of this chapter.(4) \"Purveyor\" means any agency or subdivision of the state or any municipal corporation, firm, company, mutual or cooperative association, institution, partnership, or person or any other entity, that owns or operates for wholesale or retail service a public water system. It also means the authorized agents of any such entities.(5) \"Secretary\" means the secretary of the department of health or the secretary's authorized representative.(6) \"Service area\" means a specific geographical area serviced or for which service is planned by a purveyor.\n\nUnless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following terms when used in this chapter shall be defined as follows:\n\n(1) \"Coordinated water system plan\" means a plan for public water systems within a critical water supply service area which identifies the present and future needs of the systems and sets forth means for meeting those needs in the most efficient manner possible.

In order to achieve these objectives, the state shall provide adequate funding from both general state funds and funding directly from the regulated water system;(6) The public health services improvement plan recommends that the principal public health functions in Washington, including regulation of public water systems, should be fully funded by state revenues and undertaken by local jurisdictions with the capacity to perform them; and(7) State government, local governments, water suppliers, and other interested parties should work for continuing economic growth of the state by maximizing the use of existing water supply management alternatives, including regional water systems, satellite management, and coordinated water system development.\" [ 1995 c 376 s 1.]\n\nFindings—1995 c 376: \"The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) Protection of the state's water resources, and utilization of such resources for provision of public water supplies, requires more efficient and effective management than is currently provided under state law;\n\n(2) The provision of public water supplies to the people of the state should be undertaken in a manner that is consistent with the planning principles of the growth management act and the comprehensive plans adopted by local governments under the growth management act;\n\n(3) Small water systems have inherent difficulties with proper planning, operation, financing, management and maintenance. The ability of such systems to provide safe and reliable supplies to their customers on a long-term basis needs to be assured through proper management and training of operators;\n\n(4) New water quality standards and operational requirements for public water systems will soon generate higher rates for the customers of those systems, which may be difficult for customers to afford to pay. It is in the best interest of the people of this state that small systems maintain themselves in a financially viable condition;\n\n(5) The drinking water 2000 task force has recommended maintaining a strong and properly funded statewide drinking water program, retaining primary responsibility for administering the federal safe drinking water act in Washington. The task force has further recommended delegation of as many water system regulatory functions as possible to local governments, with provision of adequate resources and elimination of barriers to such delegation. In order to achieve these objectives, the state shall provide adequate funding from both general state funds and funding directly from the regulated water system;\n\n(6) The public health services improvement plan recommends that the principal public health functions in Washington, including regulation of public water systems, should be fully funded by state revenues and undertaken by local jurisdictions with the capacity to perform them; and\n\n(7) State government, local governments, water suppliers, and other interested parties should work for continuing economic growth of the state by maximizing the use of existing water supply management alternatives, including regional water systems, satellite management, and coordinated water system development.\" [ 1995 c 376 s 1.]",
