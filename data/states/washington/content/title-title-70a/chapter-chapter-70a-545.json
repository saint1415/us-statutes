(Expires July 1, 2030.)\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to create a state financial assurance program that adequately protects public health and safety and the environment from impacts due to petroleum underground storage tank system releases and meets the federal requirements for financial assurance so that a petroleum release will be appropriately addressed. The program focuses on prevention of releases, responsiveness to any release, and emphasizes remediation of releases in areas of risk for drinking water impacts or to equitably protect human health and the environment in communities that are marginalized, overburdened, and underserved. The program is administered by the pollution liability insurance agency.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to create a state financial assurance program that adequately protects public health and safety and the environment from impacts due to petroleum underground storage tank system releases and meets the federal requirements for financial assurance so that a petroleum release will be appropriately addressed.

If the petroleum underground storage tank facility owner is unknown or if a mailed notice is returned as undeliverable, the agency shall provide notice by posting a legal notice in the newspaper of largest circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice must provide:\n\n(i) A statement of the purpose of the lien;\n\n(ii) A brief description of the real property to be affected by the lien; and\n\n(iii) A statement of the remedial action costs incurred or repayments demanded by the agency.\n\n(b) If the agency has reason to believe that exigent circumstances require the filing of a lien prior to giving notice under this subsection, the agency may file the lien immediately. Exigent circumstances include, but are not limited to, an imminent bankruptcy filing by the petroleum underground storage tank facility owner or the imminent transfer or sale of the real property subject to lien by the petroleum underground storage tank facility owner, or both.\n\n(3) A lien filed under this section is effective when a statement of lien is filed with the county auditor in the county where the petroleum underground storage tank is located. The statement of lien must include a description of the real property subject to lien and the amount of the lien.\n\n(4) Unless the agency determines it is in the public interest to remove the lien, the lien continues until the liabilities for the remedial action costs incurred or repayments demanded by the agency have been satisfied through sale of the real property, foreclosure, or other means agreed to by the agency. Any action for foreclosure of the lien must be brought by the attorney general in a civil action in the court having jurisdiction and in the manner prescribed for judicial foreclosure of a mortgage under chapter 61.24 RCW.\n\n(5) The agency may not file a lien under this section against a petroleum underground storage tank owned by a local government.\n\n[ 2023 c 170 s 8.]",
