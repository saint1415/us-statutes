For the purposes of compliance with this subsection (3)(b)(iii), a battery stewardship organization and the department may rely upon new or updated designations of urban locations by the United States census bureau that are determined by the department to be similar to the definition of urban areas in RCW 70A.555.010;\n\n(iv) Collection opportunities for portable batteries at special locations where batteries are often spent and replaced, such as supervised locations at parks with stores and campgrounds; and\n\n(v) Service to areas without a permanent collection site, including service to island and geographically isolated communities without a permanent collection site.\n\n(c) For medium format batteries, a battery stewardship organization must provide statewide collection opportunities that include, but are not limited to, the provision of:\n\n(i) At least 25 permanent collection sites in Washington;\n\n(ii) Reasonable geographic dispersion of collection sites throughout the state;\n\n(iii) A collection site in each county of at least 200,000 persons, as determined by the most recent population estimate of the office of financial management;\n\n(iv) The establishment of collection sites that are accessible to public transit and that are convenient to overburdened communities identified by the department under chapter 70A.02 RCW; and\n\n(v) Service to areas without a permanent collection site, including service to island and geographically isolated communities. A battery stewardship organization must ensure that there is a collection site or annual collection event in each county of the state. Collection events should be provided periodically throughout the year where practicable, but must be provided at least once per year at a minimum in each county in which there are not permanent collection sites providing for the collection of damaged and defective batteries.\n\n(4)(a) Battery stewardship programs must use existing public and private waste collection services and facilities, including battery collection sites that are established through other battery collection services, transporters, consolidators, processors, and retailers, where cost-effective, mutually agreeable, and otherwise practicable.\n\n(b)(i) Battery stewardship programs must use as a collection site for covered batteries any retailer, wholesaler, municipality, solid waste management facility, or other entity that meets the criteria for collection sites in the approved plan, upon the submission of a request by the entity to the battery stewardship organization to serve as a collection site.\n\n(ii) Battery stewardship programs must use as a site for a collection event for covered batteries any retailer, wholesaler, municipality, solid waste management facility, or other entity that meets the criteria for collection events in the approved plan, upon the submission of a request by the entity to the battery stewardship organization to serve as a site for a collection event. A signed agreement between a battery stewardship organization and the entity requesting to hold a collection event must be established at least 60 days prior to any collection of covered batteries under a stewardship program. All costs associated with collection events initiated by an entity other than a battery stewardship organization are the sole responsibility of the entity unless otherwise agreed upon by a battery stewardship organization. A collection event under this subsection (4)(b)(ii) must allow any person to discard each chemistry and brand of covered battery at the collection event.\n\n(c)(i) A local government facility may collect batteries at its own expense through a collection site or temporary collection event that is not a collection site or event under the program implemented by a battery stewardship organization. A local government facility that collects covered batteries under this subsection must, in accordance with procedures set forth in battery stewardship organization plans approved by the department:\n\n(A) Notify battery stewardship organizations of the local government facility's decision to operate a collection site that is not a collection site under a program established under this chapter;\n\n(B) Collect each chemistry and brand of covered battery at its collection site or sites;\n\n(C) Collect, sort, and package collected materials in a manner that meets the standards established in a battery stewardship organization plan approved by the department;\n\n(D) Either provide the collected batteries to the battery stewardship organization in lawful transportation containers for it to transfer the collected batteries at a processing facility the battery stewardship organization has approved, or transport to, or arrange for the transportation of collected batteries for processing at a facility that a battery stewardship organization has approved under a plan approved by the department.\n\n(ii) A local government facility that collects materials at a collection site or temporary collection event operating outside of a battery stewardship program must also report, to a battery stewardship organization, information necessary for the battery stewardship organization to fulfill its reporting obligations under RCW 70A.555.090. A battery stewardship organization may count materials collected by a local government facility under this subsection (4)(c) towards the achievement of performance requirements established in RCW 70A.555.050.\n\n(d) A battery stewardship organization may suspend or terminate a collection site or service that does not adhere to the collection site criteria in the approved plan or that poses an immediate health and safety concern.\n\n(5)(a) Stewardship programs are not required to provide for the collection of battery-containing products.\n\n(b) Stewardship programs are not required to provide for the collection of batteries that:\n\n(i) Are not easily removable from the product other than by the manufacturer; and\n\n(ii) Remain contained in a battery-containing product at the time of delivery to a collection site.\n\n(c) Stewardship programs are required to provide for the collection of loose batteries.\n\n(d) Stewardship programs are not required to provide for the collection of batteries still contained in covered electronic products under chapter 70A.500 RCW.\n\n(6) Batteries collected by the program must be managed consistent with the battery management hierarchy. Lower priority end-of-life battery management options on the battery management hierarchy may be used by a program only when a battery stewardship organization documents to the department that all higher priority battery management options on the battery management hierarchy are not technologically feasible or economically practical.\n\n[ 2023 c 434 s 8.]",

A person who fails to take corrective action as specified in a compliance order is liable for a civil penalty as provided in (b) of this subsection, without receiving a written warning prescribed in (e) of this subsection.\n\n(d) A person who is issued an order or incurs a penalty under this section may appeal the order or penalty to the pollution control hearings board established by chapter 43.21B RCW.\n\n(e) Prior to imposing penalties under this section, the department must provide a producer, retailer, or battery stewardship organization with a written warning for the first violation by the producer, retailer, or battery stewardship organization of the requirements of this chapter. The written warning must inform a producer, retailer, or battery stewardship organization that it must participate in an approved plan or otherwise come into compliance with the requirements of this chapter within 30 days of the notice. A producer, retailer, or battery stewardship organization that violates a provision of this chapter after the initial written warning may be assessed a penalty as provided in this subsection.\n\n(3) Penalties levied under subsection (2) of this section must be deposited in the model toxics control operating account created in RCW 70A.305.180.\n\n(4) No penalty may be assessed on an individual or resident for the improper disposal of covered batteries as described in RCW 70A.555.140 in a noncommercial or residential setting.\n\n[ 2023 c 434 s 12.]",
