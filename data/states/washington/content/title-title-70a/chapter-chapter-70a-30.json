Air pollution causes or contributes to premature death, cancer, asthma, and heart and lung disease. Over half of the state's population suffers from one or more medical conditions that make them very vulnerable to air pollution. Air pollution increases pain and suffering for vulnerable individuals. Air pollution imposes several hundred million dollars annually in added health care costs for air pollution-associated death and illness, reducing the quality of life and economic security of the citizens of Washington;(3) Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources are necessary, and it is equitable to seek such reductions because reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have already been initiated in other sectors such as power generation;(4) Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions made under this act should be credited toward any future federal, state, or regional comprehensive regulatory structure enacted to address reducing greenhouse gas emissions;(5) Under the federal clean air act, the state of Washington has the option to implement either federal motor vehicle emission standards or California motor vehicle emission standards for passenger cars, light duty trucks, and medium duty passenger vehicles;(6) Opting into the California motor vehicle standards will provide significant and necessary air quality benefits to residents of the state of Washington; and(7) Adoption of the California motor vehicle standards will increase consumer choices of cleaner vehicles, provide better warranties to consumers, and provide sufficient air quality benefit to allow additional business and economic growth in the key airsheds of the state while maintaining conformance with federal air quality standards.\" [ 2005 c 295 s 1.]\n\nFindings—2005 c 295: \"The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) Motor vehicles are the largest source of air pollution in the state of Washington, and motor vehicles contribute approximately fifty-seven percent of criteria air pollutant emissions, eighty percent of air toxics emissions, and fifty-five percent of greenhouse gas emissions;\n\n(2) Air pollution levels routinely measured in the state of Washington continue to harm public health, the environment, and the economy.
