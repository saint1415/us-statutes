Many of these chemicals have been identified by the state of Washington as high priority chemicals of concern.(2) In order to ensure the safety of cosmetic products and protect Washington residents from toxic exposures, the legislature intends to prohibit use of toxic chemicals found in cosmetic and personal care products and join other jurisdictions in creating a safer global standard for cosmetic products and bringing more sustainable, safer ingredients to the marketplace.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that certain chemicals used in cosmetic products are linked to harmful impacts on health, such as cancer, birth defects, damage to the reproductive system, organ system toxicity, and endocrine disruption.
