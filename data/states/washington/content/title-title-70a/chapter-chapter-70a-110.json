The increased input of human-influenced nutrients, especially nitrogen, is a factor causing this low-dissolved oxygen condition in some of Puget Sound's waters, in addition to such natural factors as poor overall water circulation and stratification that discourages mixing of surface-to-deeper waters;(2) A significant portion of the state's residents live in homes served by on-site sewage disposal systems, and many new residences will be served by these systems;(3) Properly functioning on-site sewage disposal systems largely protect water quality. However, improperly functioning on-site sewage disposal systems in marine recovery areas may contaminate surface water, causing public health problems;(4) Local programs designed to identify and correct failing on-site sewage disposal systems have proven effective in reducing and eliminating public health hazards, improving water quality, and reopening previously closed shellfish areas; and(5) State water quality monitoring data and analysis can help to focus these enhanced local programs on specific geographic areas that are sources of pollutants degrading Puget Sound waters.Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to authorize enhanced local programs in marine recovery areas to inventory existing on-site sewage disposal systems, to identify the location of all on-site sewage disposal systems in marine recovery areas, to require inspection of on-site sewage disposal systems and repairs to failing systems, to develop electronic data systems capable of sharing information regarding on-site sewage disposal systems, and to monitor these programs to ensure that they are working to protect public health and Puget Sound water quality.\n\nThe legislature finds that:\n\n(1) Hood Canal and other marine waters in Puget Sound are at risk of severe loss of marine life from low-dissolved oxygen.
