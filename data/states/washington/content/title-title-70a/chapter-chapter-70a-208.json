It is also intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the authority of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.(c) It is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.(3) It is the intent of the legislature for the 2029 legislature to consider the draft plans submitted by producer responsibility organizations to the department of ecology in October 2028, prior to the approval of such plans by the department of ecology taking effect.

The funded amount must be:\n\n(i) At least $5,000,000 beginning in 2029 and adjusted annually thereafter for inflation. The producer responsibility organization must use the consumer price index for urban wage earners to calculate the annual rate of inflation adjustment effective January 1st of each year; and\n\n(ii) Sufficient to achieve the reuse and return rate targets and requirements established in RCW 70A.208.150. If at any point the department determines that reuse and return rate targets or statewide requirements are not met, each producer responsibility organization must increase annual contributions to and expenditures from the reuse financial assistance program.\n\n(b) Entities eligible for reuse financial assistance include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) Government entities;\n\n(ii) Tribal governments;\n\n(iii) Nonprofit organizations; and\n\n(iv) Private organizations.\n\n(c) In administering the reuse financial assistance program, the producer responsibility organization must solicit applications using an open and competitive process and must select applications through an evaluation that considers criteria including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) The environmental benefits of the activity;\n\n(ii) The human health benefits of the activity;\n\n(iii) The social and economic benefits of the activity;\n\n(iv) The cost-effectiveness of the activity; and\n\n(v) The needs of economically distressed or overburdened communities.\n\n(d) The producer responsibility organization must consult with the advisory council in determining the criteria in (c) of this subsection, evaluating and selecting applications, and in administering the reuse financial assistance program under this subsection.\n\n(6) A producer responsibility organization may not include on its board of directors, or otherwise be governed by, representatives or affiliates of any public or private entities that submit bids to perform work for the producer responsibility organization or that contract with the producer responsibility organization.\n\n(7) The activities authorized by this chapter require collaboration among producers. These activities will enable the waste reduction, collection, recycling, composting, and disposal of covered materials in Washington and are therefore in the best interest of the public. The benefits of collaboration, together with active state supervision, outweigh potential adverse impacts. Therefore, the legislature exempts from state antitrust laws, and provides immunity through the state action doctrine from federal antitrust laws, activities that are undertaken in compliance with and pursuant to this chapter, including activities that are reviewed or approved by the department, that might otherwise be constrained by such laws. The legislature does not intend and does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities not provided for by this chapter, and the legislature neither exempts nor provides immunity for such activities.\n\n[ 2025 c 316 s 104.]",

For purposes of plan implementation after the first plan approved by the department expires, the department may allow registration of more than one producer responsibility organization.\n\n(4)(a) By March 31, 2027, and every March 31st thereafter, the department must determine a total annual registration fee to be paid by each producer responsibility organization that is adequate to cover, but not exceed, the costs to implement, administer, and enforce this chapter, including the costs determined by the department of labor and industries to implement and enforce RCW 49.46.380, in the next fiscal year.\n\n(b) By 2028, the department must adopt rules to equitably determine annual registration fees by producer responsibility organizations if the department has approved the registration of more than one producer responsibility organization;\n\n(i) Until rules are adopted under (b) of this subsection, issue a general order to all registered producer responsibility organizations; and\n\n(ii) Send notice to each producer responsibility organization of fee amounts due, consistent with either the general order issued under (b)(i) of this subsection or rules adopted under (b) of this subsection.\n\n(c) The department must:\n\n(i) In the March 31, 2027, producer responsibility organization annual registration fee determination under (a) of this subsection, adjust the fee to account for funds received that were due by September 1, 2026, under RCW 70A.208.040;\n\n(ii) Apply any remaining annual fee payment funds from the most recently closed fiscal year to the annual fee for the coming fiscal year, if the collected annual fee exceeds the costs identified under (b) of this subsection for the most recently closed fiscal year; and\n\n(iii) Increase annual fees for the coming fiscal year to cover the costs identified under (b) of this subsection, if the collected annual fee was less than the amount required to cover those costs for a given year.\n\n(c) [(d)] By March 1, 2026, the department must determine the one-time payment to be paid by each producer responsibility organization that is adequate to cover, but not exceed, the costs to implement, administer, and enforce this chapter from July 27, 2025, until June 30, 2027.\n\n(5) Within 120 days of receipt, the department must review and approve, approve with conditions, deny, or request additional information for a draft plan or draft amendment, including a contingency plan as required in RCW 70A.208.140, submitted by a producer responsibility organization or coordinating body.\n\n(a) The department must post the draft plan or plan amendment on the department's website, notify the appropriate committees of the legislature that a draft plan has been submitted and posted, and allow public comment for no less than 45 days before approving, denying, or requesting additional information on the draft plan or amendment.\n\n(b)(i) If the department denies or requests additional information for a draft plan or amendment, the department must provide the producer responsibility organization with the reasons, in writing, that the plan or amendment does not meet the plan requirements of RCW 70A.208.130. The producer responsibility organization has 60 days from the date that the rejection or request for additional information is received to submit to the department any additional information necessary for the department's approval. The department must review and approve or disapprove the revised draft plan or amendment no later than 60 days after the department receives it. If the department disapproves the revised plan or revised plan amendment, the department shall provide the reason, in writing, and either: (A) Direct changes to the revised plan or plan amendment; or (B) require the producer responsibility organization to submit a second revision no later than 60 days from the date of the rejection.\n\n(ii) The department may approve the second revision submitted by the producer responsibility organization with additional conditions the producer responsibility organization must implement.\n\n(c) The department's approval of the first producer responsibility organization plans submitted by October 1, 2028, must take effect no earlier than the adjournment of the 2029 regular legislative session, in order to allow an opportunity for the 2029 legislature to determine whether to amend the requirements of this chapter, to make other recycling policy changes including the potential establishment of a bottle deposit return program, or to allow that the proposed plan and program under this chapter be implemented in full. Nothing in this subsection (5)(c) amends or limits the duties or authorities of a producer, a producer responsibility organization, or the department under this chapter, including with respect to the timing of plan submission, plan review, or plan revision processes specified in this section, while the 2029 legislature reviews the draft plan submitted to the department as provided in this subsection. Nothing in this subsection prevents a plan from being implemented in absence of legislative action after July 27, 2025.\n\n(d) Upon recommendation of the advisory council, or upon the department's initiative, the department may require an amendment to the plan if the department determines that an amendment is necessary to ensure that the producer responsibility organization maintains compliance with the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(6) The department must review annual reports and:\n\n(a) Make annual reports available for public review and comment for at least 30 days;\n\n(b) Review within 120 days of receipt of a complete annual report;\n\n(c) Determine whether an annual report meets the requirements of this chapter, considering comments received under (a) of this subsection, and notify the producer responsibility organization of the approval or reasons for denial. The producer responsibility organization must submit a revised annual report within 60 days after receipt of a denial letter; and\n\n(d) Notify a producer responsibility organization if the annual report demonstrates that a plan fails to achieve the requirements under this chapter.\n\n(7) Upon request of the department for purposes of determining compliance with this chapter, or for purposes of implementing this chapter, a person must furnish to the department any information that the person has or may reasonably obtain.\n\n[ 2025 c 316 s 106.]",

Performance targets must include reuse rates, return rates, recycling rates for materials delivered to responsible markets, composting rates, and targets for plastic source reduction and postconsumer recycled content by covered materials type, as applicable. For products for which postconsumer recycled content rates are established in RCW 70A.245.010 through 70A.245.050 and 70A.245.090 (1), (2), and (4), those rates must be included in an approved plan. The producer responsibility organization must propose the unit or units that are most appropriate to measure each performance target as informed by the needs assessment.(2) The department may require that a producer responsibility organization obtain third-party certification of any activity or achievement of any performance target required by this chapter if a third-party certification is readily available, deemed applicable, and of reasonable cost. The department must provide the producer responsibility organization with notice of at least one year prior to requiring use of third-party certification under this subsection.(3) Proposed targets must demonstrate continuous improvement in reducing environmental impacts and human health impacts of covered materials over time.(4) For purposes of determining whether recycling performance targets are being met, except as modified by the department, a plan must provide a methodology for measuring the amount of covered material sent for recycling at the point at which material leaves a material recovery facility or other processing facility and must account for:(a) Levels and types of estimated contamination documented by the facility;(b) Any exclusions for fuel or energy capture; and(c) Compliance with all state laws pertaining to toxic substances in covered materials.(5)(a) The department must, in consultation with representatives from overburdened communities, the advisory council, service providers, municipalities, state agencies, alternative recycling technology providers, and others, approve or deny a proposal by a producer responsibility organization to count towards recycling performance targets the materials sent to facilities that use an alternative recycling process for conversion of plastic covered materials for the purpose of producing recycled material.(b) The department must establish a process by which a producer responsibility organization may annually propose to count towards recycling performance targets the materials sent to a facility that uses an alternative recycling process.(c) The department may only approve the producer responsibility organization's proposal to count towards recycling performance targets the materials sent to a facility that uses an alternative recycling process if the department determines that the alternative recycling process:(i) Does not include combustion, fuel production, and other forms of energy recovery of plastic covered materials in processing or disposal;(ii) Provides protection for the environment and human health with consideration of inputs and outputs, including as measured against all of the following criteria:(A) Environmental release of air and water pollutants or any hazardous pollutants;(B) Generation of hazardous waste;(C) Energy use and generation of greenhouse gases;(D) Environmental impacts on overburdened communities and socially vulnerable populations;(E) Water usage including, but not limited to, impacts to local water resources and sewage infrastructure;(F) Public health impacts; and(G) Capture and recycling rates;(iii) Reduces gaps in collection, recycling, and composting services at covered entities;(iv) Meets an unmet need in the state that will result in meeting recycling performance targets, including creating new recycling markets for materials currently disposed of in landfills or incinerated;(v) Provides third-party certification of recycled content; and(vi) Addresses those other environmental impacts as determined by the department.(d)(i) In making its determination under (c) of this subsection, the department must take into consideration any local, state, or federal environmental permitting requirements that govern the operation of an alternative recycling process that reduces air and water pollutants or the generation of hazardous waste or pollutants. The department must also take into consideration whether the alternative process produces food-grade or pharmaceutical-grade recycled content.(ii) The department must publish a determination on the producer responsibility organization's proposal, detailing why it was approved or denied and how it measured against the criteria listed in (c) of this subsection.

If the facility fails to meet the requirements of this section, the department shall prohibit the producer responsibility organization from counting material sent to the alternative recycling facility towards recycling performance targets.(g) Nothing in this chapter prohibits or affects the use of any alternative recycling process for products or packaging that are not covered materials under this chapter.(6) For purposes of determining whether plastic source reduction performance targets are being met, a plan must provide a methodology for measuring the amount of plastic source reduction of covered materials in a manner that can be used to determine the extent to which the amount of material used for a covered material can be reduced to what is necessary to efficiently deliver a product without damage or spoilage, or other means of covered material redesign to reduce overall use and environmental impacts and maintain recyclability, compostability, or reusability. No more than eight percent of a producer responsibility organization's plastic source reduction performance target may be met by switching from virgin covered material to postconsumer recycled content through a sliding scale alternative compliance formula developed by the department based on the ratio of virgin plastic to postconsumer recycled plastic. For producers subject to the postconsumer recycled content requirements of chapter 70A.245 RCW, the postconsumer recycled content used to comply with those requirements may be credited towards the plastic source reduction performance target, subject to the eight percent limit.(7) For purposes of determining whether reuse performance targets are being met, a plan must provide a methodology for measuring the amount of reusable covered materials at the point at which reusable covered materials meet the following criteria as demonstrated by the producer and approved by the department whether the:(a) Average minimum number of cycles of reuses within a recognized reuse system has been met based on the number of times an item must be reused for it to have lower environmental impacts than the single-use versions of those items based on accepted industry standards; and(b) Demonstrated or research-based anticipated return rate of the covered material to the reuse system has been met.(8) For purposes of determining whether postconsumer recycled content performance targets are being met under this chapter, a plan must provide a methodology for measuring postconsumer recycled content across all producers for a covered materials type where producers may determine their postconsumer recycled content based on their United States market territory if state-specific postconsumer recycled content is impractical to determine.(9) For other performance targets, the producer responsibility organization must propose methodologies for review and approval as part of the plan based on findings from the needs assessment.(10)(a) The department must establish statewide requirements and a date by which those requirements must be met for each of the following categories:(i) Recycling rate;(ii) Composting rate;(iii) Reuse rate;(iv) Return rate;(v) The percentage of covered materials introduced that must be plastic source reduced; and(vi) The percentage of postconsumer recycled content that covered materials must contain, including an overall percentage for all covered materials, as applicable, excluding compostable materials that cannot include postconsumer recycled content due to unique chemical or physical properties or health or safety requirements that prohibit introduction of postconsumer recycled content.(b) The department may use the following information and criteria when establishing statewide requirements under (a) of this subsection:(i) The needs assessment;(ii) The goals and requirements of chapter 70A.205 RCW;(iii) The greenhouse gas emissions limits of chapter 70A.45 RCW;(iv) The need for continuous progress towards overall reduction in the generation of covered materials waste, the reuse, recycling, or composting of covered materials to reduce environmental impacts and human health impacts, and progress to incorporate postconsumer recycled content to replace virgin materials and support more regional markets;(v) A preference for statewide requirements that accomplish and further the goals and requirements in (b)(ii) through (iv) of this subsection as soon as practicable and to the maximum extent achievable; and(vi) Information from packaging and paper product producer responsibility programs operating in other jurisdictions.(c) The department must consult with producer responsibility organizations on establishing statewide requirements, submit proposed statewide requirements for review by the advisory council, and consider the advisory council's recommendations before finalizing the statewide requirements.(d) Every five years, the department must review the statewide requirements established under this subsection. If the department decides an update is not warranted at that time, the department must submit the reasoning to the advisory council and consider the advisory council's recommendations before making a final decision. If the department decides an update is warranted, the department must follow the process specified in (b) and (c) of this subsection.(e) Producer responsibility organizations must ensure the statewide requirements are met.\n\n(1) Each producer responsibility organization must propose performance targets based on the needs assessment that meet the statewide requirements in subsection (10) of this section that must be included in an approved plan.
