As used in this chapter, market development consists of public and private activities that are used to overcome impediments preventing full and productive use of secondary materials diverted from the waste stream, and that encourage and expand use of those materials and subsequent products. In fulfilling this mission, the center must initially direct its services to businesses that transform or remanufacture waste materials into usable or marketable materials or products for use rather than disposal.(3) The center must perform the following activities:(a) Develop an annual work plan. The work plan must describe actions and recommendations for developing markets for commodities comprising a significant percentage of the waste stream and having potential for use as an industrial or commercial feedstock, with initial focus on mixed waste paper and plastics;(b) Evaluate, analyze, and make recommendations on state policies that may affect markets for recyclable materials. Such recommendations must include explicit consideration of the costs and benefits of the market-effecting policies, including estimates of the anticipated: Rate impacts on solid waste utility ratepayers; impacts on the prices of consumer goods affected by the recommended policies; and impacts on rates of recycling or utilization of postconsumer materials;(c) Work with manufacturers and producers of packaging and other potentially recyclable materials on their work to increase the ability of their products to be recycled or reduced in Washington;(d) Initiate, conduct, or contract for studies relating to market development for recyclable materials, including but not limited to applied research, technology transfer, life-cycle analysis, and pilot demonstration projects;(e) Obtain and disseminate information relating to market development for recyclable materials from other state and local agencies and other sources;(f) Contract with individuals, corporations, trade associations, and research institutions for the purposes of this chapter;(g) Provide grants or contracts to local governments, state agencies, or other public institutions to further the development or revitalization of recycling markets in accordance with applicable rules and regulations;(h) Provide business and marketing assistance to public and private sector entities within the state;(i) Represent the state in regional and national market development issues and work to create a regional recycling development council that will work across either state or provincial borders, or both;(j) Wherever necessary, the center must work with: Material recovery facility operators; public and private sector recycling and solid waste industries; packaging manufacturers and retailers; local governments; environmental organizations; interested colleges and universities; and state agencies, including the department of commerce and the utilities and transportation commission; and(k) Report to the legislature and the governor each even-numbered year on the progress of achieving the center's purpose and performing the center's activities, including any effects on state recycling rates or rates of utilization of postconsumer materials in manufactured products that can reasonably be attributed, at least in part, to the activities of the center.(4) In order to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter, the department must enter into an interagency agreement with the department of commerce to perform or contract for the following activities:(a) Provide targeted business assistance to recycling businesses, including:(i) Development of business plans;(ii) Market research and planning information;(iii) Referral and information on market conditions; and(iv) Information on new technology and product development;(b) Conduct outreach to negotiate voluntary agreements with manufacturers to increase the use of recycled materials in products and product development;(c) Support, promote, and identify research and development to stimulate new technologies and products using recycled materials;(d) Actively promote manufacturing with recycled commodities, as well as purchasing of recycled products by state agencies consistent with and in addition to the requirements of chapter 43.19A RCW and RCW 39.26.255, local governments, and the private sector;(e) Undertake studies on the unmet capital and other needs of reprocessing and manufacturing firms using recycled materials, such as financing and incentive programs; and(f) Conduct research to understand the waste stream supply chain and incentive strategies for retention, expansion, and attraction of innovative recycling technology businesses.(5) The department may adopt any rules necessary to implement and enforce this chapter including, but not limited to, measures for the center's performance.\n\n(1) The recycling development center is created within the department of ecology.\n\n(2) The purpose of the center is to provide or facilitate basic and applied research and development, marketing, and policy analysis in furthering the development of markets and processing for recycled commodities and products.
