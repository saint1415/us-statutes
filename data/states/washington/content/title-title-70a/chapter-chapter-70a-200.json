Converting all but the most egregious illegal dumping from a criminal act to a civil infraction creates a system of deterrence and penalties that better reflects the magnitude of the act, avoids criminal records for individuals who may be unable to afford appropriate waste management options, and reduces the burden on local criminal justice systems and infrastructures.\" [ 2024 c 231 s 1.]\n\nFindings—2024 c 231: \"(1) The legislature finds that, despite a modern waste disposal infrastructure, the occurrences of unlawful solid waste dumping are an increasing problem on open spaces such as privately and publicly owned forestlands. This irresponsible waste dumping, which often includes hazardous materials, asbestos, derelict boats, junk vehicles, appliances, furniture, and household garbage not only creates significant costs for the landowner, but also creates immediate, and sometimes lasting, environmental and habitat damage and degradation of recreational and aesthetic opportunities.\n\n(2) The legislature further finds that the current enforcement system, which relies on the criminalization of illegal dumping, may not be the most effective, efficient, or just penalty system.

As such, the legislature finds that a higher penalty should be imposed on those who improperly dispose of potentially dangerous products, such as is imposed on those who improperly dispose of tobacco products.(2) The legislature further finds that litter is a nuisance, and, in order to alleviate such a nuisance, counties must be provided statutory authority to declare what shall be a nuisance, to abate a nuisance, and to impose and collect fines upon parties who may create, cause, or commit a nuisance.\" [ 2003 c 337 s 1.]\n\nFindings—2003 c 337: \"(1) The legislature finds that the littering of potentially dangerous products poses a greater danger to the public safety than other classes of litter.
