      "text": "RCW 29B.30.010\n\nFindings—Intent—Rule-making authority. (Effective January 1, 2026.)\n\n(1) The legislature finds that:(a) Timely disclosure to voters of the identity and sources of funding for electioneering communications is vitally important to the integrity of state, local, and judicial elections.(b) Electioneering communications that identify political candidates for state, local, or judicial office and that are distributed 60 days before an election for those offices are intended to influence voters and the outcome of those elections.(c) The state has a compelling interest in providing voters information about electioneering communications in political campaigns concerning candidates for state, local, or judicial office so that voters can be fully informed as to the: (i) Source of support or opposition to those candidates; and (ii) identity of persons attempting to influence the outcome of state, local, and judicial candidate elections.(d) Nondisclosure of financial information about advertising that masquerades as relating only to issues and not to candidate campaigns fosters corruption or the appearance of corruption. These consequences can be substantially avoided by full disclosure of the identity and funding of those persons paying for such advertising.(e) The United States supreme court held in McConnell et al. v. Federal Elections Commission, 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) that speakers seeking to influence elections do not possess an inviolable free speech right to engage in electioneering communications regarding elections, including when issue advocacy is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. Therefore, such election campaign communications can be regulated and the source of funding disclosed.(f) The state has a sufficiently compelling interest in preventing corruption in political campaigns to justify and restore contribution limits and restrictions on the use of soft money in RCW 29B.40.020. Those interests include restoring restrictions on the use of such funds for electioneering communications, as well as the laws preventing circumvention of those limits and restrictions.(2) Based upon the findings in this section, chapter 445, Laws of 2005 is narrowly tailored to accomplish the following and is intended to:(a) Improve the disclosure to voters of information concerning persons and entities seeking to influence state, local, and judicial campaigns through reasonable and effective mechanisms, including improving disclosure of the source, identity, and funding of electioneering communications concerning state, local, and judicial candidate campaigns;(b) Regulate electioneering communications that mention state, local, and judicial candidates and that are broadcast, mailed, erected, distributed, or otherwise published right before the election so that the public knows who is paying for such communications;(c) Reenact and amend the contribution limits in RCW 29B.40.020 (7) and (15) and the restrictions on the use of soft money, including as applied to electioneering communications, as those limits and restrictions were in effect following the passage of chapter 2, Laws of 1993 (Initiative Measure No. 134) and before the state supreme court decision in Washington State Republican Party v. Washington State Public Disclosure Commission, 141 Wn.2d 245, 4 P.3d 808 (2000). The commission is authorized to fully restore the implementation of the limits and restrictions of RCW 29B.40.020 (7) and (15) in light of McConnell et al. v. Federal Elections Commission, 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). The United States supreme court upheld the disclosure and regulation of electioneering communications in political campaigns, including but not limited to issue advocacy that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy; and(d) Authorize the commission to adopt rules to implement chapter 445, Laws of 2005.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that:\n\n(a) Timely disclosure to voters of the identity and sources of funding for electioneering communications is vitally important to the integrity of state, local, and judicial elections.\n\n(b) Electioneering communications that identify political candidates for state, local, or judicial office and that are distributed 60 days before an election for those offices are intended to influence voters and the outcome of those elections.\n\n(c) The state has a compelling interest in providing voters information about electioneering communications in political campaigns concerning candidates for state, local, or judicial office so that voters can be fully informed as to the: (i) Source of support or opposition to those candidates; and (ii) identity of persons attempting to influence the outcome of state, local, and judicial candidate elections.\n\n(d) Nondisclosure of financial information about advertising that masquerades as relating only to issues and not to candidate campaigns fosters corruption or the appearance of corruption.

Paid for by (name, city, state).\" If the advertisement or communication is undertaken by a nonindividual other than a party organization, then the following notation must also be included: \"Top Five Contributors\" followed by a listing of the names of the five persons making the largest aggregate contributions as determined by RCW 29B.30.100(1); and if necessary, the statement \"Top Three Donors to PAC Contributors,\" followed by a listing of the names of the three individuals or entities other than political committees making the largest aggregate contributions to political committees as determined by RCW 29B.30.100(2). Abbreviations may be used to describe contributing entities if the full name of the entity has been clearly spoken previously during the broadcast advertisement.\n\n(5) The following statement shall be clearly spoken in an independent expenditure or electioneering communication transmitted by a method that does not include a visual image: \"No candidate authorized this ad. Paid for by (name, city, state).\" If the independent expenditure or electioneering communication is undertaken by a nonindividual other than a party organization, then the following statement must also be included: \"Top Five Contributors\" followed by a listing of the names of the five persons making the largest contributions as determined by RCW 29B.30.100(1); and if necessary, the statement \"Top Three Donors to PAC Contributors,\" followed by a listing of the names of the three individuals or entities, other than political committees, making the largest aggregate contributions to political committees as determined by RCW 29B.30.100(2). Abbreviations may be used to describe contributing entities if the full name of the entity has been clearly spoken previously during the broadcast advertisement.\n\n(6) Political advertising costing one thousand dollars or more supporting or opposing ballot measures sponsored by a political committee must include the information on the top five contributors and top three contributors, other than political committees, as required by RCW 29B.30.100. A series of political advertising sponsored by the same political committee, each of which is under one thousand dollars, must include the top five contributors and top three contributors, other than political committees, as required by RCW 29B.30.100 once their cumulative value reaches one thousand dollars or more.\n\n(7) Political yard signs are exempt from the requirements of this section that the top five contributors and top three PAC contributors as required by RCW 29B.30.100 be listed on the advertising. In addition, the public disclosure commission shall, by rule, exempt from the identification requirements of this section forms of political advertising such as campaign buttons, balloons, pens, pencils, sky-writing, inscriptions, and other forms of advertising where identification is impractical.\n\n(8) For the purposes of this section, \"yard sign\" means any outdoor sign with dimensions no greater than eight feet by four feet.\n\n[ 2024 c 164 s 437; 2024 c 148 s 1; 2019 c 261 s 3; 2013 c 138 s 1; 2012 c 226 s 1; 2010 c 204 s 505; 2005 c 445 s 9; 1995 c 397 s 19; 1993 c 2 s 22 (Initiative Measure No. 134, approved November 3, 1992); 1984 c 216 s 1.

Both passed with more than seventy-two percent of the popular vote, as well as winning margins in every county in the state.One of the cornerstones of Washington state's campaign finance disclosure laws is the requirement that political advertisements disclose the sponsor and the sponsor's top five donors. Many political action committees have avoided this important transparency requirement by funneling money from political action committee to political action committee so the top five donors listed are deceptive political action committee names rather than the real donors. The legislature finds that this practice, sometimes called \"gray money\" or \"donor washing,\" undermines the intent of Washington state's campaign finance laws and impairs the transparency required for fair elections and a healthy democracy.Therefore, the legislature intends to close this disclosure loophole, increase transparency and accountability, raise the level of discourse, deter corruption, and strengthen confidence in the election process by prohibiting political committees from receiving an overwhelming majority of their funds from one or a combination of political committees.\" [ 2019 c 261 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2019 c 261: \"The legislature finds that the public has the right to know who is contributing to election campaigns in Washington state and that campaign finance disclosure deters corruption, increases public confidence in Washington state elections, raises the level of debate, and strengthens our representative democracy.\n\nThe legislature finds that campaign finance disclosure is overwhelmingly supported by the citizens of Washington state as evidenced by the two initiatives that largely established Washington's current system.
