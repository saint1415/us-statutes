The lienholder may buy at any public sale, and if the collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations the lienholder may buy at private sale.\n\n(1) A lien may be summarily foreclosed by notice and sale as provided in this section. The lienholder may sell or otherwise dispose of the collateral in its existing condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing. The proceeds of disposition shall be applied in the order following to:\n\n(a) The reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling and the like, and to the extent provided for in the agreement and not prohibited by law, the reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;\n\n(b) The satisfaction of indebtedness secured by the lien under which the disposition is made;\n\n(c) The satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the collateral if written notification of demand therefor is received before distribution of the proceeds is completed. If requested by the lienholder, the holder of a subordinate security interest must seasonably furnish reasonable proof of his or her interest, and unless he or she does so, the lienholder need not comply with the demand.\n\n(2) The lienholder shall account to the lien debtor for any surplus, and, unless otherwise agreed, the lien debtor is not liable for any deficiency.\n\n(3) Disposition of the collateral may be by public or private proceedings and may be made by way of one or more contracts. Sale or other disposition may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place, and terms must be commercially reasonable. Unless collateral is perishable or threatens to decline quickly in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, reasonable notification of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made shall be sent by the lienholder to the lien debtor, and to any other person who has a duly filed crop lien, or who has a security interest in the collateral and has duly filed a financing statement indexed in the name of the lien debtor in this state, or who is known by the lienholder to have a security interest or crop lien in the collateral. The lienholder may buy at any public sale, and if the collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations the lienholder may buy at private sale.\n\n[ 1986 c 242 s 8.]",
