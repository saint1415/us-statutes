All other forest practices rules shall be adopted by the board.(c) Forest practices rules shall be administered and enforced by either the department or the local governmental entity as provided in this chapter. Such rules shall be adopted and administered so as to give consideration to all purposes and policies set forth in RCW 76.09.010.(2)(a) The board shall prepare proposed forest practices rules consistent with this section and chapter 34.05 RCW. In addition to any forest practices rules relating to water quality protection proposed by the board, the department of ecology may submit to the board proposed forest practices rules relating to water quality protection.(b)(i) The board shall hold one or more hearings on the proposed rules pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. Any county representative may propose specific forest practices rules relating to problems existing within the county at the hearings.(ii) The board may adopt and the department of ecology may approve such proposals if they find the proposals are consistent with the purposes and policies of this chapter.(3)(a) The board shall incorporate into the forest practices rules those fish protection standards in the rules adopted under chapter 77.55 RCW, as the rules existed on July 10, 2012, that are applicable to activities regulated under the forest practices rules. If fish protection standards are incorporated by reference, the board shall minimize administrative processes by utilizing the exception from the administrative procedures controlling significant legislative rules under RCW 34.05.328(5)(b)(iii) for the incorporation of rules adopted by other state agencies.(b) Thereafter, the board shall incorporate into the forest practices rules any changes to those fish protection standards in the rules adopted under chapter 77.55 RCW that are: (i) Adopted consistent with RCW 77.55.361; and (ii) applicable to activities regulated under the forest practices rules. If fish protection standards are incorporated by reference, the board shall minimize administrative processes by utilizing the exception from the administrative procedures controlling significant legislative rules under RCW 34.05.328(5)(b)(iii) for the incorporation of rules adopted by other state agencies.(c) The board shall establish and maintain technical guidance in the forest practices board manual, as provided under WAC 222-12-090 as it existed on July 10, 2012, to assist with implementation of the standards incorporated into the forest practices rules under this section. The guidance must include best management practices and standard techniques to ensure fish protection.(d) The board must complete the requirements of (a) of this subsection and establish initial technical guidance under (c) of this subsection by December 31, 2013.(4)(a) The board shall establish by rule a program for the acquisition of riparian open space and critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Acquisition must be a conservation easement. Lands eligible for acquisition are forestlands within unconfined channel migration zones or forestlands containing critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Once acquired, these lands may be held and managed by the department, transferred to another state agency, transferred to an appropriate local government agency, or transferred to a private nonprofit nature conservancy corporation, as defined in RCW 64.04.130, in fee or transfer of management obligation. The board shall adopt rules governing the acquisition by the state or donation to the state of such interest in lands including the right of refusal if the lands are subject to unacceptable liabilities. The rules shall include definitions of qualifying lands, priorities for acquisition, and provide for the opportunity to transfer such lands with limited warranties and with a description of boundaries that does not require full surveys where the cost of securing the surveys would be unreasonable in relation to the value of the lands conveyed. The rules shall provide for the management of the lands for ecological protection or fisheries enhancement. For the purposes of conservation easements entered into under this section, the following apply:(i) For conveyances of a conservation easement in which the landowner conveys an interest in the trees only, the compensation must include the timber value component, as determined by the cruised volume of any timber located within the channel migration zone or critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board, multiplied by the appropriate quality code stumpage value for timber of the same species shown on the appropriate table used for timber harvest excise tax purposes under RCW 84.33.091;(ii) For conveyances of a conservation easement in which the landowner conveys interests in both land and trees, the compensation must include the timber value component in (a)(i) of this subsection plus such portion of the land value component as determined just and equitable by the department. The land value component must be the acreage of qualifying channel migration zone or critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as determined by the board, to be conveyed, multiplied by the average per acre value of all commercial forestland in western Washington or the average for eastern Washington, whichever average is applicable to the qualifying lands. The department must determine the western and eastern Washington averages based on the land value tables established by RCW 84.33.140 and revised annually by the department of revenue.(b) Subject to appropriations sufficient to cover the cost of such an acquisition program and the related costs of administering the program, the department must establish a conservation easement in land that an owner tenders for purchase; provided that such lands have been taxed as forestlands and are located within an unconfined channel migration zone or contain critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Lands acquired under this section shall become riparian or habitat open space. These acquisitions shall not be deemed to trigger the compensating tax of chapters 84.33 and 84.34 RCW.(c) Instead of offering to sell interests in qualifying lands, owners may elect to donate the interests to the state.(d) Any acquired interest in qualifying lands by the state under this section shall be managed as riparian open space or critical habitat.\n\n(1)(a) Where necessary to accomplish the purposes and policies stated in RCW 76.09.010, and to implement the provisions of this chapter, the board shall adopt forest practices rules pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW and in accordance with the procedures enumerated in this section that:\n\n(i) Establish minimum standards for forest practices;\n\n(ii) Provide procedures for the voluntary development of resource management plans which may be adopted as an alternative to the minimum standards in (a)(i) of this subsection if the plan is consistent with the purposes and policies stated in RCW 76.09.010 and the plan meets or exceeds the objectives of the minimum standards;\n\n(iii) Set forth necessary administrative provisions;\n\n(iv) Establish procedures for the collection and administration of forest practice fees as set forth by this chapter; and\n\n(v) Allow for the development of watershed analyses.\n\n(b) Forest practices rules pertaining to water quality protection shall be adopted by the board after reaching agreement with the director of the department of ecology or the director's designee on the board with respect to these rules. All other forest practices rules shall be adopted by the board.\n\n(c) Forest practices rules shall be administered and enforced by either the department or the local governmental entity as provided in this chapter. Such rules shall be adopted and administered so as to give consideration to all purposes and policies set forth in RCW 76.09.010.\n\n(2)(a) The board shall prepare proposed forest practices rules consistent with this section and chapter 34.05 RCW. In addition to any forest practices rules relating to water quality protection proposed by the board, the department of ecology may submit to the board proposed forest practices rules relating to water quality protection.\n\n(b)(i) The board shall hold one or more hearings on the proposed rules pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. Any county representative may propose specific forest practices rules relating to problems existing within the county at the hearings.\n\n(ii) The board may adopt and the department of ecology may approve such proposals if they find the proposals are consistent with the purposes and policies of this chapter.\n\n(3)(a) The board shall incorporate into the forest practices rules those fish protection standards in the rules adopted under chapter 77.55 RCW, as the rules existed on July 10, 2012, that are applicable to activities regulated under the forest practices rules.

However, the work may not begin until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department. Class II shall not include forest practices:(a) On forestlands that are being converted to another use;(b) Within \"shorelines of the state\" as defined in RCW 90.58.030;(c) Excluded from Class II by the board; or(d) Including timber harvesting or road construction within \"urban growth areas,\" designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, which are Class IV;Class III: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I, II, or IV. A Class III application must be approved or disapproved by the department according to the following timelines; however, the applicant may not begin work on the forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department:(a) Within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application if the application is not subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490; and(b) Within thirty days of the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife if the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490;Class IV: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I or II:(a) On forestlands that are being converted to another use;(b) On lands which, pursuant to RCW 76.09.070 as now or hereafter amended, are not to be reforested because of the likelihood of future conversion to urban development;(c) That involve timber harvesting or road construction on forestlands that are contained within \"urban growth areas,\" designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, except where the forestland owner provides:(i) A written statement of intent signed by the forestland owner not to convert to a use other than commercial forest product operations for ten years, accompanied by either a written forest management plan acceptable to the department or documentation that the land is enrolled under the provisions of chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW; or(ii) A conversion option harvest plan approved by the local governmental entity and submitted to the department as part of the application; and/or(d) Which have a potential for a substantial impact on the environment and therefore require an evaluation by the department as to whether or not a detailed statement must be prepared pursuant to the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW. Such evaluation shall be made within the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.037; however, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any local or regional governmental entity from determining that a detailed statement must be prepared for an action pursuant to a Class IV forest practice taken by that governmental entity concerning the land on which forest practices will be conducted. Unless the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, a Class IV application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application. If a Class IV application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, then the application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife. However, the department may extend the timelines applicable to the approval or disapproval of the application an additional thirty calendar days if the department determines that a detailed statement must be made, unless the commissioner of public lands, through the promulgation of a formal order, determines that the process cannot be completed within such a period. However, the applicant may not begin work on that forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department.Forest practices under Classes I, II, and III are exempt from the requirements for preparation of a detailed statement under the state environmental policy act.(2) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, no Class II, Class III, or Class IV forest practice shall be commenced or continued after January 1, 1975, unless the department has received a notification with regard to a Class II forest practice or approved an application with regard to a Class III or Class IV forest practice containing all information required by RCW 76.09.060 as now or hereafter amended. However, in the event forest practices regulations necessary for the scheduled implementation of this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 have not been adopted in time to meet such schedules, the department shall have the authority to regulate forest practices and approve applications on such terms and conditions consistent with this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 and the purposes and policies of RCW 76.09.010 until applicable forest practices regulations are in effect.(3) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, if a notification or application is delivered in person to the department by the operator or the operator's agent, the department shall immediately provide a dated receipt thereof. In all other cases, the department shall immediately mail a dated receipt to the operator.(4) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, forest practices shall be conducted in accordance with the forest practices regulations, orders and directives as authorized by this chapter or the forest practices regulations, and the terms and conditions of any approved applications.(5) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, the department of natural resources shall notify the applicant in writing of either its approval of the application or its disapproval of the application and the specific manner in which the application fails to comply with the provisions of this section or with the forest practices regulations. Except as provided otherwise in this section, if the department fails to either approve or disapprove an application or any portion thereof within the applicable time limit, the application shall be deemed approved and the operation may be commenced: PROVIDED, That this provision shall not apply to applications which are neither approved nor disapproved pursuant to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That if seasonal field conditions prevent the department from being able to properly evaluate the application, the department may issue an approval conditional upon further review within sixty days. Upon receipt of any notification or any satisfactorily completed application the department shall in any event no later than two business days after such receipt transmit a copy to the departments of ecology and fish and wildlife, and to the county, city, or town in whose jurisdiction the forest practice is to be commenced. Any comments by such agencies shall be directed to the department of natural resources.(6) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, if the county, city, or town believes that an application is inconsistent with this chapter, the forest practices regulations, or any local authority consistent with RCW 76.09.240 as now or hereafter amended, it may so notify the department and the applicant, specifying its objections.(7) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, the department shall not approve portions of applications to which a county, city, or town objects if:(a) The department receives written notice from the county, city, or town of such objections within fourteen business days from the time of transmittal of the application to the county, city, or town, or one day before the department acts on the application, whichever is later; and(b) The objections relate to forestlands that are being converted to another use.The department shall either disapprove those portions of such application or appeal the county, city, or town objections to the appeals board. If the objections related to (b) of this subsection are based on local authority consistent with RCW 76.09.240 as now or hereafter amended, the department shall disapprove the application until such time as the county, city, or town consents to its approval or such disapproval is reversed on appeal. The applicant shall be a party to all department appeals of county, city, or town objections. Unless the county, city, or town either consents or has waived its rights under this subsection, the department shall not approve portions of an application affecting such lands until the minimum time for county, city, or town objections has expired.(8) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, in addition to any rights under the above paragraph, the county, city, or town may appeal any department approval of an application with respect to any lands within its jurisdiction. The appeals board may suspend the department's approval in whole or in part pending such appeal where there exists potential for immediate and material damage to a public resource.(9) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, appeals under this section shall be made to the appeals board in the manner and time provided in RCW 76.09.205. In such appeals there shall be no presumption of correctness of either the county, city, or town or the department position.(10) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, the department shall, within four business days notify the county, city, or town of all notifications, approvals, and disapprovals of an application affecting lands within the county, city, or town, except to the extent the county, city, or town has waived its right to such notice.(11) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, a county, city, or town may waive in whole or in part its rights under this section, and may withdraw or modify any such waiver, at any time by written notice to the department.(12) Notwithstanding subsections (2) through (5) of this section, forest practices applications or notifications are not required for exotic insect and disease control operations conducted in accordance with RCW 76.09.060(8) where eradication can reasonably be expected.\n\n(1) The board shall establish by rule which forest practices shall be included within each of the following classes:\n\nClass I: Minimal or specific forest practices that have no direct potential for damaging a public resource and that may be conducted without submitting an application or a notification except that when the regulating authority is transferred to a local governmental entity, those Class I forest practices that involve timber harvesting or road construction within \"urban growth areas,\" designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, are processed as Class IV forest practices, but are not subject to environmental review under chapter 43.21C RCW;\n\nClass II: Forest practices which have a less than ordinary potential for damaging a public resource that may be conducted without submitting an application and may begin five calendar days, or such lesser time as the department may determine, after written notification by the operator, in the manner, content, and form as prescribed by the department, is received by the department. However, the work may not begin until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department. Class II shall not include forest practices:\n\n(a) On forestlands that are being converted to another use;\n\n(b) Within \"shorelines of the state\" as defined in RCW 90.58.030;\n\n(c) Excluded from Class II by the board; or\n\n(d) Including timber harvesting or road construction within \"urban growth areas,\" designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, which are Class IV;\n\nClass III: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I, II, or IV. A Class III application must be approved or disapproved by the department according to the following timelines; however, the applicant may not begin work on the forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department:\n\n(a) Within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application if the application is not subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490; and\n\n(b) Within thirty days of the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife if the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490;\n\nClass IV: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I or II:\n\n(a) On forestlands that are being converted to another use;\n\n(b) On lands which, pursuant to RCW 76.09.070 as now or hereafter amended, are not to be reforested because of the likelihood of future conversion to urban development;\n\n(c) That involve timber harvesting or road construction on forestlands that are contained within \"urban growth areas,\" designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, except where the forestland owner provides:\n\n(i) A written statement of intent signed by the forestland owner not to convert to a use other than commercial forest product operations for ten years, accompanied by either a written forest management plan acceptable to the department or documentation that the land is enrolled under the provisions of chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW; or\n\n(ii) A conversion option harvest plan approved by the local governmental entity and submitted to the department as part of the application; and/or\n\n(d) Which have a potential for a substantial impact on the environment and therefore require an evaluation by the department as to whether or not a detailed statement must be prepared pursuant to the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW. Such evaluation shall be made within the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.037; however, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any local or regional governmental entity from determining that a detailed statement must be prepared for an action pursuant to a Class IV forest practice taken by that governmental entity concerning the land on which forest practices will be conducted. Unless the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, a Class IV application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application. If a Class IV application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, then the application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife. However, the department may extend the timelines applicable to the approval or disapproval of the application an additional thirty calendar days if the department determines that a detailed statement must be made, unless the commissioner of public lands, through the promulgation of a formal order, determines that the process cannot be completed within such a period. However, the applicant may not begin work on that forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department.\n\nForest practices under Classes I, II, and III are exempt from the requirements for preparation of a detailed statement under the state environmental policy act.\n\n(2) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, no Class II, Class III, or Class IV forest practice shall be commenced or continued after January 1, 1975, unless the department has received a notification with regard to a Class II forest practice or approved an application with regard to a Class III or Class IV forest practice containing all information required by RCW 76.09.060 as now or hereafter amended. However, in the event forest practices regulations necessary for the scheduled implementation of this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 have not been adopted in time to meet such schedules, the department shall have the authority to regulate forest practices and approve applications on such terms and conditions consistent with this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 and the purposes and policies of RCW 76.09.010 until applicable forest practices regulations are in effect.\n\n(3) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, if a notification or application is delivered in person to the department by the operator or the operator's agent, the department shall immediately provide a dated receipt thereof. In all other cases, the department shall immediately mail a dated receipt to the operator.\n\n(4) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, forest practices shall be conducted in accordance with the forest practices regulations, orders and directives as authorized by this chapter or the forest practices regulations, and the terms and conditions of any approved applications.\n\n(5) Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, the department of natural resources shall notify the applicant in writing of either its approval of the application or its disapproval of the application and the specific manner in which the application fails to comply with the provisions of this section or with the forest practices regulations. Except as provided otherwise in this section, if the department fails to either approve or disapprove an application or any portion thereof within the applicable time limit, the application shall be deemed approved and the operation may be commenced: PROVIDED, That this provision shall not apply to applications which are neither approved nor disapproved pursuant to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That if seasonal field conditions prevent the department from being able to properly evaluate the application, the department may issue an approval conditional upon further review within sixty days. Upon receipt of any notification or any satisfactorily completed application the department shall in any event no later than two business days after such receipt transmit a copy to the departments of ecology and fish and wildlife, and to the county, city, or town in whose jurisdiction the forest practice is to be commenced. Any comments by such agencies shall be directed to the department of natural resources.\n\n(6) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, if the county, city, or town believes that an application is inconsistent with this chapter, the forest practices regulations, or any local authority consistent with RCW 76.09.240 as now or hereafter amended, it may so notify the department and the applicant, specifying its objections.\n\n(7) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, the department shall not approve portions of applications to which a county, city, or town objects if:\n\n(a) The department receives written notice from the county, city, or town of such objections within fourteen business days from the time of transmittal of the application to the county, city, or town, or one day before the department acts on the application, whichever is later; and\n\n(b) The objections relate to forestlands that are being converted to another use.\n\nThe department shall either disapprove those portions of such application or appeal the county, city, or town objections to the appeals board. If the objections related to (b) of this subsection are based on local authority consistent with RCW 76.09.240 as now or hereafter amended, the department shall disapprove the application until such time as the county, city, or town consents to its approval or such disapproval is reversed on appeal. The applicant shall be a party to all department appeals of county, city, or town objections. Unless the county, city, or town either consents or has waived its rights under this subsection, the department shall not approve portions of an application affecting such lands until the minimum time for county, city, or town objections has expired.\n\n(8) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, in addition to any rights under the above paragraph, the county, city, or town may appeal any department approval of an application with respect to any lands within its jurisdiction. The appeals board may suspend the department's approval in whole or in part pending such appeal where there exists potential for immediate and material damage to a public resource.\n\n(9) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, appeals under this section shall be made to the appeals board in the manner and time provided in RCW 76.09.205. In such appeals there shall be no presumption of correctness of either the county, city, or town or the department position.\n\n(10) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, the department shall, within four business days notify the county, city, or town of all notifications, approvals, and disapprovals of an application affecting lands within the county, city, or town, except to the extent the county, city, or town has waived its right to such notice.\n\n(11) For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, a county, city, or town may waive in whole or in part its rights under this section, and may withdraw or modify any such waiver, at any time by written notice to the department.\n\n(12) Notwithstanding subsections (2) through (5) of this section, forest practices applications or notifications are not required for exotic insect and disease control operations conducted in accordance with RCW 76.09.060(8) where eradication can reasonably be expected.\n\n[ 2012 1st sp.s. c 1 s 205; 2011 c 207 s 1; 2010 c 210 s 20; 2005 c 146 s 1003; 2003 c 314 s 4; 2002 c 121 s 1; 1997 c 173 s 2; 1994 c 264 s 49; 1993 c 443 s 3; 1990 1st ex.s. c 17 s 61; 1988 c 36 s 47; 1987 c 95 s 9; 1975 1st ex.s. c 200 s 2; 1974 ex.s. c 137 s 5.]\n\nContingent effective date—2012 1st sp.s. c 1 ss 202 and 205: See note following RCW 76.09.490.\n\nContingent effective date—2012 1st sp.s. c 1 ss 202 and 205: See note following RCW 76.09.490.\n\nFinding—Intent—Limitation—Jurisdiction/authority of Indian tribe under act—2012 1st sp.s. c 1: See notes following RCW 77.55.011.\n\nFinding—Intent—Limitation—Jurisdiction/authority of Indian tribe under act—2012 1st sp.s. c 1: See notes following RCW 77.55.011.\n\nAuthority of department of fish and wildlife under act—2012 1st sp.s. c 1: See note following RCW 76.09.040.\n\nAuthority of department of fish and wildlife under act—2012 1st sp.s. c 1: See note following RCW 76.09.040.\n\nIntent—Effective dates—Application—Pending cases and rules—2010 c 210: See notes following RCW 43.21B.001.\n\nIntent—Effective dates—Application—Pending cases and rules—2010 c 210: See notes following RCW 43.21B.001.\n\nPart headings not law—2005 c 146: See note following RCW 77.55.011.\n\nPart headings not law—2005 c 146: See note following RCW 77.55.011.\n\nFindings—2003 c 314: See note following RCW 17.24.220.\n\nFindings—2003 c 314: See note following RCW 17.24.220.\n\nEffective date—1993 c 443: See note following RCW 76.09.010.\n\nEffective date—1993 c 443: See note following RCW 76.09.010.\n\nSeverability—Part, section headings not law—1990 1st ex.s. c 17: See RCW 36.70A.900 and 36.70A.901.\n\nSeverability—Part, section headings not law—1990 1st ex.s. c 17: See RCW 36.70A.900 and 36.70A.901.",

A renewal application or notification is subject to the forest practices rules in effect at the time the renewal application or notification is filed. Nothing in this section precludes the applicant from applying for a new application or notification after the renewal period has lapsed.(c) At the option of the applicant, an application or notification may be submitted to cover a single forest practice or a number of forest practices within reasonable geographic or political boundaries as specified by the department. An application or notification that covers more than one forest practice may have an effective term of more than three years.(d) The board shall adopt rules that establish standards and procedures for approving an application or notification that has an effective term of more than three years. Such rules shall include extended time periods for application or notification approval or disapproval. The department may require the applicant to provide advance notice before commencing operations on an approved application or notification.(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no prior application or notification shall be required for any emergency forest practice necessitated by fire, flood, windstorm, earthquake, or other emergency as defined by the board, but the operator shall submit an application or notification, whichever is applicable, to the department within forty-eight hours after commencement of such practice or as required by local regulations.(8) Forest practices applications or notifications are not required for forest practices conducted to control exotic forest insect or disease outbreaks, when conducted by or under the direction of the department of agriculture in carrying out an order of the governor or director of the department of agriculture to implement pest control measures as authorized under chapter 17.24 RCW, and are not required when conducted by or under the direction of the department in carrying out emergency measures under a forest health emergency declaration by the commissioner of public lands as provided in RCW 76.06.130.(a) For the purposes of this subsection, exotic forest insect or disease has the same meaning as defined in RCW 76.06.020.(b) In order to minimize adverse impacts to public resources, control measures must be based on integrated pest management, as defined in RCW 17.15.010, and must follow forest practices rules relating to road construction and maintenance, timber harvest, and forest chemicals, to the extent possible without compromising control objectives.(c) Agencies conducting or directing control efforts must provide advance notice to the appropriate regulatory staff of the department of the operations that would be subject to exemption from forest practices application or notification requirements.(d) When the appropriate regulatory staff of the department are notified under (c) of this subsection, they must consult with the landowner, interested agencies, and affected tribes, and assist the notifying agencies in the development of integrated pest management plans that comply with forest practices rules as required under (b) of this subsection.(e) Nothing under this subsection relieves agencies conducting or directing control efforts from requirements of the federal clean water act as administered by the department of ecology under RCW 90.48.260.(f) Forestlands where trees have been cut as part of an exotic forest insect or disease control effort under this subsection are subject to reforestation requirements under RCW 76.09.070.(g) The exemption from obtaining approved forest practices applications or notifications does not apply to forest practices conducted after the governor, the director of the department of agriculture, or the commissioner of public lands have declared that an emergency no longer exists because control objectives have been met, that there is no longer an imminent threat, or that there is no longer a good likelihood of control.\n\n(1) The department shall prescribe the form and contents of the notification and application. The forest practices rules shall specify by whom and under what conditions the notification and application shall be signed or otherwise certified as acceptable.

A renewal application or notification is subject to the forest practices rules in effect at the time the renewal application or notification is filed. Nothing in this section precludes the applicant from applying for a new application or notification after the renewal period has lapsed.\n\n(c) At the option of the applicant, an application or notification may be submitted to cover a single forest practice or a number of forest practices within reasonable geographic or political boundaries as specified by the department. An application or notification that covers more than one forest practice may have an effective term of more than three years.\n\n(d) The board shall adopt rules that establish standards and procedures for approving an application or notification that has an effective term of more than three years. Such rules shall include extended time periods for application or notification approval or disapproval. The department may require the applicant to provide advance notice before commencing operations on an approved application or notification.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no prior application or notification shall be required for any emergency forest practice necessitated by fire, flood, windstorm, earthquake, or other emergency as defined by the board, but the operator shall submit an application or notification, whichever is applicable, to the department within forty-eight hours after commencement of such practice or as required by local regulations.\n\n(8) Forest practices applications or notifications are not required for forest practices conducted to control exotic forest insect or disease outbreaks, when conducted by or under the direction of the department of agriculture in carrying out an order of the governor or director of the department of agriculture to implement pest control measures as authorized under chapter 17.24 RCW, and are not required when conducted by or under the direction of the department in carrying out emergency measures under a forest health emergency declaration by the commissioner of public lands as provided in RCW 76.06.130.\n\n(a) For the purposes of this subsection, exotic forest insect or disease has the same meaning as defined in RCW 76.06.020.\n\n(b) In order to minimize adverse impacts to public resources, control measures must be based on integrated pest management, as defined in RCW 17.15.010, and must follow forest practices rules relating to road construction and maintenance, timber harvest, and forest chemicals, to the extent possible without compromising control objectives.\n\n(c) Agencies conducting or directing control efforts must provide advance notice to the appropriate regulatory staff of the department of the operations that would be subject to exemption from forest practices application or notification requirements.\n\n(d) When the appropriate regulatory staff of the department are notified under (c) of this subsection, they must consult with the landowner, interested agencies, and affected tribes, and assist the notifying agencies in the development of integrated pest management plans that comply with forest practices rules as required under (b) of this subsection.\n\n(e) Nothing under this subsection relieves agencies conducting or directing control efforts from requirements of the federal clean water act as administered by the department of ecology under RCW 90.48.260.\n\n(f) Forestlands where trees have been cut as part of an exotic forest insect or disease control effort under this subsection are subject to reforestation requirements under RCW 76.09.070.\n\n(g) The exemption from obtaining approved forest practices applications or notifications does not apply to forest practices conducted after the governor, the director of the department of agriculture, or the commissioner of public lands have declared that an emergency no longer exists because control objectives have been met, that there is no longer an imminent threat, or that there is no longer a good likelihood of control.\n\n[ 2012 1st sp.s. c 1 s 206.

The legislature also recognizes the importance of long-term habitat productivity for natural and wild fish, for the protection of hatchery water supplies, and for the protection of water quality and quantity to meet the needs of people, fish, and wildlife. The legislature recognizes the importance of maintaining and enhancing fish and wildlife habitats capable of sustaining the commercial and noncommercial uses of fish and wildlife. The legislature further recognizes the importance of the continued growth and development of the state's forest products industry which has a vital stake in the long-term productivity of both the public and private forestland base.The development of a landscape planning system would help achieve these goals. Landowners and resource managers should be provided incentives to voluntarily develop long-term multispecies landscape management plans that will provide protection to public resources. Because landscape planning represents a departure from the use of standard baseline rules and may result in unintended consequences to both the affected habitats and to a landowner's economic interests, the legislature desires to establish up to seven experimental pilot programs to gain experience with landscape planning that may prove useful in fashioning legislation of a more general application.(1) Until December 31, 2000, the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, is granted authority to select not more than seven pilot projects for the purpose of developing individual landowner multispecies landscape management plans.(a) Pilot project participants must be selected by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, no later than October 1, 1997.(b) The number and the location of the pilot projects are to be determined by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, and should be selected on the basis of risk to the habitat and species, variety and importance of species and habitats in the planning area, geographic distribution, surrounding ownership, other ongoing landscape and watershed planning activities in the area, potential benefits to water quantity and quality, financial and staffing capabilities of participants, and other factors that will contribute to the creation of landowner multispecies landscape planning efforts.(c) Each pilot project shall have a landscape management plan with the following elements:(i) An identification of public resources selected for coverage under the plan and measurable objectives for the protection of the selected public resources;(ii) A termination date of not later than 2050;(iii) A general description of the planning area including its geographic location, physical and biological features, habitats, and species known to be present;(iv) An identification of the existing forest practices rules that will not apply during the term of the plan;(v) Proposed habitat management strategies or prescriptions;(vi) A projection of the habitat conditions likely to result from the implementation of the specified management strategies or prescriptions;(vii) An assessment of habitat requirements and the current habitat conditions of representative species included in the plan;(viii) An assessment of potential or likely impacts to representative species resulting from the prescribed forest practices;(ix) A description of the anticipated benefits to those species or other species as a result of plan implementation;(x) A monitoring plan;(xi) Reporting requirements including a schedule for review of the plan's performance in meeting its objectives;(xii) Conditions under which a plan may be modified, including a procedure for adaptive management;(xiii) Conditions under which a plan may be terminated;(xiv) A procedure for adaptive management that evaluates the effectiveness of the plan to meet its measurable public resources objectives, reflects changes in the best available science, and provides changes to its habitat management strategies, prescriptions, and hydraulic project standards to the extent agreed to in the plan and in a timely manner and schedule;(xv) A description of how the plan relates to publicly available plans of adjacent federal, state, tribal, and private timberland owners; and(xvi) A statement of whether the landowner intends to apply for approval of the plan under applicable federal law.(2) Until December 31, 2000, the department, in agreement with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner elects to cover water quality in the plan, shall approve a landscape management plan and enter into a binding implementation agreement with the landowner when such departments find, based upon the best scientific data available, that:(a) The plan contains all of the elements required under this section including measurable public resource objectives;(b) The plan is expected to be effective in meeting those objectives;(c) The landowner has sufficient financial resources to implement the management strategies or prescriptions to be implemented by the landowner under the plan;(d) The plan will:(i) Provide better protection than current state law for the public resources selected for coverage under the plan considered in the aggregate; and(ii) Compared to conditions that could result from compliance with current state law:(A) Not result in poorer habitat conditions over the life of the plan for any species selected for coverage that is listed as threatened or endangered under federal or state law, or that has been identified as a candidate for such listing, at the time the plan is approved; and(B) Measurably improve habitat conditions for species selected for special consideration under the plan;(e) The plan shall include watershed analysis or provide for a level of protection that meets or exceeds the protection that would be provided by watershed analysis, if the landowner selects fish or water quality as a public resource to be covered under the plan. Any alternative process to watershed analysis would be subject to timely peer review;(f) The planning process provides for a public participation process during the development of the plan, which shall be developed by the department in cooperation with the landowner.The management plans must be submitted to the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner elects to cover water quality in the plan, no later than March 1, 2000. The department shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed plan. The comment period shall not be less than forty-five days. The department shall approve or reject plans within one hundred twenty days of submittal by the landowner of a final plan. The decision by the department, in agreement with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner has elected to cover water quality in the plan, to approve or disapprove the management plan is subject to the environmental review process of chapter 43.21C RCW, provided that any public comment period provided for under chapter 43.21C RCW shall run concurrently with the public comment period provided in this subsection (2).(3) After a landscape management plan is adopted:(a) Forest practices consistent with the plan need not comply with:(i) The specific forest practices rules identified in the plan; and(ii) Any forest practice rules and policies adopted after the approval of the plan to the extent that the rules:(A) Have been adopted primarily for the protection of a public resource selected for coverage under the plan; or(B) Provide for procedural or administrative obligations inconsistent with or in addition to those provided for in the plan with respect to those public resources; and(b) If the landowner has selected fish as one of the public resources to be covered under the plan, the plan shall serve as the hydraulic project approval for the life of the plan, in compliance with *RCW 77.55.100.(4) The department is authorized to issue a single landscape level permit valid for the life of the plan to a landowner who has an approved landscape management plan and who has requested a landscape permit from the department. Landowners receiving a landscape level permit shall meet annually with the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology where water quality has been selected as a public resource to be covered under the plan, to review the specific forest practices activities planned for the next twelve months and to determine whether such activities are in compliance with the plan. The departments will consult with the affected Indian tribes and other interested parties who have expressed an interest in connection with the review. The landowner is to provide ten calendar days' notice to the department prior to the commencement of any forest practices authorized under a landscape level permit. The landscape level permit will not impose additional conditions relating to the public resources selected for coverage under the plan beyond those agreed to in the plan. For the purposes of chapter 43.21C RCW, forest practices conducted in compliance with an approved plan are deemed not to have the potential for a substantial impact on the environment as to any public resource selected for coverage under the plan.(5) Except as otherwise provided in a plan, the agreement implementing the landscape management plan is an agreement that runs with the property covered by the approved landscape management plan and the department shall record notice of the plan in the real property records of the counties in which the affected properties are located. Prior to its termination, no plan shall permit forestland covered by its terms to be withdrawn from such coverage, whether by sale, exchange, or other means, nor to be converted to nonforestry uses except to the extent that such withdrawal or conversion would not measurably impair the achievement of the plan's stated public resource objectives. If a participant transfers all or part of its interest in the property, the terms of the plan still apply to the new landowner for the plan's stated duration unless the plan is terminated under its terms or unless the plan specifies the conditions under which the terms of the plan do not apply to the new landowner.(6) The departments of natural resources, fish and wildlife, and ecology shall seek to develop memorandums of agreements with federal agencies and affected Indian tribes relating to tribal issues in the landscape management plans. The departments shall solicit input from affected Indian tribes in connection with the selection, review, and approval of any landscape management plan. If any recommendation is received from an affected Indian tribe and is not adopted by the departments, the departments shall provide a written explanation of their reasons for not adopting the recommendation.(7) The department is directed to report to the forest practices board annually through the year 2000, but no later than December 31st of each year, on the status of each pilot project. The department is directed to provide to the forest practices board, no later than December 31, 2000, an evaluation of the pilot projects including a determination if a permanent landscape planning process should be established along with a discussion of what legislative and rule modifications are necessary.\n\nThe legislature recognizes the importance of providing the greatest diversity of habitats, particularly riparian, wetland, and old growth habitats, and of assuring the greatest diversity of species within those habitats for the survival and reproduction of enough individuals to maintain the native wildlife of Washington forestlands.

Alternate plans should provide protection to public resources at least equal in overall effectiveness by alternate means.\n\n(4) Rule making under subsection (2) of this section shall be completed by June 30, 2001.\n\n(5) The board should consider coordinating any environmental review process under chapter 43.21C RCW relating to the adoption of rules under subsection (2) of this section with any review of a related proposal under the national environmental policy act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321, et seq.).\n\n(6) After the board has adopted permanent rules under subsection (2) of this section, changes to those rules and any new rules covering aquatic resources may be adopted by the board but only if the changes or new rules are consistent with recommendations resulting from the scientifically based adaptive management process established by a rule of the board. Any new rules or changes under this subsection need not be based upon the recommendations of the adaptive management process if: (a) The board is required to adopt or modify rules by the final order of any court having jurisdiction thereof; or (b) future state legislation directs the board to adopt or modify the rules.\n\n(7) In adopting permanent rules, the board shall incorporate the scientific-based adaptive management process described in the forests and fish report which will be used to determine the effectiveness of the new forest practices rules in aiding the state's salmon recovery effort. The purpose of an adaptive management process is to make adjustments as quickly as possible to forest practices that are not achieving the resource objectives. The adaptive management process shall incorporate the best available science and information, include protocols and standards, regular monitoring, a scientific and peer review process, and provide recommendations to the board on proposed changes to forest practices rules to meet timber industry viability and salmon recovery.\n\n[ 1999 sp.s. c 4 s 204.]\n\nPart headings not law—1999 sp.s. c 4: See note following RCW 77.85.180.\n\nPart headings not law—1999 sp.s. c 4: See note following RCW 77.85.180.",

Sec. 1539(a)(1)(A), that seek to provide regulatory incentives for private and other nonfederal property owners to recruit, enhance, or maintain habitats for species that are or may become listed as threatened or endangered. These activities are designed to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species and provide assurance to participating landowners that their future land management activities would not be subject to the endangered species act's restrictions as long as they adhere to the terms of the programmatic safe harbor agreement. The legislature aims to encourage these programs in the forested environment, as they accomplish multiple desirable goals for multiple parties.(2) The legislature recognizes the value of voluntary, incentive-based programs to nonfederal forestland owners to support the northern spotted owl, and finds that this section will facilitate participation in these programs if they can be made more accessible and streamlined.
