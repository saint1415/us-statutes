Cities and communities benefit from assistance in developing and maintaining urban and community forestry programs that also address future growth.(3) Assistance and encouragement in the establishment, retention, and enhancement of these forests and trees by local governments, residents, organizations, and professionals are in the interest of the state based on the contributions these forests make in preserving and enhancing the quality of life of Washington's cities, counties, and tribal lands while providing opportunities for economic development.(4) Well-maintained urban forests deliver local air and water quality benefits that can have positive impacts on human health.(5) Increased tree canopy in urban areas can positively impact salmon populations through stormwater management and reduction of stream temperatures, thereby improving critical salmon habitat.\n\n(1) Trees and other woody vegetation are a necessary and important part of community environments.

The legislature further finds that climate change is impacting our state in numerous ways, including summer heat waves, heavier winter rains, and lower air quality, all of which can be improved by increased tree canopy. The legislature further finds that modern and well-crafted urban forestry programs can have significant additional benefits related to human health, especially when delivered in highly impacted communities with higher health disparities and that also have lower existing tree canopy. Significant research exists demonstrating health benefits of trees and green spaces, including air and water quality improvements, positive emotional responses to being in nature, physical activity, and social cohesion through interacting in public green spaces. Furthermore, the legislature finds that Washington state faces continued urgency in adequately protecting essential salmon habitat, which is necessary to promote salmon recovery and thus help protect our endangered southern resident killer whale population. It is the intent of the legislature to enhance urban forestry programs that maximize cobenefits related to human health and salmon recovery.(2) The legislature further recognizes that the existing evergreen communities act, in chapter 76.15 RCW and related programs in state law, established a successful framework for supporting urban forestry in Washington state. That act established the need for tools including canopy assessment and regional tree canopy analysis, and targeted technical assistance to support cities and counties seeking to deliver impactful urban forestry programs.

Management plans may include, but not be limited to, the following elements:(a) Inventory and assessment of the jurisdiction's urban and community forests utilized as a dynamic management tool to set goals, implement programs, and monitor outcomes that may be adjusted over time;(b) Canopy cover goals;(c) Reforestation and tree canopy expansion goals within the city's, town's, and county's boundaries;(d) Restoration of public forests;(e) Achieving forest stand and diversity goals;(f) Maximizing vegetated stormwater management with trees and other vegetation that reduces runoff, increases soil infiltration, and reduces stormwater pollution;(g) Environmental health goals specific to air quality, habitat for wildlife, and energy conservation;(h) Vegetation management practices and programs to prevent vegetation from interfering with or damaging utilities and public facilities;(i) Prioritizing planting sites;(j) Standards for tree selection, siting, planting, and pruning;(k) Scheduling maintenance and stewardship for new and established trees;(l) Staff and volunteer training requirements emphasizing appropriate expertise and professionalism;(m) Guidelines for protecting existing trees from construction-related damage and damage related to preserving territorial views;(n) Integrating disease and pest management;(o) Wood waste utilization;(p) Community outreach, participation, education programs, and partnerships with nongovernment organizations;(q) Time frames for achieving plan goals, objectives, and tasks;(r) Monitoring and measuring progress toward those benchmarks and goals;(s) Consistency with the urban wildland interface codes developed by the state building code council;(t) Emphasizing landscape and revegetation plans in residential and commercial development areas where tree retention objectives are challenging to achieve; and(u) Maximizing building heating and cooling energy efficiency through appropriate siting of trees for summer shading, passive solar heating in winter, and for wind breaks.(5) The department may use existing tools to assist communities to develop urban forestry ordinances.
