      "text": "RCW 76.13.120\n\nFindings—Definitions—Forestry riparian easement program—Legislative intent.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that the state should acquire easements primarily along riparian and other sensitive aquatic areas from qualifying small forestland owners willing to sell or donate easements to the state provided that the state will not be required to acquire the easements if they are subject to unacceptable liabilities. Therefore the legislature establishes a forestry riparian easement program.(2) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section and RCW 76.13.100, 76.13.110, 76.13.140, and 76.13.160 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(a) \"Forestry riparian easement\" means an easement covering qualifying timber granted voluntarily to the state by a qualifying small forestland owner.(b) \"Qualifying small forestland owner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics as of the date the department offers compensation for a forestry riparian easement:(i) Is a small forestland owner as defined in (d) of this subsection; and(ii) Is an individual, partnership, corporation, or other nongovernmental for-profit legal entity.(c) \"Qualifying timber\" means those forest trees on land owned by a qualifying small forestland owner for which the small forestland owner is willing to grant the state a forestry riparian easement and meets all of the following:(i) The forest trees are covered by a forest practices application that the small forestland owner is required to leave unharvested under the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.040, 76.09.055, and 76.09.370 or that is made uneconomic to harvest by those rules;(ii) The forest trees are within or bordering a commercially reasonable harvest unit as determined under rules adopted by the forest practices board, or for which an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules;(iii) The forest trees are located within, or affected by forest practices rules pertaining to any one, or all, of the following:(A) Riparian or other sensitive aquatic areas;(B) Channel migration zones; or(C) Areas of potentially unstable slopes or landforms, verified by the department, and must meet all of the following:(I) Are addressed in a forest practices application;(II) Are adjacent to a commercially reasonable harvest area; and(III) Have the potential to deliver sediment or debris to a public resource or threaten public safety.(d) \"Small forestland owner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics:(i) A forestland owner as defined in RCW 76.09.020 whose interest in the land and timber is in fee or who has rights to the timber to be included in the forestry riparian easement that extend at least 40 years from the date the completed forestry riparian easement application associated with the easement is submitted;(ii) An entity that has harvested from its own lands in this state during the three years prior to the year of application an average timber volume that would qualify the owner as a small harvester under RCW 84.33.035; and(iii) An entity that certifies at the time of application that it does not expect to harvest from its own lands more than the volume allowed by RCW 84.33.035 during the 10 years following application. If a landowner's prior three-year average harvest exceeds the limit of RCW 84.33.035, or the landowner expects to exceed this limit during the 10 years following application, and that landowner establishes to the department's reasonable satisfaction that the harvest limits were or will be exceeded to raise funds to pay estate taxes or equally compelling and unexpected obligations such as court-ordered judgments or extraordinary medical expenses, the landowner shall be deemed to be a small forestland owner. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies as a small forestland owner, the small forestland owner office, created in RCW 76.13.110, shall evaluate the landowner under this definition, pursuant to RCW 76.13.160, as of the date that the forest practices application is submitted and the date that the department offers compensation for the forestry riparian easement. A small forestland owner can include an individual, partnership, corporation, or other nongovernmental legal entity. If a landowner grants timber rights to another entity for less than five years, the landowner may still qualify as a small forestland owner under this section. If a landowner is unable to obtain an approved forest practices application for timber harvest for any of his or her land because of restrictions under the forest practices rules, the landowner may still qualify as a small forestland owner under this section.(e) \"Completion of harvest\" means that the trees have been commercially harvested from an area and that further entry into that area by mechanized logging or slash treating equipment is not expected.(3) Nothing in the eligibility limit identified in subsection (2)(c)(i) through (iii) of this section precludes inclusion of land in future mitigation programs.(4) The department is authorized and directed to accept and hold in the name of the state of Washington forestry riparian easements granted by qualifying small forestland owners covering qualifying timber and to pay compensation to the landowners in accordance with this section. The department may not transfer the easements to any entity other than another state agency.(5) Forestry riparian easements shall be effective for 40 years from the date of the completed forestry riparian easement application, unless the easement is voluntarily terminated earlier by the department, based on a determination that termination is in the best interest of the state, or under the terms of a termination clause in the easement.(6) Forestry riparian easements shall be restrictive of the timber only, and shall preserve all lawful uses of the easement premises by the landowner that are consistent with the terms of the easement and the requirement to protect riparian functions during the term of the easement, subject to the restriction that the leave trees required by the rules to be left on the easement premises may not be cut during the term of the easement. No right of public access to or across, or any public use of the easement premises is created by this statute or by the easement. Forestry riparian easements shall not be deemed to trigger the compensating tax of or otherwise disqualify land from being taxed under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW.(7) The small forestland owner office shall determine what constitutes a completed application for a forestry riparian easement. An application shall, at a minimum, include documentation of the owner's status as a qualifying small forestland owner, identification of location and the types of qualifying timber, and notification of completion of harvest, if applicable.(8) Upon receipt of the qualifying small forestland owner's forestry riparian easement application, and subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the following must occur:(a) The small forestland owner office must determine the compensation to be offered to the qualifying small forestland owner for qualifying timber after the department accepts the completed forestry riparian easement application and the landowner has completed marking the boundary of the area containing the qualifying timber. The legislature recognizes that there is not readily available market transaction evidence of value for easements of the nature required by this section, and thus establishes the methodology provided in this subsection to ascertain the value for forestry riparian easements. Values so determined may not be considered competent evidence of value for any other purpose.(b) The small forestland owner office, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, is responsible for assessing the volume of qualifying timber. However, no more than 50 percent of the total amounts appropriated for the forestry riparian easement program may be applied to determine the volume of qualifying timber for completed forestry riparian easement applications. Based on the volume established by the small forestland owner office and using data obtained or maintained by the department of revenue under RCW 84.33.074 and 84.33.091, the small forestland owner office shall attempt to determine the fair market value of the qualifying timber as of the date of the completed harvest. To the extent reasonably possible, the forestry riparian easement applications should be processed in the order received. Removal of any qualifying timber before the expiration of the easement must be in accordance with the forest practices rules and the terms of the easement. There shall be no reduction in compensation for reentry.(9)(a) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the small forestland owner office shall offer compensation for qualifying timber to the qualifying small forestland owner in the amount of 90 percent of the value determined by the small forestland owner office, plus the compliance and reimbursement costs as determined in accordance with RCW 76.13.140. However, compensation for any qualifying small forestland owner for qualifying timber located on potentially unstable slopes or landforms may not exceed a total of $150,000 during any biennial funding period.(b) If the landowner accepts the offer for qualifying timber, the department shall pay the compensation promptly upon:(i) Completion of harvest in the area within a commercially reasonable harvest unit with which the forestry riparian easement is associated under an approved forest practices application, unless an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules;(ii) Verification that the landowner has no outstanding violations under chapter 76.09 RCW or any associated rules; and(iii) Execution and delivery of the easement to the department.(c) Upon donation or payment of compensation, the department may record the easement.(10)(a) The forest practices board shall adopt rules under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement the forestry riparian easement program, including the following:(i) A standard version of a forestry riparian easement application as well as all additional documents necessary or advisable to create the forestry riparian easements as provided for in this section;(ii) Standards for descriptions of the easement premises with a degree of precision that is reasonable in relation to the values involved;(iii) Methods and standards for cruises and valuation of forestry riparian easements for purposes of establishing the compensation. The department shall perform the timber cruises of forestry riparian easements required under this chapter and chapter 76.09 RCW. Timber cruises are subject to amounts appropriated for this purpose. However, no more than 50 percent of the total appropriated funding for the forestry riparian easement program may be applied to determine the volume of qualifying timber for completed forestry riparian easement applications. Any rules concerning the methods and standards for valuations of forestry riparian easements shall apply only to the department, qualifying small forestland owners, and the small forestland owner office;(iv) A method to determine that a forest practices application involves a commercially reasonable harvest, and adopt criteria for entering into a forestry riparian easement where a commercially reasonable harvest is not possible or a forest practices application that has been submitted cannot be approved because of restrictions under the forest practices rules;(v) A method to address blowdown of qualified timber falling outside the easement premises;(vi) A formula for sharing of proceeds in relation to the acquisition of qualified timber covered by an easement through the exercise or threats of eminent domain by a federal or state agency with eminent domain authority, based on the present value of the department's and the landowner's relative interests in the qualified timber;(vii) A method to determine timber that is qualifying timber because it is rendered uneconomic to harvest by the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.055 and 76.09.370;(viii) A method for internal department review of small forestland owner office compensation decisions under this section; and(ix) Consistent with RCW 76.13.180, a method to collect reimbursement from landowners who received compensation for a forestry riparian easement and who, within the first 10 years after receipt of compensation for a forestry riparian easement, sells the land on which an easement is located to a nonqualifying landowner.(b) At least semiannually, the department shall consult with the small forestland owner advisory committee established in RCW 76.13.110(4) to review landowner complaints, administrative processes, rule recommendations, and related issues where the department is actively seeking the small forestland owner advisory committee's advice on potential improved efficiencies and effectiveness.(11) The legislature finds that the overall societal benefits of economically viable working forests are multiple, and include the protection of clean, cold water, the provision of wildlife habitat, the sheltering of cultural resources from development, and the natural carbon storage potential of growing trees. As such, working forests and the forestry riparian easement program may be part of the state's overall carbon sequestration strategy. If the state creates a climate strategy, the department must share information regarding the carbon sequestration benefits of the forestry riparian easement program with other state programs using methods and protocols established in the state climate strategy that attempt to quantify carbon storage or account for carbon emissions. The department must promote the expansion of funding for the forestry riparian easement program and the ecosystem services supported by the program based on the findings stated in RCW 76.13.100. Nothing in this subsection allows a landowner to be reimbursed by the state more than once for the same forest riparian easement application.(12) It is the intent of the legislature that the small forestland owner office complete forestry riparian easement program application transactions within two years of the application receipt consistent with the goals of RCW 70A.65.270(2)(b)(iii).\n\n(1) The legislature finds that the state should acquire easements primarily along riparian and other sensitive aquatic areas from qualifying small forestland owners willing to sell or donate easements to the state provided that the state will not be required to acquire the easements if they are subject to unacceptable liabilities. Therefore the legislature establishes a forestry riparian easement program.\n\n(2) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section and RCW 76.13.100, 76.13.110, 76.13.140, and 76.13.160 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n\n(a) \"Forestry riparian easement\" means an easement covering qualifying timber granted voluntarily to the state by a qualifying small forestland owner.\n\n(b) \"Qualifying small forestland owner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics as of the date the department offers compensation for a forestry riparian easement:\n\n(i) Is a small forestland owner as defined in (d) of this subsection; and\n\n(ii) Is an individual, partnership, corporation, or other nongovernmental for-profit legal entity.\n\n(c) \"Qualifying timber\" means those forest trees on land owned by a qualifying small forestland owner for which the small forestland owner is willing to grant the state a forestry riparian easement and meets all of the following:\n\n(i) The forest trees are covered by a forest practices application that the small forestland owner is required to leave unharvested under the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.040, 76.09.055, and 76.09.370 or that is made uneconomic to harvest by those rules;\n\n(ii) The forest trees are within or bordering a commercially reasonable harvest unit as determined under rules adopted by the forest practices board, or for which an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules;\n\n(iii) The forest trees are located within, or affected by forest practices rules pertaining to any one, or all, of the following:\n\n(A) Riparian or other sensitive aquatic areas;\n\n(B) Channel migration zones; or\n\n(C) Areas of potentially unstable slopes or landforms, verified by the department, and must meet all of the following:\n\n(I) Are addressed in a forest practices application;\n\n(II) Are adjacent to a commercially reasonable harvest area; and\n\n(III) Have the potential to deliver sediment or debris to a public resource or threaten public safety.\n\n(d) \"Small forestland owner\" means a landowner meeting all of the following characteristics:\n\n(i) A forestland owner as defined in RCW 76.09.020 whose interest in the land and timber is in fee or who has rights to the timber to be included in the forestry riparian easement that extend at least 40 years from the date the completed forestry riparian easement application associated with the easement is submitted;\n\n(ii) An entity that has harvested from its own lands in this state during the three years prior to the year of application an average timber volume that would qualify the owner as a small harvester under RCW 84.33.035; and\n\n(iii) An entity that certifies at the time of application that it does not expect to harvest from its own lands more than the volume allowed by RCW 84.33.035 during the 10 years following application. If a landowner's prior three-year average harvest exceeds the limit of RCW 84.33.035, or the landowner expects to exceed this limit during the 10 years following application, and that landowner establishes to the department's reasonable satisfaction that the harvest limits were or will be exceeded to raise funds to pay estate taxes or equally compelling and unexpected obligations such as court-ordered judgments or extraordinary medical expenses, the landowner shall be deemed to be a small forestland owner. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies as a small forestland owner, the small forestland owner office, created in RCW 76.13.110, shall evaluate the landowner under this definition, pursuant to RCW 76.13.160, as of the date that the forest practices application is submitted and the date that the department offers compensation for the forestry riparian easement. A small forestland owner can include an individual, partnership, corporation, or other nongovernmental legal entity. If a landowner grants timber rights to another entity for less than five years, the landowner may still qualify as a small forestland owner under this section. If a landowner is unable to obtain an approved forest practices application for timber harvest for any of his or her land because of restrictions under the forest practices rules, the landowner may still qualify as a small forestland owner under this section.\n\n(e) \"Completion of harvest\" means that the trees have been commercially harvested from an area and that further entry into that area by mechanized logging or slash treating equipment is not expected.\n\n(3) Nothing in the eligibility limit identified in subsection (2)(c)(i) through (iii) of this section precludes inclusion of land in future mitigation programs.\n\n(4) The department is authorized and directed to accept and hold in the name of the state of Washington forestry riparian easements granted by qualifying small forestland owners covering qualifying timber and to pay compensation to the landowners in accordance with this section. The department may not transfer the easements to any entity other than another state agency.\n\n(5) Forestry riparian easements shall be effective for 40 years from the date of the completed forestry riparian easement application, unless the easement is voluntarily terminated earlier by the department, based on a determination that termination is in the best interest of the state, or under the terms of a termination clause in the easement.\n\n(6) Forestry riparian easements shall be restrictive of the timber only, and shall preserve all lawful uses of the easement premises by the landowner that are consistent with the terms of the easement and the requirement to protect riparian functions during the term of the easement, subject to the restriction that the leave trees required by the rules to be left on the easement premises may not be cut during the term of the easement. No right of public access to or across, or any public use of the easement premises is created by this statute or by the easement. Forestry riparian easements shall not be deemed to trigger the compensating tax of or otherwise disqualify land from being taxed under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW.\n\n(7) The small forestland owner office shall determine what constitutes a completed application for a forestry riparian easement. An application shall, at a minimum, include documentation of the owner's status as a qualifying small forestland owner, identification of location and the types of qualifying timber, and notification of completion of harvest, if applicable.\n\n(8) Upon receipt of the qualifying small forestland owner's forestry riparian easement application, and subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the following must occur:\n\n(a) The small forestland owner office must determine the compensation to be offered to the qualifying small forestland owner for qualifying timber after the department accepts the completed forestry riparian easement application and the landowner has completed marking the boundary of the area containing the qualifying timber. The legislature recognizes that there is not readily available market transaction evidence of value for easements of the nature required by this section, and thus establishes the methodology provided in this subsection to ascertain the value for forestry riparian easements. Values so determined may not be considered competent evidence of value for any other purpose.\n\n(b) The small forestland owner office, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, is responsible for assessing the volume of qualifying timber. However, no more than 50 percent of the total amounts appropriated for the forestry riparian easement program may be applied to determine the volume of qualifying timber for completed forestry riparian easement applications. Based on the volume established by the small forestland owner office and using data obtained or maintained by the department of revenue under RCW 84.33.074 and 84.33.091, the small forestland owner office shall attempt to determine the fair market value of the qualifying timber as of the date of the completed harvest. To the extent reasonably possible, the forestry riparian easement applications should be processed in the order received. Removal of any qualifying timber before the expiration of the easement must be in accordance with the forest practices rules and the terms of the easement. There shall be no reduction in compensation for reentry.\n\n(9)(a) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the small forestland owner office shall offer compensation for qualifying timber to the qualifying small forestland owner in the amount of 90 percent of the value determined by the small forestland owner office, plus the compliance and reimbursement costs as determined in accordance with RCW 76.13.140. However, compensation for any qualifying small forestland owner for qualifying timber located on potentially unstable slopes or landforms may not exceed a total of $150,000 during any biennial funding period.\n\n(b) If the landowner accepts the offer for qualifying timber, the department shall pay the compensation promptly upon:\n\n(i) Completion of harvest in the area within a commercially reasonable harvest unit with which the forestry riparian easement is associated under an approved forest practices application, unless an approved forest practices application for timber harvest cannot be obtained because of restrictions under the forest practices rules;\n\n(ii) Verification that the landowner has no outstanding violations under chapter 76.09 RCW or any associated rules; and\n\n(iii) Execution and delivery of the easement to the department.\n\n(c) Upon donation or payment of compensation, the department may record the easement.\n\n(10)(a) The forest practices board shall adopt rules under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement the forestry riparian easement program, including the following:\n\n(i) A standard version of a forestry riparian easement application as well as all additional documents necessary or advisable to create the forestry riparian easements as provided for in this section;\n\n(ii) Standards for descriptions of the easement premises with a degree of precision that is reasonable in relation to the values involved;\n\n(iii) Methods and standards for cruises and valuation of forestry riparian easements for purposes of establishing the compensation.

The small forestland owner office and the department of fish and wildlife must work closely with lead entities or other local watershed groups to make maximum use of current information regarding the location and priority of current fish passage barriers. Where additional fish passage barrier inventories are necessary, funding will be sought for the collection of this information. Methods, protocols, and formulas for data gathering and prioritizing must be developed in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife. The department of fish and wildlife must assist in the training and management of fish passage barrier location data collection.(3) The small forestland owner office must actively seek out funding for the program authorized in this section. The small forestland owner office must work with consenting landowners to identify and secure funding from local, state, federal, tribal, or nonprofit habitat restoration organizations and other private sources, including the salmon recovery funding board, the United States department of agriculture, the United States department of transportation, the Washington state department of transportation, the United States department of commerce, and the federal highway administration.(4)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the small forestland owner office, in implementing the program established in this section, must provide the highest proportion of public funding available for the removal or replacement of any fish passage barrier.(b) In no case shall a small forestland owner be required to pay more than the lesser of either: (i) Twenty-five percent of any costs associated with the removal or replacement of a particular fish passage barrier; or (ii) five thousand dollars for the removal or replacement of a particular fish passage barrier. No small forestland owner shall be required to pay more than the maximum total annual costs in (c) of this subsection.(c) The portion of the total cost of removing or replacing fish passage barriers that a small forestland owner must pay in any calendar year shall be determined based on the average annual timber volume harvested from the landowner's lands in this state during the three preceding calendar years, and whether the fish passage barrier is in eastern or western Washington.(i) In western Washington (west of the Cascade Crest), a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume of less than five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of eight thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an annual average timber volume between five hundred thousand and nine hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of sixteen thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume between one million and one million four hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of twenty-four thousand dollars during that calendar year, and a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume greater than or equal to one million five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of thirty-two thousand dollars during that calendar year, regardless of the number of fish passage barriers removed or replaced on the landowner's lands during that calendar year.(ii) In eastern Washington (east of the Cascade Crest), a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume of less than five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of two thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an annual average timber volume between five hundred thousand and nine hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of four thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume between one million and one million four hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of twelve thousand dollars during that calendar year, and a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume greater than or equal to one million five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of sixteen thousand dollars during that calendar year, regardless of the number of fish passage barriers removed or replaced on the landowner's lands during that calendar year.(iii) Maximum total annual costs for small forestland owners with fish passage barriers in both western and eastern Washington shall be those specified under (c)(i) and (ii) of this subsection.(d) If an existing fish passage barrier on land owned by a small forestland owner was installed under an approved forest practices application or notification, and hydraulics approval, and that fish passage barrier becomes a high priority for fish passage based on the watershed ranking in *RCW 76.13.150, one hundred percent public funding shall be provided.(5) If a small forestland owner is required to contribute a portion of the funding under the cost-share program established in this section, that landowner may satisfy his or her required proportion by providing either direct monetary contributions or in-kind services to the project. In-kind services may include labor, equipment, materials, and other landowner-provided services determined by the department to have an appropriate value to the removal of a particular fish passage barrier.(6)(a) The department, using fish passage barrier assessments and ranked inventory information provided by the department of fish and wildlife and the appropriate lead entity as delineated in RCW 77.12.755, must establish a prioritized list for the funding of fish passage barrier removals on property owned by small forestland owners that ensures that funding is provided first to the known fish passage barriers existing on forestland owned by small forestland owners that cause the greatest harm to public resources.(b) As the department collects information about the presence of fish passage barriers from submitted checklists, it must share this information with the department of fish and wildlife and the technical advisory groups established in **RCW 77.85.070. If the addition of the information collected in the checklists or any other changes to the scientific instruments described in RCW 77.12.755 alter the analysis conducted under RCW 77.12.755, the department must alter the funding order appropriately to reflect the new information.(7) The department may accept commitments from small forestland owners that they will participate in the program to remove fish passage barriers from their land at any time, regardless of the funding order given to the fish passage barriers on a particular landowner's property.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that a state-led cost-sharing program is necessary to assist small forestland owners with removing and replacing fish passage barriers that were added to their land prior to May 14, 2003, to help achieve the goals of the forests and fish report, and to assist small forestland owners in complying with the state's fish passage requirements.\n\n(2) The small forestland owner office must, in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, establish a program designed to assist small forestland owners with repairing or removing fish passage barriers and assist lead entities in acquiring the data necessary to fill any gaps in fish passage barrier information.

The small forestland owner office must work with consenting landowners to identify and secure funding from local, state, federal, tribal, or nonprofit habitat restoration organizations and other private sources, including the salmon recovery funding board, the United States department of agriculture, the United States department of transportation, the Washington state department of transportation, the United States department of commerce, and the federal highway administration.\n\n(4)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the small forestland owner office, in implementing the program established in this section, must provide the highest proportion of public funding available for the removal or replacement of any fish passage barrier.\n\n(b) In no case shall a small forestland owner be required to pay more than the lesser of either: (i) Twenty-five percent of any costs associated with the removal or replacement of a particular fish passage barrier; or (ii) five thousand dollars for the removal or replacement of a particular fish passage barrier. No small forestland owner shall be required to pay more than the maximum total annual costs in (c) of this subsection.\n\n(c) The portion of the total cost of removing or replacing fish passage barriers that a small forestland owner must pay in any calendar year shall be determined based on the average annual timber volume harvested from the landowner's lands in this state during the three preceding calendar years, and whether the fish passage barrier is in eastern or western Washington.\n\n(i) In western Washington (west of the Cascade Crest), a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume of less than five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of eight thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an annual average timber volume between five hundred thousand and nine hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of sixteen thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume between one million and one million four hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of twenty-four thousand dollars during that calendar year, and a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume greater than or equal to one million five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of thirty-two thousand dollars during that calendar year, regardless of the number of fish passage barriers removed or replaced on the landowner's lands during that calendar year.\n\n(ii) In eastern Washington (east of the Cascade Crest), a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume of less than five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of two thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an annual average timber volume between five hundred thousand and nine hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of four thousand dollars during that calendar year, a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume between one million and one million four hundred ninety-nine thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of twelve thousand dollars during that calendar year, and a small forestland owner who has harvested an average annual timber volume greater than or equal to one million five hundred thousand board feet shall not be required to pay more than a total of sixteen thousand dollars during that calendar year, regardless of the number of fish passage barriers removed or replaced on the landowner's lands during that calendar year.\n\n(iii) Maximum total annual costs for small forestland owners with fish passage barriers in both western and eastern Washington shall be those specified under (c)(i) and (ii) of this subsection.\n\n(d) If an existing fish passage barrier on land owned by a small forestland owner was installed under an approved forest practices application or notification, and hydraulics approval, and that fish passage barrier becomes a high priority for fish passage based on the watershed ranking in *RCW 76.13.150, one hundred percent public funding shall be provided.\n\n(5) If a small forestland owner is required to contribute a portion of the funding under the cost-share program established in this section, that landowner may satisfy his or her required proportion by providing either direct monetary contributions or in-kind services to the project. In-kind services may include labor, equipment, materials, and other landowner-provided services determined by the department to have an appropriate value to the removal of a particular fish passage barrier.\n\n(6)(a) The department, using fish passage barrier assessments and ranked inventory information provided by the department of fish and wildlife and the appropriate lead entity as delineated in RCW 77.12.755, must establish a prioritized list for the funding of fish passage barrier removals on property owned by small forestland owners that ensures that funding is provided first to the known fish passage barriers existing on forestland owned by small forestland owners that cause the greatest harm to public resources.\n\n(b) As the department collects information about the presence of fish passage barriers from submitted checklists, it must share this information with the department of fish and wildlife and the technical advisory groups established in **RCW 77.85.070. If the addition of the information collected in the checklists or any other changes to the scientific instruments described in RCW 77.12.755 alter the analysis conducted under RCW 77.12.755, the department must alter the funding order appropriately to reflect the new information.\n\n(7) The department may accept commitments from small forestland owners that they will participate in the program to remove fish passage barriers from their land at any time, regardless of the funding order given to the fish passage barriers on a particular landowner's property.\n\n[ 2003 c 311 s 7.]\n\nReviser's note: *(1) The reference to RCW 76.13.150 appears to be erroneous.
