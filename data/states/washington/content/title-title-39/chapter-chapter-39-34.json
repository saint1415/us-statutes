As a result, many are subject to the full range of management interests, including multiple government entities with jurisdiction over water. In many cases, the political boundaries of government do not align with the hydrological boundaries of watersheds and may actually hinder the implementation of coordinated, cooperative plans. Cooperative watershed management actions by local governments, special districts, and utilities can help maintain healthy watershed function and support the beneficial use of water by these entities and protect the quality of the resource that they use or affect. By participating in cooperative watershed management actions, local governments, special districts, and utilities are acting in the public interest and in a manner that is intended to sustain maximum beneficial use and high quality of water over time and to maintain the services that these entities provide.\n\nTherefore, it is the intent of this act to remove statutory barriers that may prevent local governments from working together in the creation and implementation of cooperative, coordinated watershed plans. In addition, it is the further intent of this act to provide additional authorities to assist in such implementation.\" [ 2003 c 327 s 1.]",
