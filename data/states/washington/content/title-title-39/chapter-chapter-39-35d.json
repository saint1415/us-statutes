Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any public agency, public school district, or other entity undertaking a major facility project subject to the requirements of RCW 39.35D.030 or 39.35D.040 are encouraged to design and construct such projects to receive all practical water efficient landscaping credits available under the United States green building council rating system, international green construction code, other nationally recognized consensus standard, or the Washington sustainable school design protocol, as each standard existed on June 11, 2020. Entities undertaking major facility projects may consider costs and potential benefits when determining the practicality of incorporating water efficient landscaping measures into the design and construction of the projects.(b) Water efficient landscaping techniques may include:(i) Reducing or eliminating the use of potable water for irrigation; and(ii) Configuring irrigation and sprinkler systems to avoid spraying water directly on buildings, sidewalks, or other hardscapes.(2) This section does not apply to athletic fields or other project elements that are eligible for exclusion from water efficient landscaping standards under either the United States green building council rating system, international green construction code, other nationally recognized consensus standard, or the Washington sustainable school design protocol, as each standard existed on June 11, 2020.(3)(a) Nothing in this section may prohibit or restrict the use of wildfire ignition resistant landscaping, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire buffer in the building ignition zone, in the design and construction of major facility projects subject to the requirements of RCW 39.35D.030 or 39.35D.040.(b) The definitions in this subsection (3)(b) apply throughout this subsection unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(i) \"Building ignition zone\" means a building and surrounding area up to two hundred feet from the foundation.(ii) \"Firewise\" means the firewise communities program developed by the national fire protection association, which encourages local solutions for wildfire safety by involving homeowners, community leaders, planners, developers, firefighters, and others in the effort to protect people and property from wildfire risks.(iii) \"Wildfire ignition resistant landscaping\" includes:(A) Any landscaping tools or techniques, or noninvasive vegetation, that do not readily ignite from a flame or other ignition source; or(B) The use of firewise methods to reduce ignition risk in a building ignition zone.\n\n(1)(a) The legislature intends to encourage the use of landscaping design techniques that meet the highest standards for water efficiency in the design and construction of state-funded buildings.
