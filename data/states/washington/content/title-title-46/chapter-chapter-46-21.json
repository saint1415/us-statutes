The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.(3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.ARTICLE VI—Applicability of Other LawsExcept as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a non-party state.ARTICLE VII—Compact Administrator andInterchange of Information(a) The head of the licensing authority of each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for his state.
