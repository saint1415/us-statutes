Any local authority which adopts that body of rules by reference may at any time exclude any section or sections of those rules that it does not desire to include in its local traffic ordinance. The rules are not intended to deny any local authority its legislative power, but rather to enhance safe and efficient movement of traffic throughout the state by having current, uniform traffic laws available.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to encourage highway safety and uniform traffic laws by authorizing the department of licensing to adopt a comprehensive compilation of sound, uniform traffic laws to serve as a guide which local authorities may adopt by reference or any part thereof, including all future amendments or additions thereto.
