Consequently, the safety, reliability, and stability of privately operated limousine transportation services are matters of statewide importance. The regulation of privately operated limousine transportation services is thus an essential governmental function. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to permit the department and a port district in a county with a population of one million or more to regulate limousine transportation services without liability under federal antitrust laws. It is further the intent of the legislature to authorize a city with a population of five hundred thousand or more to enforce this chapter through a joint agreement with the department, and to direct the department to provide annual funding from limousine regulation-related fees that provide sufficient funds to such a city to provide delegated enforcement.\n\nThe legislature finds and declares that privately operated limousine transportation service is a vital part of the transportation system within the state and provides prearranged transportation services to state residents, tourists, and out-of-state business people.
