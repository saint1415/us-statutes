The transportation funding program is intended to satisfy the following state policies and objectives:(a) Statewide system: Provide for preservation of the existing statewide system and improvements for current and expected capacity needs in rural, established urban, and growing suburban areas throughout the state;(b) Local flexibility: Provide for necessary state highway improvements, as well as providing local governments with the option to use new funding sources for projects meeting local and regional needs;(c) Multimodal: Provide a source of funds that may be used for multimodal transportation purposes;(d) Program compatibility: Implement transportation facilities and services that are consistent with adopted land use and transportation plans and coordinated with recently authorized programs such as the act authorizing creation of transportation benefit districts and the local transportation act of 1988;(e) Interjurisdictional cooperation: Encourage transportation planning and projects that are multijurisdictional in their conception, development, and benefit, recognizing that mobility problems do not respect jurisdictional boundaries;(f) Public and private sector: Use a state, local, and private sector partnership that equitably shares the burden of meeting transportation needs.(2) The legislature further recognizes that the revenues currently available to the state and to counties, cities, and transit authorities for highway, road, and street construction and preservation fall far short of the identified need. The 1988 Washington road jurisdiction study identified a statewide funding shortfall of between $14.6 and $19.9 billion to bring existing roads to acceptable standards. The gap between identified transportation needs and available revenues continues to increase. A comprehensive transportation funding program is required to meet the current and anticipated future needs of this state.(3) The legislature further recognizes the desirability of making certain changes in the collection and distribution of motor vehicle excise taxes with the following objectives: Simplifying administration and collection of the taxes including adoption of a predictable depreciation schedule for vehicles; simplifying the allocation of the taxes among various recipients; and the dedication of a portion of motor vehicle excise taxes for transportation purposes.(4) The legislature, therefore, declares a need for the three-part funding program embodied in this act: (a) Statewide funding for highways, roads, and streets in urban and rural areas; (b) local option funding authority, available immediately, for the construction and preservation of roads, streets, and transit improvements and facilities; and (c) the creation of a multimodal transportation fund that is funded through dedication of a portion of motor vehicle excise tax.
