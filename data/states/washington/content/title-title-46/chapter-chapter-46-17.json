Vehicle subagents perform vehicle and vessel licensing on behalf of the state; they are small Washington family businesses, not large out-of-state corporations, and therefore the revenue from these businesses stays here and is invested back into their Washington communities. Vehicle subagents are located in most communities of the state and are open extended hours and weekends to serve the public. These private businesses collect and remit hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and fees for the state of Washington each year. The only moneys that are retained by vehicle subagents are the five dollar registration service fee or the twelve dollar titling service fee; all other moneys are remitted to the county and state. With the rising costs of property rents, worker benefits, and employee wages and the future increases to come, subagents will not be able to continue to operate without an adjustment to their fees.(2) Furthermore, the legislature finds that the county auditors, acting as agents of Washington state, provide the service of registering vehicles and vessels to Washington's citizens, and the legislature has allowed the county auditors to charge a filing fee to recoup the costs of providing this service. The filing fee revenue is deposited into the county general fund of the county where the fee is collected and supports all county functions, including law enforcement and public safety. The cost of providing licensing services has gone up, and eleven counties now must receive state general fund assistance since the costs of providing the service is more than the filing fee revenue collected in those counties. The legislature finds that adjusting the filing fee would eliminate the need for the state to provide financial assistance to those eleven counties.(3) The legislature intends to keep the state vehicle and vessel licensing delivery system healthy, and subagents and county auditors are a critical component of that system.
