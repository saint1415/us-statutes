In the case of a bus, auto stage, or a passenger-carrying for hire vehicle with a seating capacity of more than six, the declared gross weight is determined by multiplying 150 pounds by the number of seats in the vehicle, including the driver's seat, and adding this amount to the unladen weight of the vehicle.

It is determined by dividing the in-jurisdiction distance for a particular jurisdiction by the total distance.(17) \"Refuse\" has the same meaning as \"deny\" in subsection (7) of this section.(18) \"Registrant\" means a person, business, or corporation in whose name or names a vehicle or fleet of vehicles is registered.(19) \"Registration year\" means the 12-month period during which the credentials issued by the base jurisdiction are valid.(20) \"Reporting period\" means the period of 12 consecutive months immediately prior to July 1st of the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the registration year for which apportioned registration is sought.
