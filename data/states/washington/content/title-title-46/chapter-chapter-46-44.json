The maximum load on any axle in any group of axles shall not exceed the single axle or tandem axle allowance as set forth in the table above.The maximum axle and gross weights specified in this section are subject to the braking requirements set up for the service brakes upon any motor vehicle or combination of vehicles as provided by law.Loads of not more than eighty thousand pounds which may be legally hauled in the state bordering this state which also has a sales tax, are legal in this state when moving to a port district within four miles of the bordering state except on the interstate system. This provision does not allow the operation of a vehicle combination consisting of a truck tractor and three trailers.Notwithstanding anything contained herein, a vehicle or combination of vehicles in operation on January 4, 1975, may operate upon the public highways of this state, including the interstate system within the meaning of section 127 of Title 23, United States Code, with an overall gross weight upon a group of two consecutive sets of dual axles which was lawful in this state under the laws, regulations, and procedures in effect in this state on January 4, 1975.\n\nNo vehicle or combination of vehicles shall operate upon the public highways of this state with a gross load on any single axle in excess of twenty thousand pounds, or upon any group of axles in excess of that set forth in the following table, except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand pounds each, if the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six feet or more.\n\nThe following table is based on the following formula: W = 500((LN/N-1)+12N+36).

An axle manufactured after July 31, 1993, carrying more than ten thousand pounds gross weight must be equipped with four or more tires. An axle carrying more than ten thousand pounds gross weight must have four or more tires, regardless of date of manufacture. Instead of the four or more tires per axle requirements of this section, an axle may be equipped with two tires limited to five hundred pounds per inch width of tire. This section does not apply to vehicles operating under oversize or overweight permits, or both, issued under RCW 46.44.090, while carrying a nonreducible load.The following equipment may operate at six hundred pounds per inch width of tire: (1) A nonliftable steering axle or axles on the power unit; (2) a tiller axle on firefighting apparatus; (3) a rear booster trailing axle equipped with two tires on a ready-mix concrete transit truck; and (4) a straddle trailer manufactured before January 1, 1996, equipped with single-tire axles or a single axle using a walking beam supported by two in-line single tires and used exclusively for the transport of fruit bins between field, storage, and processing. A straddle trailer manufactured after January 1, 1996, meeting this use criteria may carry five hundred fifteen pounds per inch width of tire on sixteen and one-half inch wide tires.For the purpose of this section, the width of tire in case of solid rubber or hollow center cushion tires, so long as the use thereof may be permitted by the law, shall be measured between the flanges of the rim. For the purpose of this section, the width of tires in case of pneumatic tires shall be the maximum overall normal inflated width as stipulated by the manufacturer when inflated to the pressure specified and without load thereon.The department of transportation, by rule with respect to state highways, and a local authority, with respect to a public highway under its jurisdiction, may extend the weight table in RCW 46.44.041 to one hundred fifteen thousand pounds.

These vehicles and associated loads or equipment are necessary to protect the public safety and are considered nondivisible loads. A vehicle or combination of vehicles that is not designed primarily for fire suppression including, but not limited to, a hazardous materials response vehicle, bus, mobile kitchen, mobile sanitation facility, and heavy equipment transport vehicle is not a firefighting apparatus for purposes of this section.(2) Firefighting apparatus must comply with all applicable federal and state vehicle operating and safety criteria, including rules adopted by agencies within each jurisdiction.(3) All owners and operators of firefighting apparatus shall comply with current information, provided by the department, regarding the applicable load restrictions of state and local bridges within the designated fire service area, including any automatic or mutual aid agreement areas.(4) Firefighting apparatus operating within a fire district or municipal department boundary of the owner of the apparatus, including any automatic or mutual aid agreement areas, may operate without a permit if:(a) The weight does not exceed:(i) 600 pounds per inch width of tire;(ii) 24,000 pounds on a single axle;(iii) 43,000 pounds on a tandem axle set;(iv) 67,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, subject to the gross weight limits of RCW 46.44.091(1) (c), (d), and (e);(v) The tire manufacturer's tire load rating.(b) There is no tridem axle set.(c) The dimensions do not exceed:(i) 8 feet, 6 inches wide;(ii) 14 feet high;(iii) 65 feet overall length;(iv) 15 foot front overhang;(v) Rear overhang not exceeding the length of the wheel base.(5) Operators of firefighting apparatus that exceed the weight limits in subsection (4) of this section must apply for an overweight permit with the department. The maximum weight a firefighting apparatus may weigh is 50,000 pounds on the tandem axle set and 31,000 pounds on a single drive axle, and may not exceed 670 pounds per inch width of tire. The maximum weight limit must include the weight of a full water tank, if applicable, all equipment necessary for operation, and the normal number of personnel usually assigned to be on board, or four personnel, whichever is greater. At least four personnel must be physically present at the time the apparatus is weighed.(6) When applying for a permit, a current weight slip from a certified scale must be attached to the department's application form. Upon receiving an application, the department shall transmit it to the local jurisdictions in which the firefighting apparatus will be operating, so that the local jurisdictions can make a determination on the need for local travel and route restrictions within the operating area. The department shall issue a permit within twenty days of receiving a permit application and shall issue the permit on an annual basis for the apparatus to operate on the state highway system, with reference made to applicable load restrictions and any other limitations stipulated on the permit, including limitations placed by local jurisdictions.(7) Firefighting apparatus in operation in this state before June 13, 2002, and privately owned industrial firefighting apparatus used for purposes of providing emergency response and mutual aid are each exempt from subsections (4) and (5) of this section. However, operators of the exempt firefighting apparatus must still obtain an annual permit under subsection (6) of this section.(8) Firefighting apparatus without the proper overweight permits are prohibited from being operated on city, county, or state roadways until the apparatus is within legal weight limits and a current permit has been issued by the department. When the permit is issued, the fire district must notify the Washington state patrol that the apparatus is in compliance with overweight permit regulations.(9) The Washington state patrol may conduct random spot checks of firefighting apparatus to ensure compliance with overweight permit regulations. If a firefighting apparatus is found to be not in compliance with overweight permit regulations, the state patrol shall issue a violation notice to the fire department stating this fact and prohibiting operation of the apparatus on city, county, and state roadways.(10) It is a traffic infraction to continue to operate a firefighting apparatus on the roadways after a violation notice has been issued. The following penalties apply:(a) For a first offense, the penalty will be no less than fifty dollars but no more than fifty dollars;(b) For a second offense, the penalty will be no less than seventy-five dollars;(c) For a third or subsequent offense, the penalty will be no less than one hundred dollars.(11) No individual liability attaches to an employee or volunteer of the penalized fire department.\n\n(1) As used in this section, \"firefighting apparatus\" means a vehicle or combination of vehicles, owned by a regularly organized fire suppression agency, designed, maintained, and used exclusively for fire suppression and rescue or for fire prevention activities.
