Upon making such a determination, the board of directors shall, for purposes of determining whether a subsequent distribution to shareholders is prohibited under *RCW 23B.06.400(2), be entitled to treat such liability as fully satisfied by the assets used or committed in order to make such provision.

The assumption of control over the corporation's assets by a court, an assignee for the benefit of creditors, or a general receiver relieves the directors of any further duties with respect to the liquidation of the corporation's assets or the application of any assets or proceeds toward satisfaction of its liabilities.(5) Corporate actions to be approved by a corporation that has been dissolved under RCW 23B.14.030 or ** 23B.14.210, which are within the scope of activities permitted in this chapter, may be approved by the corporation's board of directors and, if required, by its shareholders, membership in both groups determined as of the effective date of the dissolution.
