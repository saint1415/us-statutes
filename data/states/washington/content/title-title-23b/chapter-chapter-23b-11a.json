and\n\n(iv) The person will not, by reason of such prior owner liability, have owner liability with respect to any owner liabilities that arise after the merger or share exchange becomes effective;\n\n(c) If a person has owner liability both before and after a merger becomes effective with unchanged terms and conditions with respect to the entity that is the surviving entity by reason of owning the same shares or interests before and after the merger becomes effective, the merger has no effect on such owner liability; and\n\n(d) A share exchange has no effect on owner liability related to shares of the acquired entity that were not exchanged in the share exchange.\n\n(4) Upon a merger becoming effective, a foreign other entity that is the surviving entity of the merger is deemed to:\n\n(a) Appoint the secretary of state as its agent for service of process in a proceeding to enforce the rights of shareholders of each domestic corporation that is a party to the merger who are entitled to and exercise dissenters' rights under chapter 23B.13 RCW; and\n\n(b) Agree that it will promptly pay the amount, if any, to which such shareholders are entitled under chapter 23B.13 RCW.\n\n(5) Except as provided in the organic law governing a party to a merger or in its articles of incorporation or organic rules, the merger does not give rise to any rights that a shareholder, interest holder, governor, or third party would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of that party.
