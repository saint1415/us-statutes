A shareholder record date shall be determined pursuant to the comparable provision to RCW 23B.07.070 of the law of the state in which a foreign corporation is incorporated. If a shareholder record date has not been fixed by the board of directors within the preceding four months, the determination shall be made as of the end of the corporation's most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nThe residence of each shareholder is presumed to be the address appearing in the records of the corporation. Shares held of record by brokers or nominees shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the percentages and numbers specified in this subsection. Shares of a corporation allocated to the account of an employee or former employee or beneficiaries of employees or former employees of a corporation and held in a plan that is qualified under section 401(a) of the federal internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and is a defined contribution plan within the meaning of section 414(i) of the code shall be deemed, for the purposes of this subsection, to be held of record by the employee to whose account such shares are allocated.\n\nA domestic or foreign corporation shall be deemed to be a target corporation if the domestic or foreign corporation's failure to satisfy the requirements of this subsection is caused by the action of, or is the result of a proposal by, an acquiring person or affiliate or associate of an acquiring person.\n\n(20) \"Voting power\" means the total number of votes entitled to be cast by all of the outstanding voting shares of a corporation.\n\n(21) \"Voting shares\" means shares of all classes of a corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\n\n[ 2017 c 28 s 18; 2016 c 216 s 1; 2015 c 176 s 2147; 1996 c 155 s 1; 1989 c 165 s 198.]\n\nEffective date—Contingent effective date—2015 c 176: See note following RCW 23.95.100.\n\nEffective date—Contingent effective date—2015 c 176: See note following RCW 23.95.100.",
