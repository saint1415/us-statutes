They also recognize that careful planning, experimentation, and testing are needed before appropriate short-haul air transportation can be developed for all the situations in which it would be beneficial to the economy and general welfare of the western states. To meet this need, the party states agree that a regional compact should be established for the purpose of organizing and conducting a series of demonstration programs to test the feasibility of new short-haul air transportation concepts in the West.Article IIREGIONAL COMMISSIONA.
