This act makes technical, nonsubstantive amendments as follows:(1) Section 2 of this act amends RCW 1.20.051 to conform the start and end dates of daylight saving time to the dates in federal law, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 260a.(2) Section 3 of this act is intended to correct an apparent error in RCW 6.23.120. The legislature apparently intended to refer to one hundred twenty percent of the redemption amount, rather than one hundred twenty percent greater than the redemption amount. P.H.T.S., LLC v. Vantage Capital, LLC, 186 Wn. App. 281, 289 n.8, 345 P.3d 20, 24 (2015).(3) Section 4 of this act is intended to correct an apparent error in RCW 6.27.060. The section contains a cross-reference to the fee schedule in RCW 36.18.020, when the actual fee is found in RCW 36.18.016(6).(4) Section 5 of this act amends RCW 9A.56.130 to reflect multiple changes in subsection numbering of a cross-referenced section.(5) Section 6 of this act is intended to correct an apparent error in RCW 11.02.005(10). One sentence in the subsection is repeated in nearly identical form in the same subsection.(6) Section 7 of this act amends RCW 13.40.193 to reflect a change in subsection numbering of a cross-referenced section.(7) Section 8 of this act is intended to correct an apparent error in RCW 15.24.100. Section 8, chapter 15, Laws of 2016 sp. sess. removed the language authorizing an assessment in RCW 15.24.100. The assessment referred to appears to be the assessment authorized in RCW 15.24.090.(8) Section 9 of this act clarifies language in RCW 26.50.070(4) by consistently using the term \"ex parte temporary order\" throughout the subsection.(9) Section 10 of this act merges a double amendment created when section 39, chapter 7, Laws of 2010 1st sp. sess. amended RCW 43.21B.005 without reference to the amendments made by section 4, chapter 210, Laws of 2010.(10) Section 11 of this act is intended to correct an apparent error in RCW 43.43.823(5).
