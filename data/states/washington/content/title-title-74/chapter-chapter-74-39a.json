There is a growing demand for improvement and expansion of home and community-based long-term care services to support and complement the services provided by these informal caregivers.The legislature further finds that the public interest would best be served by a broad array of long-term care services that support persons who need such services at home or in the community whenever practicable and that promote individual autonomy, dignity, and choice.The legislature finds that as other long-term care options become more available, the relative need for nursing home beds is likely to decline. The legislature recognizes, however, that nursing home care will continue to be a critical part of the state's long-term care options, and that such services should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a homelike environment.The legislature finds that many recipients of in-home services are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care.

The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations, and room and board.(2) Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs.(a) The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool.

Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation.

The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.(3) The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:(a) Supplies;(b) Nonlabor administrative expenses;(c) Staff education and in-service training; and(d) Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and occupational [occupation] taxes.(4) The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.(5) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services.

In order to maintain and grow the current level of cost-effective options for long-term care, it is critical to update state policies including provider payment rates to ensure the availability of enrolled providers is sufficient to serve the number of beneficiaries who wish to remain within geographic proximity to their home community.\n\n(2) The legislature intends to replace the outdated payment system with a new methodology that is:\n\n(a) Transparent and understandable to the providers and the public;\n\n(b) Aligns payments to client acuity and contractual requirements; and\n\n(c) Is supported by relevant, verifiable, and independent data to the extent possible.\" [ 2018 c 225 s 1.]",

In addition, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine an administrative rate for the consumer directed employer.\n\nIn addition, the rate-setting board may take testimony and make a recommendation regarding the administrative vendor rate for home care agencies that serve medicaid clients.\n\n(5) The department shall provide administrative support for the board.\n\n(a) At the commencement of the board's rate-setting activities, the voting members must first attempt to select an additional voting member, who will chair the rate-setting board and will cast a tie-breaking vote if the voting members identified in subsection (2) of this section are unable to pass by majority vote on the labor rate.\n\n(b) On the first occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a tie-breaking member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected as follows:\n\n(i) The voting member representing the governor's office shall request a list of five qualified arbitrators, or six if there are two consumer directed employers, from the federal mediation and conciliation service.\n\n(ii) If a majority of the voting members of the board cannot agree on the selection of a neutral arbitrator from the list, the representative from the consumer directed employer who first contacted the department will strike a name from the list first. The representative from the governor's office shall then strike a name from the list, the designee from the exclusive bargaining representative or, in the absence of an exclusive bargaining representative, the designee from the consumer directed employer workforce shall strike a name from the list, if there are two consumer directed employers, the second representative will strike a name from the list, and finally the representative from the department shall strike a name from the list.\n\n(iii) The name of the arbitrator remaining after the final strike shall be the chair member of the board.\n\n(iv) If that person is not willing or available to be the chair member, the second to last person remaining on the list shall be asked to be the chair member. If the second to last person is not willing or available, the third to last person shall be asked to be the chair member. This process of selecting an arbitrator shall be continued until a chair member of the board is appointed.\n\n(c) On the next occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected using the method described in (b) of this subsection except that the order of board members striking names from the list, described in (b)(ii) of this subsection, shall be reversed.\n\n(d) On each successive occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the order of voting members striking names from the list will continue to alternate between the order described in (b)(ii) and (c) of this subsection.\n\n(6) If an agreement on a proposed labor rate, an administrative rate, or both, is not reached by a majority of the voting members of the rate-setting board prior to July 1st, then:\n\n(a) The labor rate shall be determined by the vote of the chair member, who was selected in accordance with subsections (2) and (5)(a) of this section; and\n\n(b) The administrative rate shall be determined by the department.\n\n(7) After the rates have been determined in accordance with subsections (3) through (6) of this section, they shall be submitted to the director of the office of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session during which the requests are to be considered for review. If the director of the office of financial management certifies them as being feasible financially for the state, the governor shall include a request for funds necessary to implement the proposed rates as part of the governor's budget document submitted under RCW 43.88.030 and 43.88.060. The legislature shall approve or reject the request for funds as a whole.\n\n(8) If the legislature rejects the request under subsection (6) of this section, the matter shall return to the rate-setting board established under this section for further consideration. Until the legislature approves a request for funds under this section, the current labor rate shall stay in effect.\n\n(9) The labor rate approved by the legislature shall be an hourly rate paid to the consumer directed employer. The labor rate shall be used exclusively for paying the wages, associated taxes, and benefits of individual providers. The consumer directed employer shall have full discretion to set wages and benefits for individual providers, except as provided in: (a) Subsection (10) of this section; (b) any specific legislative appropriation requirement; or (c) a collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.\n\n(10) The labor rate shall include a specific hourly amount that the consumer directed employer may use only for health benefits for individual providers.\n\n(11) The department shall make a one-time transfer of funds totaling the full amount of previously unclaimed paid time off to the consumer directed employer, and shall transfer all associated liabilities for payment of unclaimed paid time off to the consumer directed employer. This amount shall be accounted for as a labor rate payment.\n\n(12) The department shall have the authority to modify the labor rate and the administrative rate between the rate-setting board's rate-setting activities without convening the rate-setting board or following the preceding rate-setting process, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(a) The department finds the changes to the rates necessary to:\n\n(i) Recognize changes to the department's required expenditures or the consumer directed employer's required costs associated with changes to tax rates, required employer contributions, mileage rate allowances, and utilization of overtime to comply with RCW 74.39A.525; or\n\n(ii) Comply with a significant change in state or federal rule or law that would impact the consumer directed employer's ability to operate;\n\n(b) Changes to the rates shall not exceed two percent of the combined labor and administrative rates; and\n\n(c) Any increase to the rates is contingent on appropriation of adequate funds by the legislature.\n\n(13) For the purpose of this section:\n\n(a) \"Labor rate\" is defined as that portion of the consumer directed employer's hourly rate that is to be used by the consumer directed employer to compensate its workers, including wages, benefits, and any associated taxes.\n\n(b) \"Administrative rate\" is defined as that portion of the consumer directed employer's hourly rate that is to be used by the consumer directed employer to perform its administrative duties including losses for bad debt, compensation for business and occupation taxes on the labor and administrative rates, and all other costs associated with operating as the consumer directed employer.\n\n[ 2021 c 186 s 2; 2018 c 278 s 27.]\n\n*Reviser's note: This RCW reference has been corrected to reflect the reorganization of chapter 41.56 RCW by 2025 c 290 s 2.\n\n*Reviser's note: This RCW reference has been corrected to reflect the reorganization of chapter 41.56 RCW by 2025 c 290 s 2.\n\nFindings—Intent—2018 c 278: See note following RCW 74.39A.500.\n\nFindings—Intent—2018 c 278: See note following RCW 74.39A.500.",
