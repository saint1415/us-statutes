Those restrictions may impair the agricultural producer's ability to compete in local, domestic, and foreign markets;(3) That it is in the overriding public interest that support for the wheat and barley industries be clearly expressed, that adequate protection be given to the industries and their activities and operations, and that wheat and barley be promoted individually and as part of a comprehensive agricultural industry to:(a) Enhance the reputation and image of Washington state's wheat and barley;(b) Increase the sale and use of Washington state's wheat and barley in local, domestic, and foreign markets;(c) Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of Washington state's wheat and barley;(d) Increase the knowledge of the health-giving qualities and dietetic value of Washington state's wheat and barley and wheat and barley products;(e) Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the planting, production, harvesting, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of wheat and barley produced in Washington state;(4) That the commission is established primarily for the benefit of the people of the state of Washington and its economy.
