The surety bond shall be maintained at not less than the required sum at all times during the licensed period.

The director shall be notified ten days before any reduction of insurance coverage at the request of the applicant or cancellation of the surety bond or insurance by the surety or insurer and by the insured.(4) The total and aggregate of the surety and insurer for all claims is limited to the face of the surety bond or insurance policy. The director may accept a surety bond or insurance policy in the proper sum that has a deductible clause in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars for the total amount of surety bond or insurance required by this section. If the applicant has not satisfied the requirement of the deductible amount in any prior legal claim the deductible clause may not be accepted by the director unless the applicant furnishes the director with a surety bond or insurance policy which satisfies the amount of the deductible as to all claims that may arise.\n\n(1) The following requirements apply to the forms of evidence of financial responsibility required under RCW 15.58.460.\n\n(a) Errors and Omissions Insurance. The amount of the errors and omissions insurance policy required by RCW 15.58.460(2)(a) shall not be less than twenty-five thousand dollars. The insurance policy shall be maintained at not less than the required sum at all times during the licensed period. The insurance policy shall provide coverage for errors and omissions in an inspection conducted during the term of the policy. However, the policy may limit the insurer's liability on the policy in effect at the time of the inspection to two years from the date of the inspection.\n\n(b) Surety Bond. The amount of the surety bond required by RCW 15.58.460(2)(b) shall not be less than twenty-five thousand dollars.

The surety issuing the bond shall be named as a party to any suit upon the bond. The suit upon the bond must be commenced within two years of the date of the inspection.\n\n(c) Surety Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance. The amount of the surety bond required by RCW 15.58.460(2)(c) shall not be less than twelve thousand five hundred dollars. Except as to the amount of the bond, the terms of the bond shall be identical to those set forth in (b) of this subsection.

In such a case the director shall not cancel the assigned account agreement until the director either receives a copy of the order dismissing the action by registered or certified mail, or has received a copy of the unsatisfied judgment and has complied with the requirements of (d)(ii) of this subsection.\n\n(ii) Any person having an unsatisfied final judgment against the inspector for legal damages awarded based on errors and omissions in the conduct of an inspection may execute upon the funds in the assigned account by serving a certified copy of the unsatisfied final judgment by registered or certified mail upon the department within one year of the date of entry of such judgment. Upon the receipt of service of such certified copy the department shall direct the financial institution to pay from the assigned account, through the registry of the court which rendered judgment, towards the amount of the unsatisfied judgment.
