Applicants for a certificate must also meet all other statutory licensing requirements.Certificates of restoration of opportunity offer potential public and private employers or housing providers concrete and objective information about an individual under consideration for an opportunity. These certificates can facilitate the successful societal reintegration of individuals with a criminal history whose behavior demonstrates that they are taking responsibility for their past criminal conduct and pursuing a positive law-abiding future. A certificate of restoration of opportunity provides a process for people previously sentenced by a Washington court who have successfully changed their lives to seek a court document confirming their changed circumstances.A certificate of restoration of opportunity does not affect any employer's or housing provider's discretion to individually assess every applicant and to hire or rent to the applicants of their choice. Employers will not have to forego hiring their chosen applicants because they face statutory bars that prevent obtaining the necessary occupational credentials.\" [ 2016 c 81 s 1.]\n\nFinding—2016 c 81: \"The legislature finds that employment is a key factor to the successful reintegration to society of people with criminal histories, and is critical to reducing recidivism, promoting public safety, and encouraging personal responsibility.\n\nOccupational licensing and employment laws regulate many professions as well as unskilled and semiskilled occupations. Examples of regulated occupations include alcohol servers, barbers and cosmetologists, body piercers, commercial fishers, contractors, drivers, embalmers, engineers, health care workers, insurance adjusters, real estate professionals, tattoo artists, and waste management workers. Individuals with criminal histories may meet the competency requirements for these occupations through training, experience, or education, but may be disqualified from them based on their criminal history.\n\nCertificates of restoration of opportunity help reduce some barriers to employment for adults and juveniles by providing an opportunity for individuals to become more employable and to more successfully reintegrate into society after they have served their sentence, demonstrated a period of law-abiding behavior consistent with successful reentry, and have turned their lives around following a conviction.
