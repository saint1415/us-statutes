Votes must be individually tallied for a candidate who has filed as a write-in candidate for the office in the manner provided by RCW 29A.24.311 as long as the requirements of subsection (6), (7), or (8) of this section are met. No write-in vote for a declared write-in candidate may be rejected due to variation in the form of the name if the canvassing board can determine the person and office for which the voter intended to vote.(2) The total number of write-in votes cast for each office must be recorded and reported with the canvass for the election.(3) A write-in vote for an individual candidate for an office whose name is printed on the ballot for that same office is a valid vote for that candidate as long as the candidate's name is clearly discernible, even if the voter also marked a vote for that candidate such as to otherwise register an overvote.(4) Write-in votes cast for an individual candidate for an office whose name does not appear on the ballot need not be individually tallied unless the candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy.(5) In the case of write-in candidates for a statewide office or any office whose jurisdiction encompasses more than one county, write-in votes for an individual candidate must be tallied when the county auditor is notified by the filing officer for that office that a candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy. In all other cases, the county auditor determines, in accordance with this section, whether a candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy and thus, write-in votes must be individually tallied. The county canvassing board must certify write-in votes including the vote total received by a candidate that has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy if the requirements of subsection (6), (7), or (8) of this section are met. Final results must consolidate the vote total associated with each candidate after the canvassing board has reconciled any variation in the spelling of names for those candidates.(6) In a primary, if the name of only a single candidate appears on the ballot for an office, and the total number of write-in votes cast for that office exceeds one percent of the total number of votes cast for that office, the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported. Otherwise, individual tallying of write-in votes is not required.(7) In a primary, if two or more candidates appear on the ballot for an office and the total number of write-in votes cast for that office exceeds the number of votes cast for the candidate with the second highest number of votes, then the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported. Otherwise, individual tallying of write-in votes is not required.(8) In a general election, if the total number of write-in votes cast for an office exceeds the number of votes cast for the candidate apparently elected to that office, then the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported.

This audit must be conducted by randomly selecting by lot up to four percent of the direct recording electronic voting devices or other in-person ballot marking systems, or one direct recording electronic voting device or other in-person ballot marking system, whichever is greater, and, for each device or system, comparing the results recorded electronically with the results recorded on paper. For purposes of this audit, the results recorded on paper must be tabulated as follows: On one-fourth of the devices or systems selected for audit, the paper records must be tabulated manually; on the remaining devices or systems, the paper records may be tabulated by a mechanical device determined by the secretary of state to be capable of accurately reading the votes cast and printed thereon and qualified for use in the state under applicable state and federal laws.

A \"risk limit\" means the largest statistical probability that an incorrect reported tabulation outcome is not detected in a risk-limiting audit;(ii) Randomly select for audit at least one statewide contest, and for each county at least one ballot contest other than the selected statewide contest.
