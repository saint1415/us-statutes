The department may not require an employer to submit a request in order for these benefits to not be charged.(a) Benefits paid to any individual later determined to be ineligible for those benefits or disqualified to receive those benefits shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer, except:(i) As provided in subsection (4) of this section; or(ii) As provided in subsection (5) of this section.(b) Benefits paid to an individual filing under the provisions of chapter 50.06 RCW shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer only if:(i) The individual files under RCW 50.06.020(1) after receiving crime victims' compensation for a disability resulting from a nonwork-related occurrence; or(ii) The individual files under RCW 50.06.020(2).(c) Benefits paid which represent the state's share of benefits payable as extended benefits defined under RCW 50.22.010(6) shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(d) In the case of individuals who requalify for benefits under RCW 50.20.050 or 50.20.060, benefits based on wage credits earned prior to the disqualifying separation shall not be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer from whom that separation took place.(e) If the department determines an individual left the employ of the separating employer under the circumstances described in RCW 50.20.050(1)(b) (iv) or (xi), (2)(b)(ii), only for separation that was necessary because the care for a child or a vulnerable adult in the claimant's care is inaccessible, (iv), (xi), (xii), or (xiii), or (3), as applicable, benefits paid to that individual shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any base year contribution paying employer.(f) Upon approval of an individual's training benefits plan submitted in accordance with RCW 50.22.155(2), an individual is considered enrolled in training, and regular benefits beginning with the week of approval shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(g) Training benefits paid to an individual under RCW 50.22.155 shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(h)(i) Benefits paid during the one week waiting period when the one week waiting period is fully paid or fully reimbursed by the federal government shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(ii) In the event the one week waiting period is partially paid or partially reimbursed by the federal government, the department may, by rule, elect to not charge, in full or in part, benefits paid during the one week waiting period to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(i) Benefits paid for all weeks starting with the week ending March 28, 2020, and ending with the week ending May 30, 2020, shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.(3)(a) A contribution paying base year employer, except employers as provided in subsection (5) of this section, not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section, may receive such relief if the benefit charges result from payment to an individual who:(i) Last left the employ of such employer voluntarily for reasons not attributable to the employer. In addition to other circumstances identified by the department by rule, an individual who leaves the employ of such employer under the circumstances described in RCW 50.20.050(1)(b) (iv) or (xi), (2)(b) (iv), (xi), or (xii), or (3) must be deemed to have left their employ for reasons not attributable to the employer;(ii) Was discharged for misconduct or gross misconduct connected with his or her work not a result of inability to meet the minimum job requirements;(iii) Is unemployed as a result of closure or severe curtailment of operation at the employer's plant, building, worksite, or other facility.

The department may waive this time limitation for good cause. The commissioner, upon investigation of the request, shall determine whether relief should be granted.(4) When a benefit claim becomes invalid due to an amendment or adjustment of a report where the employer failed to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, all benefits paid will be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer or employers that originally filed the incomplete or inaccurate report or reports. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and who fails to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on the originally filed incomplete or inaccurate report or reports.(5) An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.(a) For the purposes of this subsection, \"adequately\" means providing accurate information of sufficient quantity and quality that would allow a reasonable person to determine whether an individual is eligible for or qualified to receive benefits.(b)(i) For the purposes of this subsection, \"pattern\" means a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to a claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure, if the greater of the following calculations for an employer is met:(A) At least three times in the previous two years; or(B) Twenty percent of the total current claims against the employer.(ii) If an employer's agent is utilized, a pattern is established based on each individual client employer that the employer's agent represents.\n\n(1)(a) An experience rating account shall be established and maintained for each employer, except employers as described in RCW 50.44.010, 50.44.030, and 50.50.030 who have properly elected to make payments in lieu of contributions, taxable local government employers as described in RCW 50.44.035, and those employers who are required to make payments in lieu of contributions, based on existing records of the employment security department.\n\n(b) Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged to the experience rating accounts of each of such individual's employers during the individual's base year in the same ratio that the wages paid by each employer to the individual during the base year bear to the wages paid by all employers to that individual during that base year, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n\n(c) When the eligible individual's separating employer is a covered contribution paying base year employer, benefits paid to the eligible individual shall be charged to the experience rating account of only the individual's separating employer if:\n\n(i) The individual qualifies for benefits under RCW 50.20.050 (1)(b)(i) or (2)(b)(i), as applicable, and became unemployed after having worked and earned wages in the bona fide work;\n\n(ii) The individual qualifies for benefits under RCW 50.20.050 (1)(b) (v) through (x) or (2)(b) (v) through (x); or\n\n(iii) During a public health emergency, the claimant worked at a health care facility as defined in RCW 9A.50.010, was directly involved in the delivery of health services, and was terminated from work due to entering quarantine because of exposure to or contracting the disease that is the subject of the declaration of the public health emergency.\n\n(2) The legislature finds that certain benefit payments, in whole or in part, should not be charged to the experience rating accounts of employers except those employers described in RCW 50.44.010, 50.44.030, and 50.50.030 who have properly elected to make payments in lieu of contributions, taxable local government employers described in RCW 50.44.035, and those employers who are required to make payments in lieu of contributions, as follows in (a) through (i) of this subsection.

The department may not require an employer to submit a request in order for these benefits to not be charged.\n\n(a) Benefits paid to any individual later determined to be ineligible for those benefits or disqualified to receive those benefits shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer, except:\n\n(i) As provided in subsection (4) of this section; or\n\n(ii) As provided in subsection (5) of this section.\n\n(b) Benefits paid to an individual filing under the provisions of chapter 50.06 RCW shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer only if:\n\n(i) The individual files under RCW 50.06.020(1) after receiving crime victims' compensation for a disability resulting from a nonwork-related occurrence; or\n\n(ii) The individual files under RCW 50.06.020(2).\n\n(c) Benefits paid which represent the state's share of benefits payable as extended benefits defined under RCW 50.22.010(6) shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(d) In the case of individuals who requalify for benefits under RCW 50.20.050 or 50.20.060, benefits based on wage credits earned prior to the disqualifying separation shall not be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer from whom that separation took place.\n\n(e) If the department determines an individual left the employ of the separating employer under the circumstances described in RCW 50.20.050(1)(b) (iv) or (xi), (2)(b)(ii), only for separation that was necessary because the care for a child or a vulnerable adult in the claimant's care is inaccessible, (iv), (xi), (xii), or (xiii), or (3), as applicable, benefits paid to that individual shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any base year contribution paying employer.\n\n(f) Upon approval of an individual's training benefits plan submitted in accordance with RCW 50.22.155(2), an individual is considered enrolled in training, and regular benefits beginning with the week of approval shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(g) Training benefits paid to an individual under RCW 50.22.155 shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(h)(i) Benefits paid during the one week waiting period when the one week waiting period is fully paid or fully reimbursed by the federal government shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(ii) In the event the one week waiting period is partially paid or partially reimbursed by the federal government, the department may, by rule, elect to not charge, in full or in part, benefits paid during the one week waiting period to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(i) Benefits paid for all weeks starting with the week ending March 28, 2020, and ending with the week ending May 30, 2020, shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.\n\n(3)(a) A contribution paying base year employer, except employers as provided in subsection (5) of this section, not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section, may receive such relief if the benefit charges result from payment to an individual who:\n\n(i) Last left the employ of such employer voluntarily for reasons not attributable to the employer. In addition to other circumstances identified by the department by rule, an individual who leaves the employ of such employer under the circumstances described in RCW 50.20.050(1)(b) (iv) or (xi), (2)(b) (iv), (xi), or (xii), or (3) must be deemed to have left their employ for reasons not attributable to the employer;\n\n(ii) Was discharged for misconduct or gross misconduct connected with his or her work not a result of inability to meet the minimum job requirements;\n\n(iii) Is unemployed as a result of closure or severe curtailment of operation at the employer's plant, building, worksite, or other facility. This closure must be for reasons directly attributable to a catastrophic occurrence such as fire, flood, or other natural disaster, or to the presence of any dangerous, contagious, or infectious disease that is the subject of a public health emergency at the employer's plant, building, worksite, or other facility;\n\n(iv) Continues to be employed by the employer seeking relief and: (A) The employer furnished part-time work to the individual during the base year; (B) the individual has become eligible for benefits because of loss of employment with one or more other employers; and (C) the employer has continued to furnish or make available part-time work to the individual in substantially the same amount as during the individual's base year. This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;\n\n(v) Was hired to replace an employee who is a member of the military reserves or National Guard and was called to federal active military service by the president of the United States and is subsequently laid off when that employee is reemployed by their employer upon release from active duty within the time provided for reemployment in RCW 73.16.035;\n\n(vi) Worked for an employer for 20 weeks or less, and was laid off at the end of temporary employment when that employee temporarily replaced a permanent employee receiving family or medical leave benefits under Title 50A RCW, and the layoff is due to the return of that permanent employee. This subsection (3)(a)(vi) applies to claims with an effective date on or after January 1, 2020; or\n\n(vii) Was discharged because the individual was unable to satisfy a job prerequisite required by law or administrative rule.\n\n(b) The employer requesting relief of charges under this subsection must request relief in writing within 30 days following mailing to the last known address of the notification of the valid initial determination of such claim, stating the date and reason for the separation or the circumstances of continued employment. The department may waive this time limitation for good cause. The commissioner, upon investigation of the request, shall determine whether relief should be granted.\n\n(4) When a benefit claim becomes invalid due to an amendment or adjustment of a report where the employer failed to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, all benefits paid will be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer or employers that originally filed the incomplete or inaccurate report or reports. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and who fails to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on the originally filed incomplete or inaccurate report or reports.\n\n(5) An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.\n\n(a) For the purposes of this subsection, \"adequately\" means providing accurate information of sufficient quantity and quality that would allow a reasonable person to determine whether an individual is eligible for or qualified to receive benefits.\n\n(b)(i) For the purposes of this subsection, \"pattern\" means a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to a claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure, if the greater of the following calculations for an employer is met:\n\n(A) At least three times in the previous two years; or\n\n(B) Twenty percent of the total current claims against the employer.\n\n(ii) If an employer's agent is utilized, a pattern is established based on each individual client employer that the employer's agent represents.\n\n[ 2024 c 51 s 1.

The division shall be carried to the second decimal place with the remaining fraction disregarded unless it amounts to five hundredths or more, in which case the second decimal place shall be rounded to the next higher digit. The flat social cost factor shall be expressed as a percentage.(B)(I) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide more than ten months of unemployment benefits, the commissioner shall calculate the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date by reducing the total social cost by the dollar amount that represents the number of months for which the balance in the unemployment compensation fund on the cut-off date will provide benefits above ten months and dividing the result by the total taxable payroll. However, the calculation under this subsection (1)(b)(i)(B) for a rate year may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than four-tenths lower than the calculation under (b)(i)(A) of this subsection for that rate year. For rate year 2011 and thereafter, the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent except for rate year 2021 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2022 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2023 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than seven-tenths percent, for rate year 2024 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than eighty-five one-hundredths percent, and for rate year 2025 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than nine-tenths percent.(II) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide ten months of unemployment benefits or less, the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date may not increase by more than fifty percent over the previous rate year or may not exceed one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent, whichever is greater.(III) For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), the commissioner shall determine the number of months of unemployment benefits in the unemployment compensation fund using the benefit cost rate for the average of the three highest calendar benefit cost rates in the twenty consecutive completed calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date or a period of consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date that includes three recessions, if longer.(C) The minimum flat social cost factor calculated under this subsection (1)(b) shall be six-tenths of one percent, except that if the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide:(I) At least ten months but less than eleven months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be five-tenths of one percent;

If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor.(b) If the successor is not an employer at the time of the transfer, the following applies:(i) Except as provided in (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection (2), the successor shall pay contributions:(A) At the contribution rate assigned to the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor.(B) Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's contribution rate for each rate year shall be based on an array calculation factor rate that is a combination of the following: The successor's experience with payrolls and benefits; and any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer. If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor if qualified under RCW 50.29.010 by including the transferred experience. If not qualified under RCW 50.29.010, the contribution rate shall equal the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025(1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable, and continuing until the successor qualifies for a different rate, including the transferred experience.(ii) If there is a substantial continuity of ownership, control, or management by the successor of the business of the predecessor, the successor shall pay contributions at the contribution rate determined for the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor. Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's array calculation factor rate shall be based on a combination of the transferred experience of the acquired business and the successor's experience after the transfer.(iii) If the successor simultaneously acquires the business or a portion of the business of two or more employers with different contribution rates, the successor's rate, from the date the transfer occurred until the end of that rate year and until it qualifies in its own right for a new rate, shall be the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025(1) (a) and (b) and 50.29.041, applicable at the time of the acquisition, to the predecessor employer who, among the parties to the acquisition, had the largest total payroll in the completed calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of transfer, but not less than the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025(1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable.(c) With respect to predecessor employers:(i) The contribution rate on any payroll retained by a predecessor employer shall remain unchanged for the remainder of the rate year in which the transfer occurs.(ii) In all cases, beginning January 1st following the transfer, the predecessor's contribution rate or the predecessor's array calculation factor for each rate year shall be based on its experience with payrolls and benefits as of the regular computation date for that rate year excluding the experience of the transferred business or transferred portion of business as that experience has transferred to the successor: PROVIDED, That if all of the predecessor's business is transferred to a successor or successors, the predecessor shall not be a qualified employer until it satisfies the requirements of a \"qualified employer\" as set forth in RCW 50.29.010.(3) A predecessor-successor relationship does not exist for purposes of subsection (2) of this section when a significant purpose of the transfer of a business or its operating assets is for the employer to move or expand an existing business, or for an employer to establish a substantially similar business under common ownership, management, and control. However, if an employer transfers its business to another employer, and both employers are at the time of transfer under substantially common ownership, management, or control, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to, and combined with the unemployment experience attributable to, the employer to whom such business is so transferred as specified in subsection (2)(a) of this section.(4) For purposes of this section, \"transfer of a business\" means the same as RCW 50.29.063(4)(c).\n\n(1) If the department finds that a significant purpose of the transfer of the business is to obtain a reduced array calculation factor rate, contribution rates shall be computed and penalties and other sanctions shall apply as specified in RCW 50.29.063.\n\n(2) If subsection (1) of this section and RCW 50.29.063 do not apply and if the department finds that an employer is a successor, or partial successor, to a predecessor business, predecessor and successor employer contribution rates shall be computed in the following manner:\n\n(a) If the successor is an employer, as defined in RCW 50.04.080, at the time of the transfer of a business, the following applies:\n\n(i) The successor's contribution rate shall remain unchanged for the remainder of the rate year in which the transfer occurs.\n\n(ii) Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's contribution rate for each rate year shall be based on a combination of the following:\n\n(A) The successor's experience with payrolls and benefits; and\n\n(B) Any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer.
