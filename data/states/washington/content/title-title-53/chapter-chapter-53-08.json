These procedures may be used if an owner mooring or storing a vessel at the moorage facility fails, after being notified that charges are owing and of the owner's right to commence legal proceedings to contest that such charges are owing, to pay the port charges owed or to commence legal proceedings. Notification shall be by registered mail to the owner at his or her last known address. In the case of a transient vessel, or where no address was furnished by the owner, the moorage facility operator need not give such notice prior to securing the vessel.

After entry of judgment, including any appeals, in a court of competent jurisdiction, or after the parties reach agreement with respect to payment, the trust shall terminate and the moorage facility operator shall receive so much of the bond or other security as is agreed, or as is necessary to satisfy any judgment, costs, and interest as may be awarded to the moorage facility operator.

The notice of sale shall be published at least once, more than ten but not more than twenty days before the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the moorage facility is located. Such notice shall include the name of the vessel, if any, the last known owner and address, and a reasonable description of the vessel to be sold. The moorage facility operator may bid all or part of its port charges at the sale and may become a purchaser at the sale.(b) Before the vessel is sold, any person seeking to redeem an impounded vessel under this section may commence a lawsuit in the superior court for the county in which the vessel was impounded to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of the port charges owing.

Under no circumstances shall the port district be obligated to fund or pay for any portion of the retirement agreement expenses for Grays Harbor pilots employed prior to October 1, 2001.(6) A pilot providing pilotage services under this section must comply with all requirements of the pilotage act, chapter 88.16 RCW, and all rules adopted thereunder.\n\nA countywide port district located in part or in whole within the Grays Harbor pilotage district, as defined by RCW 88.16.050(2), may commence pilotage service with the following powers and subject to the conditions contained in this section.\n\n(1) Persons employed to perform the pilotage service of a port district must be licensed under chapter 88.16 RCW to provide pilotage.\n\n(2) Before establishing pilotage service, a port district shall give at least sixty days' written notice to the chair of the board of pilotage commissioners to provide pilotage.\n\n(3) A port district providing pilotage service under this section requiring additional pilots may petition the board of pilotage commissioners to qualify and license as a pilot a person who has passed the examination and is on the waiting list for the training program for the district. If there are no persons on the waiting list, the board shall solicit applicants and offer the examination.\n\n(4) In addition to the power to employ or contract with pilots, a port district providing pilotage services under this section has such other powers as are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of this section including, but not limited to, providing through ownership or contract pilots launches, dispatcher services, or ancillary tug services required for operations or safety.\n\n(5)(a) A port district providing pilotage services under this section may recommend to the utilities and transportation commission tariffs for pilotage services provided under chapter 88.16 RCW, and may recommend to the board of pilotage commissioners rules of service governing its pilotage services for consideration and adoption consistent with RCW 88.16.035. The rules of service, rates, and tariffs recommended by the port district must have been approved in open meetings of the port district thirty or more days after published notice in a newspaper of general circulation and after mailing a copy of the notice to: (i) The utilities and transportation commission for rate and tariff consideration, or (ii) the chair of the board of pilotage commissioners for rules of service consideration. The port district shall release its pilotage budget, including the five-year capital spending plan, prior year pilotage financial statement, and the proposed pilotage tariff, no later than thirty days prior to a public hearing.

The port district shall determine the charge owed as pilot retirement agreement expenses. The charge must be sufficient to cover costs associated with the pilot retirement agreement expenses for Grays Harbor pilots employed prior to October 1, 2001. The revenue collected from the charge must be deposited into an account maintained by the port district solely for the pilot retirement agreement expenses of the Grays Harbor pilots employed prior to October 1, 2001. Under no circumstances shall the port district be obligated to fund or pay for any portion of the retirement agreement expenses for Grays Harbor pilots employed prior to October 1, 2001.\n\n(6) A pilot providing pilotage services under this section must comply with all requirements of the pilotage act, chapter 88.16 RCW, and all rules adopted thereunder.\n\n[ 2018 c 107 s 2; 2010 c 8 s 16003; 2001 2nd sp.s. c 22 s 1.]\n\nEffective date—2018 c 107: See note following RCW 88.16.055.\n\nEffective date—2018 c 107: See note following RCW 88.16.055.\n\nConstruction—2001 2nd sp.s. c 22: \"Nothing in this act is intended to amend chapter 88.16 RCW.\" [ 2001 2nd sp.s. c 22 s 3.]\n\nConstruction—2001 2nd sp.s. c 22: \"Nothing in this act is intended to amend chapter 88.16 RCW.\" [ 2001 2nd sp.s. c 22 s 3.]\n\nEffective date—2001 2nd sp.s. c 22: \"This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately [July 13, 2001].\" [ 2001 2nd sp.s. c 22 s 4.]\n\nEffective date—2001 2nd sp.s. c 22: \"This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately [July 13, 2001].\" [ 2001 2nd sp.s. c 22 s 4.]",

If no provision for such division was made, the debts and assets must be divided amongst the port districts in the same proportion as the property tax assessments were divided amongst the districts.(b) The first property tax levy conducted by a port district after it ceases to conduct a joint property tax levy with another port district must be set so that the levy does not exceed the port district's proportional share of the last levy jointly conducted with one or more other port districts plus additional increases allowed under RCW 84.55.010.\n\n(1) Two or more port districts, operating under a mutual agreement pursuant to RCW 53.08.240, may levy and collect jointly the property tax assessments authorized under RCW 53.36.020 under the following conditions:\n\n(a) The port districts are adjacent, and the boundaries of the port districts are coextensive with county boundaries;\n\n(b) The commissioners of each port district have, no later than July 1st, and by at least a two-thirds margin, voted to conduct a joint property tax levy for collection in the following year and for subsequent years, until such time as the commissioners of each port district have voted to discontinue the joint property tax levy;\n\n(c) The joint property tax levy has been approved by a majority of voters at general elections called under RCW 29A.04.330 by the port district commissioners of the port districts that propose to conduct the joint property tax levy. The general elections within each port district must be held on the same day. If the certified election results show that a majority of the total votes cast among all the port districts participating in the general elections approve the joint property tax levy, then the joint levy shall be deemed approved. Once voters have approved the conduct of a joint property tax levy, the conduct of a joint levy in subsequent consecutive years does not require voter approval; and\n\n(d) The joint property tax rate imposed is the same in each participating port district.\n\n(2) The respective port districts are encouraged and authorized to share information with residents of each county, including mailed items to households, related to the ballot measure.\n\n(3)(a) Two or more port districts that are jointly levying and collecting property taxes as provided for under subsection (1) of this section are considered a \"taxing district\" under RCW 84.04.120.\n\n(b) The commissioners of the port districts that are jointly levying and collecting property taxes under subsection (1) of this section are considered the governing body of the districts for the purposes of RCW 84.55.120.\n\n(4)(a) Port districts that are jointly levying and collecting property taxes as provided for in subsection (1) of this section may not independently conduct a property tax levy under RCW 53.36.020, except as provided in (b) of this subsection.\n\n(b) Port districts conducting a joint levy may independently approve a property tax levy under RCW 53.36.020 to the extent needed to provide for payment of principal and interest on general bonded indebtedness.\n\n(5)(a) Notwithstanding RCW 84.55.035, when conducting a joint property tax levy, the first joint levy amount must be set as provided for in RCW 84.55.020 as if the port districts had consolidated. Subsequent joint levies are subject to the limitations in RCW 84.55.010.\n\n(b) Any increase in the property tax revenue by the jointly taxing port districts may only be authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.120, except that any such increase must be approved by at least two-thirds of the commissioners of each of the port districts.\n\n(c) Port districts that are jointly levying and collecting property taxes may conduct a levy in an amount exceeding the limitations provided for in chapter 84.55 RCW as provided for in RCW 84.55.050, except that such a levy may only be conducted if approved by a majority of voters in each port district participating in the joint property tax levy.\n\n(6) The separate obligations of each of the port districts conducting a joint property tax levy shall not be affected by the conduct of the joint levy, and shall remain the responsibility of the individual port district subject to the obligation. Taxes and assessments for payment of such obligations shall continue to be levied and collected as provided for in subsection (4)(b) of this section in each port district notwithstanding the joint property tax levy. While any such obligations remain outstanding, funds subject to such obligations shall be kept separate.\n\n(7)(a) In the event that two or more port districts operating under a mutual agreement pursuant to RCW 53.08.240 cease to operate under the agreement, the joint debts and assets of the port districts must be divided as provided for in the agreement. If no provision for such division was made, the debts and assets must be divided amongst the port districts in the same proportion as the property tax assessments were divided amongst the districts.\n\n(b) The first property tax levy conducted by a port district after it ceases to conduct a joint property tax levy with another port district must be set so that the levy does not exceed the port district's proportional share of the last levy jointly conducted with one or more other port districts plus additional increases allowed under RCW 84.55.010.\n\n[ 2023 c 215 s 1.]",
