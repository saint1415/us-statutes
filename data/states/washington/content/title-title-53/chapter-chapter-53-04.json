The legislature recognizes a growing need for a Washington port district that is located in a county that has a contiguous border with another state, and a population between fifty and seventy thousand, to participate with other public agencies of this state and an adjoining state to attract, encourage, and develop industry and promote trade on both sides of their borders, for the economic benefit to the state of Washington. RCW 53.08.240 authorizes agreements between two or more port districts for the exercise of powers both within and outside their districts, and further authorizes contracts by port districts with other governmental entities. The interlocal cooperation act, chapter 39.34 RCW, also authorizes joint agreements and contracts between port districts and other state and local public agencies including political subdivisions of other states. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not a port district that is located in a county that has a contiguous border with another state, and a population between fifty and seventy thousand, may exercise industrial development or trade promotion powers outside the district or state boundaries except jointly with another Washington port district.The purpose of this act is to define and clarify the authority of a Washington port district that is located in a county that has a contiguous border with another state, and a population between fifty and seventy thousand, to exercise those powers jointly or in cooperation with other public agencies when found to be necessary and beneficial to the people of this state.\" [ 1999 c 306 s 1.]\n\nPurpose—1999 c 306: \"Article VIII, section 8 of the Washington state Constitution authorizes the use of public funds by port districts in such manner as the legislature may prescribe for industrial development or trade promotion.
