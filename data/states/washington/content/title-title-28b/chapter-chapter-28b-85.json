In connection with the investigation, the council may administer oaths and affirmations, issue subpoenas and compel attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memorandums, or other records which the council deems relevant or material to the investigation. The council, including its staff and any other authorized persons, may conduct site inspections, the cost of which shall be borne by the institution, and examine records of all institutions subject to this chapter;(c) Is responsible for maintaining and developing interstate reciprocity agreements with other state or multistate entities if the agreements are consistent with the purposes in this chapter as determined by the council, and provided that, beginning July 1, 2028, the agreements:(i) Do not suspend, supersede, or reduce student consumer protections or the authority of the council to investigate and enforce provisions of this chapter;(ii) Maintain the authority and capabilities of the council to investigate complaints of students who are residents of, or domiciled in, Washington in regard to compliance provisions of this chapter for distance, online, or other degree programs;(iii) Do not reduce surety or bond requirements for institutions adopted by the council pursuant to this chapter; and(iv) Ensure disclosure of any investigation, suspension, or provisional status relating to either financial instability, eligibility for participation in federal or state financial aid programs, or accreditation requirements to the council and students of the institutions, or prospective students, residing in Washington;(d) May enter into agreements with degree-granting institutions of higher education based in this state, that are otherwise exempt under the provisions of (a) of this subsection, for the purpose of ensuring consistent consumer protection in interstate distance delivery of higher education;(e) Shall develop an interagency agreement with the workforce training and education coordinating board to regulate degree-granting private vocational schools with respect to degree and nondegree programs; and(f) Shall develop and disseminate information to the public about entities that sell or award degrees without requiring appropriate academic achievement at the postsecondary level, including but not limited to, a description of the substandard and potentially fraudulent practices of these entities, and advice about how the public can recognize and avoid the entities.

Ruckelshaus center to conduct a two-part study analyzing the system of for-profit degree-granting institutions and private vocational schools in Washington. The Ruckelshaus center issued its first report in December 2016, followed by facilitated discussions amongst agencies and stakeholders that resulted in a second report issued in 2017. This act incorporates some of the findings and recommendations from the first phase of the report, including the benefits of ensuring that recruitment advertising and materials are consistent with state and federal verified data. In addition, this act incorporates findings regarding the need for a single student complaint portal and for agencies to have timely access to trust funds for tuition recovery and other methods of responding when schools close. This act also authorizes the second part of the study, as recommended by the center, that will include discussions of agency jurisdiction and consistency and how to improve the agencies' abilities to respond to school closures.(2) The legislature finds that there are many private for-profit and nonprofit career colleges and degree-granting institutions providing Washington state residents with important postsecondary and career opportunities that contribute to the economic security of Washington residents and aid in meeting the needs of our state's growing economy. The legislature also recognizes that there have been high profile closures of, or federal and other state determinations regarding, some for-profit or formerly for-profit institutions that have damaged the reputation of the sector and impacted the expectations and financial stability of some students. It is the legislature's intent to provide a framework to ensure a level playing field exists for the many institutions that provide disclosures to prospective students based on verifiable metrics, which allow prospective students to be able to make the best decisions on school and career choices and on financial aid and loans to finance their educational goals. The legislature also intends to ensure that students are provided the information they need to make the best decisions for their educational future and careers in event of closure or potential closure of an institution. In addition, the legislature intends to protect the state's interest in the integrity of its grant and aid programs, from private decisions to close schools or programs under circumstances that may prevent students from obtaining the degree or certificate and career services that the students expected upon enrollment.\" [ 2018 c 203 s 1.]\n\nFinding—Intent—2018 c 203: \"(1) In 2016, the student achievement council contracted with the William D. Ruckelshaus center to conduct a two-part study analyzing the system of for-profit degree-granting institutions and private vocational schools in Washington. The Ruckelshaus center issued its first report in December 2016, followed by facilitated discussions amongst agencies and stakeholders that resulted in a second report issued in 2017. This act incorporates some of the findings and recommendations from the first phase of the report, including the benefits of ensuring that recruitment advertising and materials are consistent with state and federal verified data. In addition, this act incorporates findings regarding the need for a single student complaint portal and for agencies to have timely access to trust funds for tuition recovery and other methods of responding when schools close. This act also authorizes the second part of the study, as recommended by the center, that will include discussions of agency jurisdiction and consistency and how to improve the agencies' abilities to respond to school closures.\n\n(2) The legislature finds that there are many private for-profit and nonprofit career colleges and degree-granting institutions providing Washington state residents with important postsecondary and career opportunities that contribute to the economic security of Washington residents and aid in meeting the needs of our state's growing economy. The legislature also recognizes that there have been high profile closures of, or federal and other state determinations regarding, some for-profit or formerly for-profit institutions that have damaged the reputation of the sector and impacted the expectations and financial stability of some students. It is the legislature's intent to provide a framework to ensure a level playing field exists for the many institutions that provide disclosures to prospective students based on verifiable metrics, which allow prospective students to be able to make the best decisions on school and career choices and on financial aid and loans to finance their educational goals.

It also creates a two-tiered system of protection, in which students attending NC-SARA-participating schools receive the benefit of fewer consumer protection laws than students attending schools based in our state or attending schools that do not participate in NC-SARA. This incentivizes NC-SARA participating schools to locate in states with weaker education-specific consumer protection laws, such as financial protections in the event of unanticipated closure, to avoid having to comply with more student-protective laws.
