According to the workforce training and education coordinating board, seventeen percent of Washington businesses had difficulty finding job applicants in 2010. Eleven thousand employers did not fill a vacancy because they lacked qualified job applicants. Fifty-nine percent of projected job openings in Washington state from now until 2017 will require some form of postsecondary education and training.It is the intent of the legislature to provide jobs and opportunity by making Washington the place where the world's most productive companies find the world's most talented people. The legislature intends to accomplish this through the creation of the opportunity scholarship and the opportunity expansion programs to: Help mitigate the impact of tuition increases; increase the number of professional-technical certificates, professional-technical degrees, baccalaureate degrees in high employer demand and other programs, and advanced degrees in health professions; and invest in programs and students to meet market demands for a knowledge-based economy while filling middle-income jobs with a sufficient supply of skilled workers.\n\nThe legislature finds that, despite increases in degree production, there remain acute shortages in high employer demand programs of study, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and health care fields of study.

In making determinations on scholarship recipients, the board shall use county-specific employer high-demand data;\n\n(d) Determine the annual scholarship fund amounts to be awarded to selected students;\n\n(e) Distribute funds to selected students;\n\n(f) Notify institutions of higher education of the rural jobs program recipients who will attend their institutions of higher education and inform them of the scholarship fund amounts and terms of the awards; and\n\n(g) Establish and manage an account as provided under RCW 28B.145.110 to receive donations, grants, contributions from private sources, and state matching funds, and from which to disburse scholarship funds to selected students.\n\n(3) To be eligible for scholarship funds under the rural jobs program, a student must:\n\n(a) Either:\n\n(i) Be a resident of an eligible county;\n\n(ii) Have attended and graduated from a school in an eligible school district; or\n\n(iii) Be enrolled in either a community or technical college established under chapter 28B.50 RCW located in an eligible county or participating in an eligible registered apprenticeship program under chapter 28B.92 RCW in an eligible county;\n\n(b) Be a resident student as defined in the Washington college grant program in RCW 28B.92.200(5)(c);\n\n(c) Be in a certificate, degree, or other industry-recognized credential or training program that has been identified by the board as a program that prepares students for a high employer demand field;\n\n(d) Have a family income that does not exceed seventy percent of the state median family income adjusted for family size; and\n\n(e) Demonstrate financial need according to the free application for federal student aid or the Washington application for state financial aid.\n\n(4) To remain eligible for scholarship funds under the rural jobs program, the student must meet satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an eligible program as established by the program. Rural jobs program eligibility may not extend beyond five years or 125 percent of the published length of the program in which the student is enrolled or the credit or clock-hour equivalent.\n\n(5) A scholarship award under the rural jobs program may not result in a reduction of any gift aid. Nothing in this section creates any right or entitlement.\n\n[ 2023 c 176 s 4; 2022 c 211 s 3; 2021 c 133 s 3; 2018 c 254 s 4.]\n\nEffective date—2023 c 176: See note following RCW 28B.145.010.\n\nEffective date—2023 c 176: See note following RCW 28B.145.010.\n\nFindings—Intent—2021 c 133: See note following RCW 28B.145.010.\n\nFindings—Intent—2021 c 133: See note following RCW 28B.145.010.\n\nFindings—Intent—2018 c 254: \"(1) The legislature recognizes that:(a) According to research from Georgetown University, by the year 2020, seventy percent of jobs in Washington state will require at least some education and training beyond high school, which aligns with Washington's educational attainment goals established under RCW 28B.77.020; and(b) Research by the state board for community and technical colleges and other entities has found that attending college for at least one year and earning a credential results in a substantial boost in earnings for adults who enter a community college with a high school diploma or less.(2) In addition, the legislature finds that:(a) Rural counties face unique challenges to achieving full economic and community development in the face of societal trends that concentrate job and population growth in larger metropolitan areas.
