Studies conducted by the state board for community and technical colleges, the *higher education coordinating board, and the council of presidents confirm that enrollment in higher education compared to demand in this geographic region lags behind enrollment in other parts of the state, particularly for upper-division courses leading to advanced degrees.(2) The legislature also finds that access to high employer demand programs of study is imperative for the state's global competitiveness and economic prosperity, particularly those degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields that align with the workforce skill demands of the regional economy, that support the aerospace industry, and provide skilled undergraduate and graduate-degree engineers required by the largest employers in the aerospace industry cluster.(3) The legislature finds that meeting the long-range goal of greatly expanded access for the population of the region to the widest array of baccalaureate and graduate programs can best be accomplished by assigning responsibility to a research university with multiple experiences in similar settings.(4) Management and leadership of the University Center of North Puget Sound is assigned to Washington State University to meet the needs of the Everett metropolitan area and the north Snohomish, Island, and Skagit county region and the state of Washington for baccalaureate and graduate degrees offered by a state university.

The strategic plan must include a multibiennium budget that addresses both operating and capital expenses required to effectively implement the plan. The strategic plan shall be developed with the collaboration of the University Center at Everett Community College and all the institutions of higher education that provide baccalaureate degrees at the University Center, and community leaders.(b) Center partners must implement the strategic plan with careful attention to the academic and professional standards established and maintained by each institution and by the appropriate accrediting bodies, and to the historic role of each institution's governing board in setting policy.(c) The strategic plan must address expansion of the range and depth of educational opportunities in the region and include strategies that:(i) Build upon baccalaureate and graduate degree offerings at the center;(ii) Meet projected student enrollment demands for baccalaureate, graduate, and certificate programs in the region;(iii) Meet employers' needs for skilled workers by expanding high employer demand programs of study as defined in RCW 28B.50.030, with an initial and ongoing emphasis by Washington State University on undergraduate and graduate science, technology, mathematics, and engineering degree programs, including a variety of engineering disciplines such as civil, mechanical, aeronautical, and aerospace manufacturing;(iv) Coordinate delivery of lower and upper-division courses to maximize student opportunities and resources; and(v) Transfer budget support and resources for the center from Everett Community College to Washington State University.(d) The strategic plan must be completed by December 1, 2012, and submitted to the legislature for review.

Education and assistance may be provided to public agencies, including local governments and other state political subdivisions.\n\n[ 2025 c 417 s 811; 2019 c 287 s 2; 2010 c 37 s 1.]\n\nEffective date—2025 c 417 ss 101-103, 406, 701-709, 808-814, 1102, 1103, and 1305: See note following RCW 82.38.030.\n\nEffective date—2025 c 417 ss 101-103, 406, 701-709, 808-814, 1102, 1103, and 1305: See note following RCW 82.38.030.\n\nFindings—Intent—2025 c 417: See note following RCW 82.38.030.\n\nFindings—Intent—2025 c 417: See note following RCW 82.38.030.\n\nEffective date—2019 c 287 ss 1-7, 12, and 14-23: \"Sections 1 through 7, 12, and 14 through 23 of this act take effect August 1, 2019.\" [ 2019 c 287 s 24.]\n\nEffective date—2019 c 287 ss 1-7, 12, and 14-23: \"Sections 1 through 7, 12, and 14 through 23 of this act take effect August 1, 2019.\" [ 2019 c 287 s 24.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2019 c 287: \"The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric vehicles and vessels and other clean alternative fuel vehicles will help to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. The legislature also finds that an increased reliance on greener transit options will help to further reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions. The legislature further finds that support for clean alternative fuel infrastructure can help to increase adoption of green transportation in the state, as noted in a 2015 joint transportation committee report. It is therefore the legislature's intent to drive green vehicle and vessel adoption and increased green transit use by: (1) Establishing and extending tax incentive programs for alternative fuel vehicles and related infrastructure, including for commercial vehicles; (2) providing funding for a capital grant program to assist transit authorities in reducing the carbon output of their fleets; (3) increasing public and private electric utilities' ability to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure; (4) establishing a technical assistance program for public agencies within the Washington State University's energy program; (5) funding a pilot program to test methods for facilitating access to alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure by low-income residents of the state; (6) funding a study to examine opportunities to provide financing assistance to lower-income residents of the state who would like to purchase an electric vehicle; and (7) establishing a tax incentive program for certain electric vessels.\" [ 2019 c 287 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2019 c 287: \"The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric vehicles and vessels and other clean alternative fuel vehicles will help to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state.
