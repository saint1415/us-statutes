The legislature also finds that a citizen's place of residence can restrict that citizen's access to educational opportunity at the upper-division and graduate level.Because most of the state-supported baccalaureate universities are located in areas removed from major metropolitan areas, the legislature finds that many of the state's citizens, especially those citizens residing in the central Puget Sound area, the Tri-Cities, Spokane, Vancouver, and Yakima, have insufficient and inequitable access to upper-division baccalaureate and graduate education.This lack of sufficient educational opportunities in urban areas makes it difficult or impossible for place-bound individuals, who are unable to relocate, to complete a baccalaureate or graduate degree. It also exacerbates the difficulty financially needy students have in attending school, since many of those students need to work, and work is not always readily available in some communities where the baccalaureate institutions of higher education are located.The lack of sufficient educational opportunities in metropolitan areas also affects the economy of the underserved communities. Businesses benefit from access to the research and teaching capabilities of institutions of higher education. The absence of these institutions from some of the state's major urban centers prevents beneficial interaction between businesses in these communities and the state's universities.The Washington state master plan for higher education, adopted by the *higher education coordinating board, recognizes the need to expand upper-division and graduate educational opportunities in the state's large urban centers. The board has also attempted to provide a means for helping to meet future educational demand through a system of campuses in the state's major urban areas.The legislature endorses the assignment of responsibility to serve these urban centers that the board has made to various institutions of higher education. The legislature also endorses the creation of campuses for the University of Washington and Washington State University.The legislature recognizes that, among their other responsibilities, the state's comprehensive community colleges share with the four-year universities and colleges the responsibility of providing the first two years of a baccalaureate education. It is the intent of the legislature that the four-year institutions and the community colleges work as cooperative partners to ensure the successful and efficient operation of the state's system of higher education. The legislature further intends that the four-year institutions work cooperatively with the community colleges to ensure that the campuses created under this chapter are operated as models of a two plus two educational system.\n\nThe legislature finds that the benefits of higher education should be more widely available to the citizens of the state of Washington.

Located in growing urban areas, the campuses were charged with two missions:(a) Increasing access to higher education by focusing on upper-division and graduate programs, targeting placebound students, and operating as models of a two plus two educational system in cooperation with the community colleges; and(b) Promoting regional economic development by responding to demand for degrees from local businesses and supporting regional economies through research activities.(2) Fifteen years later, the legislature finds that the campuses are responding to their original mission:(a) The campuses accounted for half of statewide upper-division and graduate public enrollment growth since 1990;(b) The campuses have grown steadily and enroll increasing numbers of transfer students each year;(c) The campuses enroll proportionately more older and part-time students than their main campuses and attract increasing proportions of students from nearby counties;(d) Although the extent of their impact has not been measured, these campuses positively affect local economies and offer degree programs that roughly correspond with regional occupational projections; and(e) The capital investments made by the state to support the campuses represent a significant benefit to regional economic development.(3) However, the legislature also finds the policy landscape in higher education has changed since the original creation of the campuses. Demand for access to baccalaureate and graduate education is increasing rapidly. Economic development efforts increasingly recognize the importance of focusing on local and regional economic clusters and improving collaboration among communities, businesses, and colleges and universities. Each campus has evolved into a unique institution, and it is appropriate to assess the nature of this evolution to ensure the role and mission of each campus is aligned with the state's higher education goals and the needs of the region where the campus is located.(4) Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to recognize the unique nature of Washington's higher education campuses created under this chapter, reaffirm the role and mission of each, and set the course for their continued future development.(5) It is the further intent of the legislature that the campuses be identified by the following names: University of Washington Bothell, University of Washington Tacoma, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Washington State University Vancouver.\n\n(1) In 1989, the legislature created five campuses to be operated by the state's two public research universities.

The top priority for each of the campuses is to expand courses and degree programs for transfer and graduate students. New degree programs should be driven by the educational needs and demands of students and the community, as well as the economic development needs of local businesses and employers.(2) The campuses created under this chapter shall collaborate with the community and technical colleges in their region to develop articulation agreements, dual admissions policies, and other partnerships to ensure that the campuses serve as innovative models of a two plus two educational system. Other possibilities for collaboration include but are not limited to joint development of curricula and degree programs, colocation of instruction, and arrangements to share faculty.(3) In communities where a private postsecondary institution is located, representatives of the private institution may be invited to participate in the conversation about meeting the baccalaureate and graduate needs in underserved urban areas of the state.(4) However, the legislature recognizes there are alternative models for achieving this primary mission. Some campuses may have additional missions in response to regional needs and demands. At selected campuses, an innovative combination of instruction and research targeted to support regional economic development may be appropriate to meet the region's needs for both access and economic viability. Other campuses should focus on becoming models of a two plus two educational system through continuous improvement of partnerships and agreements with community and technical colleges. Still other campuses may be best suited to transition to a four-year university.(5) The legislature recognizes that size, mix of degree programs, and proportion of lower versus upper-division and graduate enrollments are factors that affect costs at the campuses.

Furthermore, the campuses have contributed to community revitalization and economic development in their regions. The campuses have met their overall mission through the development of new degree programs and through collaboration with community and technical colleges. These findings were confirmed by a comprehensive review of the campuses by the Washington state institute for public policy in 2002 and 2003, and reaffirmed through legislation enacted in 2004 that directed four of the campuses to make recommendations for their future evolution.(2) The self-studies conducted by the University of Washington Bothell, University of Washington Tacoma, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Washington State University Vancouver reflect thoughtful and strategic planning and involved the input of numerous students, faculty, community and business leaders, community colleges, advisory committees, and board members. The *higher education coordinating board's careful review provides a statewide context for the legislature to implement the next stage of the campuses.(3) Concurrently, the *higher education coordinating board has developed a strategic master plan for higher education that sets a goal of increasing the number of students who earn college degrees at all levels: Associate, baccalaureate, and graduate. The strategic master plan also sets a goal to increase the higher education system's responsiveness to the state's economic needs.(4) The legislature finds that to meet both of the master plan's goals and to provide adequate educational opportunities for Washington's citizens, additional access is needed to baccalaureate degree programs. Expansion of the four campuses is one strategy for achieving the desired outcomes of the master plan. Other strategies must also be implemented through service delivery models that reflect both regional demands and statewide priorities.(5) Therefore, the legislature intends to increase baccalaureate access and encourage economic development through overall expansion of upper-division capacity, continued development of two plus two programs in some areas of the state, authorization of four-year university programs in other areas of the state, and creation of new types of baccalaureate programs on a pilot basis.
