The legislature finds that American Indian students are underrepresented in Washington's colleges and universities. The legislature also finds that past discriminatory practices have resulted in this underrepresentation. Creating an endowed scholarship program to help American Indian students obtain a higher education will help to rectify past discrimination by providing a means and an incentive for American Indian students to pursue a higher education.
