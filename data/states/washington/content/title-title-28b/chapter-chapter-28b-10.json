To raise the levels of skills and knowledge needed to sustain the state's economic prosperity and competitive position in a global environment, the public higher education system must reach out to every prospective student and citizen in unprecedented ways, with unprecedented focus.To reach out to these citizens, the state must dismantle the barriers of geographic isolation, cost, and competing demands of work and family life.
