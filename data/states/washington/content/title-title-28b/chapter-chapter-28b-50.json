Student members learn processes of institutional governance, analyze policy proposals, and participate in board discussions and decision making.\n\nTherefore, it is the intent of the legislature to enhance community college governance by the state board of [for] community and technical colleges through fostering a stronger relationship with students in policy development and decision making at the state level.\" [ 2025 c 91 s 1.]\n\nLegislative findings—Severability—Effective date—1984 c 287: See notes following RCW 43.03.220.\n\nLegislative findings—Severability—Effective date—1984 c 287: See notes following RCW 43.03.220.\n\nEffective date—Severability—1975-'76 2nd ex.s. c 34: See notes following RCW 2.08.115.\n\nEffective date—Severability—1975-'76 2nd ex.s. c 34: See notes following RCW 2.08.115.\n\nSavings—Severability—1973 c 62: See notes following RCW 28B.10.510.\n\nSavings—Severability—1973 c 62: See notes following RCW 28B.10.510.\n\nSeverability—1969 ex.s. c 261: See note following RCW 28B.50.020.\n\nSeverability—1969 ex.s. c 261: See note following RCW 28B.50.020.\n\nAppointment of director of state system of community and technical colleges, by: RCW 28B.50.060.\n\nAppointment of director of state system of community and technical colleges, by: RCW 28B.50.060.\n\nEmployees of, appointment and employment of: RCW 28B.50.060.\n\nEmployees of, appointment and employment of: RCW 28B.50.060.\n\nOccupational forecast—Agency consultation: RCW 50.38.030.\n\nOccupational forecast—Agency consultation: RCW 50.38.030.\n\nPowers and duties: RCW 28B.50.090.\n\nPowers and duties: RCW 28B.50.090.",

The agreement must also include a provision that requires an eligible employee to forfeit remuneration under subsection (4) of this section if the employee belongs to a unit that has been designated to participate in the benefit plan permitted under this subsection and the employee refuses to execute the required agreement.(6) Remuneration or benefits received under this section are not included for the purposes of computing a retirement allowance under a public retirement system in this state.(7) The state board for community and technical colleges shall adopt uniform rules to carry out the purposes of this section. The rules shall define categories of eligible employees. The categories of eligible employees are subject to approval by the office of financial management. The rules shall also require that each employer maintain complete and accurate sick leave records for all eligible employees.(8) Should the legislature revoke a remuneration or benefit granted under this section, an affected employee is not then entitled to receive the benefits as a matter of contractual right.\n\n(1) Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.\n\n(a) \"Employer\" means the board of trustees for each college district or the state board for community and technical colleges.\n\n(b) \"Eligible employee\" means an employee of a college district or the state board for community and technical colleges who belongs to one of the following classifications:\n\n(i) Academic employees as defined in RCW 28B.52.020;\n\n(ii) Classified employees of technical colleges whose employment is governed under chapter 41.56 RCW;\n\n(iii) Professional, paraprofessional, and administrative employees exempt from chapter 41.06 RCW; and\n\n(iv) Employees of the state board for community and technical colleges who are exempt from chapter 41.06 RCW.\n\n(2) An attendance incentive program is established for all eligible employees of a college district or the state board for community and technical colleges entitled to accumulate sick leave and for whom accurate sick leave records have been maintained. An eligible employee may not receive compensation under this section for a portion of sick leave accumulated at a rate in excess of one day per month.\n\n(3) In January of the year following a year in which a minimum of sixty days of sick leave is accrued, and each following January, an eligible employee may exercise an option to receive remuneration for unused sick leave accumulated in the previous year at a rate equal to one day's monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days of accrued sick leave in excess of sixty days. Sick leave for which compensation has been received shall be deducted from accrued sick leave at the rate of four days for every one day's monetary compensation.\n\n(4) At the time of separation from employment with a college district or the state board for community and technical colleges due to retirement or death, an eligible employee or the employee's estate may receive remuneration at a rate equal to one day's current monetary compensation of the employee for each four full days' accrued sick leave.\n\n(5) In lieu of remuneration for unused sick leave at retirement as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an employer may, with equivalent funds, provide eligible employees with a benefit plan that provides reimbursement for medical expenses. For employees whose conditions of employment are governed by chapter 28B.52 or 41.56 RCW, such benefit plans shall be instituted only by agreement applicable to the members of a bargaining unit. A benefit plan adopted must require, as a condition of participation under the plan, that the employee sign an agreement with the employer. The agreement must include a provision to hold the employer harmless should the United States government find that the employer or the employee is in debt to the United States as a result of the employee not paying income taxes due on the equivalent funds placed into the plan, or as a result of the employer not withholding or deducting a tax, assessment, or other payment on the funds as required under federal law. The agreement must also include a provision that requires an eligible employee to forfeit remuneration under subsection (4) of this section if the employee belongs to a unit that has been designated to participate in the benefit plan permitted under this subsection and the employee refuses to execute the required agreement.\n\n(6) Remuneration or benefits received under this section are not included for the purposes of computing a retirement allowance under a public retirement system in this state.\n\n(7) The state board for community and technical colleges shall adopt uniform rules to carry out the purposes of this section.

According to one recent report, the highest rates of prison admissions are in rural counties. In addition, since 1980, the number of women in prison has increased more than eight hundred percent. Additionally, people of color are overrepresented in the prison system. The legislature finds that studies clearly and consistently demonstrate that postsecondary education in prisons improves safety in facilities, and incarcerated adults who obtain postsecondary education and training are more likely to be employed following release, which leads to a significant reduction in recidivism rates, improvements in public safety, and a major return on investment. The legislature finds that reducing recidivism decreases the financial burden to taxpayers and the emotional burden of victims.(2) The legislature finds that research indicates that postsecondary education and training is an effective evidence-based practice for reducing recidivism. An analysis commissioned by the United States department of justice determined that adults who received an education while incarcerated were forty-three percent less likely to recidivate.(3) Ninety-five percent of incarcerated adults ultimately return to their communities to obtain employment and contribute to society. The legislature finds that according to the bureau of labor statistics, unemployment rates for people with only a high school education are twice that of those with an associate degree. Research has shown that adults who participated in education programs while incarcerated were thirteen percent more likely to be employed.(4) The legislature further finds that correctional education is cost-effective. A 2014 study by the Washington state institute for public policy estimated that, based on a review of national research literature and cost-benefit analysis, there is a return on investment of twenty dollars for every dollar invested in correctional education.(5) It is the intent of the legislature to enhance public safety, including the safety of prison workers as findings show that violence rates are reduced in institutions where there are educational programs, to reduce crime, and to increase employment rates in a cost-effective manner by exploring benefits and costs associated with providing postsecondary education degree opportunities and training to incarcerated adults through expanded partnerships between postsecondary institutions, nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs, and the department of corrections.(6) It is the intent of the legislature to support exploring the use of secure internet connections expressly for the purposes of furthering postsecondary education degree opportunities and training of incarcerated adults, including providing assistance to incarcerated adults with completing financial aid materials. The legislature intends for the department to be able to provide complete assurance that all internet connections used by incarcerated individuals are secure.(7) It is the intent of the legislature to support expanded access and opportunities to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs for persons of color by setting goals and partnering with nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs with historical evidence of providing education programs for people of color.(8) It is also the intent of the legislature, by requiring the study under RCW 72.09.469, to examine the effects of providing postsecondary education while incarcerated on enrollment in the postsecondary education system postrelease.\" [ 2021 c 200 s 1; 2019 c 397 s 1; 2017 c 120 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2021 c 200; 2019 c 397; 2017 c 120: \"(1) The legislature finds that incarceration is both a rural and urban issue in the state. According to one recent report, the highest rates of prison admissions are in rural counties. In addition, since 1980, the number of women in prison has increased more than eight hundred percent. Additionally, people of color are overrepresented in the prison system. The legislature finds that studies clearly and consistently demonstrate that postsecondary education in prisons improves safety in facilities, and incarcerated adults who obtain postsecondary education and training are more likely to be employed following release, which leads to a significant reduction in recidivism rates, improvements in public safety, and a major return on investment. The legislature finds that reducing recidivism decreases the financial burden to taxpayers and the emotional burden of victims.\n\n(2) The legislature finds that research indicates that postsecondary education and training is an effective evidence-based practice for reducing recidivism. An analysis commissioned by the United States department of justice determined that adults who received an education while incarcerated were forty-three percent less likely to recidivate.\n\n(3) Ninety-five percent of incarcerated adults ultimately return to their communities to obtain employment and contribute to society. The legislature finds that according to the bureau of labor statistics, unemployment rates for people with only a high school education are twice that of those with an associate degree. Research has shown that adults who participated in education programs while incarcerated were thirteen percent more likely to be employed.\n\n(4) The legislature further finds that correctional education is cost-effective. A 2014 study by the Washington state institute for public policy estimated that, based on a review of national research literature and cost-benefit analysis, there is a return on investment of twenty dollars for every dollar invested in correctional education.\n\n(5) It is the intent of the legislature to enhance public safety, including the safety of prison workers as findings show that violence rates are reduced in institutions where there are educational programs, to reduce crime, and to increase employment rates in a cost-effective manner by exploring benefits and costs associated with providing postsecondary education degree opportunities and training to incarcerated adults through expanded partnerships between postsecondary institutions, nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs, and the department of corrections.\n\n(6) It is the intent of the legislature to support exploring the use of secure internet connections expressly for the purposes of furthering postsecondary education degree opportunities and training of incarcerated adults, including providing assistance to incarcerated adults with completing financial aid materials.

Any such determination by the hearing officer under this section shall not be subject to further tenure review committee action as otherwise provided in this chapter.Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at the time of a faculty member or members request for formal hearing said faculty member or members may ask for participation in the choosing of the hearing officer in the manner provided in RCW 28A.405.310(4), said employee therein being a faculty member for the purposes hereof and said board of directors therein being the board of trustees for the purposes hereof: PROVIDED, That where there is more than one faculty member affected by the board of trustees' reduction in force such faculty members requesting hearing must act collectively in making such request: PROVIDED FURTHER, That costs incurred for the services and expenses of such hearing officer shall be shared equally by the community or technical college and the faculty member or faculty members requesting hearing.When more than one faculty member is notified of termination because of a reduction in force as provided in this section, hearings for all such faculty members requesting formal hearing shall be consolidated and only one such hearing for the affected faculty members shall be held, and such consolidated hearing shall be concluded within the time frame set forth herein.Separation from service without prejudice after formal hearing under the provisions of this section shall become effective upon final action by the board of trustees.It is the intent of the legislature by enactment of this section and in accordance with RCW 28B.52.035, to modify any collective bargaining agreements in effect, or any conflicting board policies or rules, so that any reductions in force which take place after December 21, 1981, whether in progress or to be initiated, will comply solely with the provisions of this section: PROVIDED, That any applicable policies, rules, or provisions contained in a collective bargaining agreement related to lay-off units, seniority and reemployment rights shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph.Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the right of the board of trustees or its designated appointing authority not to renew a probationary faculty appointment pursuant to RCW 28B.50.857.\n\nThe college board may declare a financial emergency under the following conditions: (1) Reduction of allotments by the governor pursuant to *RCW 43.88.110(2), or (2) reduction by the legislature from one biennium to the next or within a biennium of appropriated funds based on constant dollars using the implicit price deflator. When a district board of trustees determines that a reduction in force of tenured or probationary faculty members may be necessary due to financial emergency as declared by the state board, written notice of the reduction in force and separation from employment shall be given the faculty members so affected by the president or district president as the case may be. Said notice shall clearly indicate that separation is not due to the job performance of the employee and hence is without prejudice to such employee and need only state in addition the basis for the reduction in force as one or more of the reasons enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.\n\nSaid tenured or probationary faculty members will have a right to request a formal hearing when being dismissed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The only issue to be determined shall be whether under the applicable policies, rules or collective bargaining agreement the particular faculty member or members advised of severance are the proper ones to be terminated. Said hearing shall be initiated by filing a written request therefor with the president or district president, as the case may be, within ten days after issuance of such notice. At such formal hearing the tenure review committee provided for in RCW 28B.50.863 may observe the formal hearing procedure and after the conclusion of such hearing offer its recommended decision for consideration by the hearing officer. Failure to timely request such a hearing shall cause separation from service of such faculty members so notified on the effective date as stated in the notice, regardless of the duration of any individual employment contract.\n\nThe hearing required by this section shall be an adjudicative proceeding pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act, conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the board of trustees and shall be concluded by the hearing officer within sixty days after written notice of the reduction in force has been issued. Ten days written notice of the formal hearing will be given to faculty members who have requested such a hearing by the president or district president as the case may be. The hearing officer within ten days after conclusion of such formal hearing shall prepare findings, conclusions of law and a recommended decision which shall be forwarded to the board of trustees for its final action thereon.
