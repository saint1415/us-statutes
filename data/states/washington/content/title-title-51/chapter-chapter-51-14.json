Each application for certification as a self-insurer submitted by an employer shall be accompanied by payment of a fee of one hundred fifty dollars or such larger sum as the director shall find necessary for the administrative costs of evaluation of the applicant's qualifications. Any employer who has formerly been certified as a self-insurer and thereafter ceases to be so certified may not apply for certification within three years of ceasing to have been so certified.(2)(a) A self-insurer may be required by the director to supplement existing financial ability by depositing in an escrow account in a depository designated by the director, money and/or corporate or governmental securities approved by the director, or a surety bond written by any company admitted to transact surety business in this state, or provide an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a federally or state chartered commercial banking institution authorized to conduct business in the state of Washington filed with the department. The money, securities, bond, or letter of credit shall be in an amount reasonably sufficient in the director's discretion to insure payment of reasonably foreseeable compensation and assessments but not less than the employer's normal expected annual claim liabilities and in no event less than one hundred thousand dollars. In arriving at the amount of money, securities, bond, or letter of credit required under this subsection, the director shall take into consideration the financial ability of the employer to pay compensation and assessments and his or her probable continuity of operation.

Such reinsurance may not exceed eighty percent of the liabilities under this title.(6) For purposes of the application of this section, the department may adopt separate rules establishing the security requirements applicable to units of local government. In setting such requirements, the department shall take into consideration the ability of the governmental unit to meet its self-insured obligations, such as but not limited to source of funds, permanency, and right of default.(7) The director shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section including, but not limited to, rules respecting the terms and conditions of letters of credit and the establishment of the appropriate level of net worth of the self-insurer to qualify for use of the letter of credit.
