To reduce litigation and establish more certainty and uniformity in the rating of unspecified permanent partial disabilities, the department shall enact rules having the force of law classifying such disabilities in the proportion which the department shall determine such disabilities reasonably bear to total bodily impairment.

Beginning on July 1, 1993, total compensation for all unspecified permanent partial disabilities resulting from the same injury shall not exceed a sum calculated as follows:(i) Beginning on July 1, 1993, the sum shall be increased to one hundred eighteen thousand eight hundred dollars; and(ii) Beginning on July 1, 1994, and each July 1 thereafter, the sum prescribed in (b)(i) of this subsection shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section.(4) If permanent partial disability compensation is followed by permanent total disability compensation, all permanent partial disability compensation paid to the worker under the claim or claims for which total permanent disability compensation is awarded shall be, at the choosing of the injured worker, either: (a) Deducted from the worker's monthly pension benefits until the total award or awards paid are recovered; or (b) deducted from the pension reserve of such injured worker and his or her monthly compensation payments shall be reduced accordingly. Any interest paid on any permanent partial disability compensation may not be deducted from the pension benefits or pension reserve. The provisions of this subsection apply to all permanent total disability determinations issued on or after July 1, 2011.(5) Should a worker receive an injury to a member or part of his or her body already, from whatever cause, permanently partially disabled, resulting in the amputation thereof or in an aggravation or increase in such permanent partial disability but not resulting in the permanent total disability of such worker, his or her compensation for such partial disability shall be adjudged with regard to the previous disability of the injured member or part and the degree or extent of the aggravation or increase of disability thereof.(6) When the compensation provided for in subsections (1) through (3) of this section exceeds three times the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018, payment shall be made in monthly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments set forth in RCW 51.32.090 until such compensation is paid to the injured worker in full, except that the first monthly payment shall be in an amount equal to three times the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018.

compensation under this subsection shall be computed as follows:\n\n(i) Beginning on July 1, 1993, the compensation amounts for the specified disabilities listed in (a) of this subsection shall be increased by thirty-two percent; and\n\n(ii) Beginning on July 1, 1994, and each July 1 thereafter, the compensation amounts for the specified disabilities listed in (a) of this subsection, as adjusted under (b)(i) of this subsection, shall be readjusted to reflect the percentage change in the consumer price index, calculated as follows: The index for the calendar year preceding the year in which the July calculation is made, to be known as \"calendar year A,\" is divided by the index for the calendar year preceding calendar year A, and the resulting ratio is multiplied by the compensation amount in effect on June 30 immediately preceding the July 1st on which the respective calculation is made. For the purposes of this subsection, \"index\" means the same as the definition in RCW 2.12.037(1).\n\n(2) Compensation for amputation of a member or part thereof at a site other than those specified in subsection (1) of this section, and for loss of central visual acuity and loss of hearing other than complete, shall be in proportion to that which such other amputation or partial loss of visual acuity or hearing most closely resembles and approximates. Compensation shall be calculated based on the adjusted schedule of compensation in effect for the respective time period as prescribed in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n(3)(a) Compensation for any other permanent partial disability not involving amputation shall be in the proportion which the extent of such other disability, called unspecified disability, shall bear to the disabilities specified in subsection (1) of this section, which most closely resembles and approximates in degree of disability such other disability, and compensation for any other unspecified permanent partial disability shall be in an amount as measured and compared to total bodily impairment. To reduce litigation and establish more certainty and uniformity in the rating of unspecified permanent partial disabilities, the department shall enact rules having the force of law classifying such disabilities in the proportion which the department shall determine such disabilities reasonably bear to total bodily impairment. In enacting such rules, the department shall give consideration to, but need not necessarily adopt, any nationally recognized medical standards or guides for determining various bodily impairments.\n\n(b) Until July 1, 1993, for purposes of calculating monetary benefits under (a) of this subsection, the amount payable for total bodily impairment shall be deemed to be ninety thousand dollars. Beginning on July 1, 1993, for purposes of calculating monetary benefits under (a) of this subsection, the amount payable for total bodily impairment shall be adjusted as follows:\n\n(i) Beginning on July 1, 1993, the amount payable for total bodily impairment under this section shall be increased to one hundred eighteen thousand eight hundred dollars; and\n\n(ii) Beginning on July 1, 1994, and each July 1 thereafter, the amount payable for total bodily impairment prescribed in (b)(i) of this subsection shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section.\n\n(c) Until July 1, 1993, the total compensation for all unspecified permanent partial disabilities resulting from the same injury shall not exceed the sum of ninety thousand dollars. Beginning on July 1, 1993, total compensation for all unspecified permanent partial disabilities resulting from the same injury shall not exceed a sum calculated as follows:\n\n(i) Beginning on July 1, 1993, the sum shall be increased to one hundred eighteen thousand eight hundred dollars; and\n\n(ii) Beginning on July 1, 1994, and each July 1 thereafter, the sum prescribed in (b)(i) of this subsection shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section.\n\n(4) If permanent partial disability compensation is followed by permanent total disability compensation, all permanent partial disability compensation paid to the worker under the claim or claims for which total permanent disability compensation is awarded shall be, at the choosing of the injured worker, either: (a) Deducted from the worker's monthly pension benefits until the total award or awards paid are recovered; or (b) deducted from the pension reserve of such injured worker and his or her monthly compensation payments shall be reduced accordingly. Any interest paid on any permanent partial disability compensation may not be deducted from the pension benefits or pension reserve. The provisions of this subsection apply to all permanent total disability determinations issued on or after July 1, 2011.\n\n(5) Should a worker receive an injury to a member or part of his or her body already, from whatever cause, permanently partially disabled, resulting in the amputation thereof or in an aggravation or increase in such permanent partial disability but not resulting in the permanent total disability of such worker, his or her compensation for such partial disability shall be adjudged with regard to the previous disability of the injured member or part and the degree or extent of the aggravation or increase of disability thereof.\n\n(6) When the compensation provided for in subsections (1) through (3) of this section exceeds three times the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018, payment shall be made in monthly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments set forth in RCW 51.32.090 until such compensation is paid to the injured worker in full, except that the first monthly payment shall be in an amount equal to three times the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018. Upon application of the injured worker or survivor the monthly payment may be converted, in whole or in part, into a lump sum payment, in which event the monthly payment shall cease in whole or in part. Such conversion may be made only upon written application of the injured worker or survivor to the department and shall rest in the discretion of the department depending upon the merits of each individual application. Upon the death of a worker all unpaid installments accrued shall be paid according to the payment schedule established prior to the death of the worker to the widow or widower, or if there is no widow or widower surviving, to the dependent children of such claimant, and if there are no such dependent children, then to such other dependents as defined by this title.\n\n(7) Awards payable under this section are governed by the schedule in effect on the date of injury.\n\n[ 2011 1st sp.s. c 37 s 401; 2007 c 172 s 1; 1993 c 520 s 1; 1988 c 161 s 6; 1986 c 58 s 2; 1982 1st ex.s. c 20 s 2; 1979 c 104 s 1; 1977 ex.s. c 350 s 46; 1972 ex.s. c 43 s 21; 1971 ex.s. c 289 s 10; 1965 ex.s. c 165 s 1; 1961 c 274 s 3; 1961 c 23 s 51.32.080.

      "text": "RCW 51.32.090\n\nTemporary total disability—Partial restoration of earning power—Return to available work—When employer continues wages—Limitations—Finding—Rules.\n\n(1) When the total disability is only temporary, the schedule of payments contained in *RCW 51.32.060 (1) and (2) shall apply, so long as the total disability continues.(2) Any compensation payable under this section for children not in the custody of the injured worker as of the date of injury shall be payable only to such person as actually is providing the support for such child or children pursuant to the order of a court of record providing for support of such child or children.(3)(a) As soon as recovery is so complete that the present earning power of the worker, at any kind of work, is restored to that existing at the time of the occurrence of the injury, the payments shall cease. If and so long as the present earning power is only partially restored, the payments shall:(i) For claims for injuries that occurred before May 7, 1993, continue in the proportion which the new earning power shall bear to the old; or(ii) For claims for injuries occurring on or after May 7, 1993, equal 80 percent of the actual difference between the worker's present wages and earning power at the time of injury, but: (A) The total of these payments and the worker's present wages may not exceed 150 percent of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under RCW 51.08.018; (B) the payments may not exceed 100 percent of the entitlement as computed under subsection (1) of this section; and (C) the payments may not be less than the worker would have received if (a)(i) of this subsection had been applicable to the worker's claim.(b) No compensation shall be payable under this subsection (3) unless the loss of earning power shall exceed five percent.(c) The prior closure of the claim or the receipt of permanent partial disability benefits shall not affect the rate at which loss of earning power benefits are calculated upon reopening the claim.(4)(a) The legislature finds that long-term disability and the cost of injuries is significantly reduced when injured workers remain at work following their injury. To encourage employers at the time of injury to provide light duty or transitional work for their workers, wage subsidies and other incentives are made available to employers insured with the department.(b) Whenever the employer of injury requests that a worker who is entitled to temporary total disability under this chapter be certified by the attending provider as able to perform available work other than his or her usual work, the employer shall furnish to the attending provider, with a copy to the worker, a statement describing the work available with the employer of injury in terms that will enable the attending provider to relate the activities of the job to the worker's disability. The attending provider shall then determine whether the worker is able to perform the work described. The worker's temporary total disability payments shall continue until the worker is released by his or her attending provider for the work, and begins the work with the employer of injury. If the work thereafter comes to an end before the worker's recovery is sufficient in the judgment of his or her attending provider to permit him or her to return to his or her usual job, or to perform other available work offered by the employer of injury, the worker's temporary total disability payments shall be resumed. Should the available work described, once undertaken by the worker, impede his or her recovery to the extent that in the judgment of his or her attending provider he or she should not continue to work, the worker's temporary total disability payments shall be resumed when the worker ceases such work.(c) To further encourage employers to maintain the employment of their injured workers, an employer insured with the department and that offers work to a worker pursuant to this subsection (4) shall be eligible for reimbursement of the injured worker's wages for light duty or transitional work equal to 50 percent of the basic, gross wages paid for that work, for a maximum of 120 workdays within a consecutive 24-month period. In no event may the wage subsidies paid to an employer on a claim exceed $25,000. Wage subsidies shall be calculated using the worker's basic hourly wages or basic salary, and no subsidy shall be paid for any other form of compensation or payment to the worker such as tips, commissions, bonuses, board, housing, fuel, health care, dental care, vision care, per diem, reimbursements for work-related expenses, or any other payments. An employer may not, under any circumstances, receive a wage subsidy for a day in which the worker did not actually perform any work, regardless of whether or not the employer paid the worker wages for that day.(d) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4) and the worker must be provided with training or instruction to be qualified to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for a reimbursement from the department for any tuition, books, fees, and materials required for that training or instruction, up to a maximum of $2,000. Reimbursing an employer for the costs of such training or instruction does not constitute a determination by the department that the worker is eligible for vocational services authorized by RCW 51.32.095.(e) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4), and the employer provides the worker with clothing that is necessary to allow the worker to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for reimbursement for such clothing from the department, up to a maximum of $1,000. However, an employer shall not receive reimbursement for any clothing it provided to the worker that it normally provides to its workers. The clothing purchased for the worker shall become the worker's property once the work comes to an end.(f) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4) and the worker must be provided with tools or equipment to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for a reimbursement from the department for such tools and equipment and related costs as determined by department rule, up to a maximum of $5,000. An employer shall not be reimbursed for any tools or equipment purchased prior to offering the work to the worker pursuant to this subsection (4). An employer shall not be reimbursed for any tools or equipment that it normally provides to its workers. The tools and equipment shall be the property of the employer.(g) An employer may offer work to a worker pursuant to this subsection (4) more than once, but in no event may the employer receive wage subsidies for more than 120 days of work in a consecutive 24-month period under one claim. An employer may continue to offer work pursuant to this subsection (4) after the worker has performed 120 days of work, but the employer shall not be eligible to receive wage subsidies for such work.(h) An employer shall not receive any wage subsidies or reimbursement of any expenses pursuant to this subsection (4) unless the employer has completed and submitted the reimbursement request on forms developed by the department, along with all related information required by department rules. No wage subsidy or reimbursement shall be paid to an employer who fails to submit a form for such payment within one year of the date the work was performed. In no event shall an employer receive wage subsidy payments or reimbursements of any expenses pursuant to this subsection (4) unless the worker's attending provider has restricted him or her from performing his or her usual work and the worker's attending provider has released him or her to perform the work offered.(i) Payments made under (b) through (g) of this subsection are subject to penalties under RCW 51.32.240(5) in cases where the funds were obtained through willful misrepresentation.(j) Once the worker returns to work under the terms of this subsection (4), he or she shall not be assigned by the employer to work other than the available work described without the worker's written consent, or without prior review and approval by the worker's attending provider. An employer who directs a claimant to perform work other than that approved by the attending provider and without the approval of the worker's attending provider shall not receive any wage subsidy or other reimbursements for such work.(k) If the worker returns to work under this subsection (4), any employee health and welfare benefits that the worker was receiving at the time of injury shall continue or be resumed at the level provided at the time of injury. Such benefits shall not be continued or resumed if to do so is inconsistent with the terms of the benefit program, or with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement currently in force.(l) In the event of any dispute as to the validity of the work offered or as to the worker's ability to perform the available work offered by the employer, the department shall make the final determination pursuant to an order that contains the notice required by RCW 51.52.060 and that is subject to appeal subject to RCW 51.52.050.(5) An employer's experience rating shall not be affected by the employer's request for or receipt of wage subsidies.(6) The department shall create a Washington stay-at-work account which shall be funded by assessments of employers insured through the state fund for the costs of the payments authorized by subsection (4) of this section, for the cost of creating a reserve for anticipated liabilities, and for costs authorized in RCW 51.32.095(2). Employers may collect up to one-half the fund assessment from workers.(7) No worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which injury was received or the three days following the same, unless his or her disability shall continue for a period of seven consecutive calendar days from date of injury: PROVIDED, That attempts to return to work in the first seven days following the injury shall not serve to break the continuity of the period of disability if the disability continues seven days after the injury occurs.(8) Should a worker suffer a temporary total disability and should his or her employer at the time of the injury continue to pay him or her the wages which he or she was earning at the time of such injury, such injured worker shall not receive any payment provided in subsection (1) of this section during the period his or her employer shall so pay such wages: PROVIDED, That holiday pay, vacation pay, sick leave, or other similar benefits shall not be deemed to be payments by the employer for the purposes of this subsection.(9) In no event shall the monthly payments provided in this section:(a) Exceed the applicable percentage of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018 as follows:AFTERPERCENTAGEJune 30, 1993105%June 30, 1994110%June 30, 1995115%June 30, 1996120%(b) For dates of injury or disease manifestation after July 1, 2008, be less than 15 percent of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under RCW 51.08.018 plus an additional $10 per month if the worker is married and an additional $10 per month for each child of the worker up to a maximum of five children. However, if the monthly payment computed under this subsection (9)(b) is greater than 100 percent of the wages of the worker as determined under RCW 51.08.178, the monthly payment due to the worker shall be equal to the greater of the monthly wages of the worker or the minimum benefit set forth in this section on June 30, 2008.(10) If the supervisor of industrial insurance determines that the worker is voluntarily retired and is no longer attached to the workforce, benefits shall not be paid under this section.(11) The department shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.\n\n(1) When the total disability is only temporary, the schedule of payments contained in *RCW 51.32.060 (1) and (2) shall apply, so long as the total disability continues.\n\n(2) Any compensation payable under this section for children not in the custody of the injured worker as of the date of injury shall be payable only to such person as actually is providing the support for such child or children pursuant to the order of a court of record providing for support of such child or children.\n\n(3)(a) As soon as recovery is so complete that the present earning power of the worker, at any kind of work, is restored to that existing at the time of the occurrence of the injury, the payments shall cease. If and so long as the present earning power is only partially restored, the payments shall:\n\n(i) For claims for injuries that occurred before May 7, 1993, continue in the proportion which the new earning power shall bear to the old; or\n\n(ii) For claims for injuries occurring on or after May 7, 1993, equal 80 percent of the actual difference between the worker's present wages and earning power at the time of injury, but: (A) The total of these payments and the worker's present wages may not exceed 150 percent of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under RCW 51.08.018; (B) the payments may not exceed 100 percent of the entitlement as computed under subsection (1) of this section; and (C) the payments may not be less than the worker would have received if (a)(i) of this subsection had been applicable to the worker's claim.\n\n(b) No compensation shall be payable under this subsection (3) unless the loss of earning power shall exceed five percent.\n\n(c) The prior closure of the claim or the receipt of permanent partial disability benefits shall not affect the rate at which loss of earning power benefits are calculated upon reopening the claim.\n\n(4)(a) The legislature finds that long-term disability and the cost of injuries is significantly reduced when injured workers remain at work following their injury. To encourage employers at the time of injury to provide light duty or transitional work for their workers, wage subsidies and other incentives are made available to employers insured with the department.\n\n(b) Whenever the employer of injury requests that a worker who is entitled to temporary total disability under this chapter be certified by the attending provider as able to perform available work other than his or her usual work, the employer shall furnish to the attending provider, with a copy to the worker, a statement describing the work available with the employer of injury in terms that will enable the attending provider to relate the activities of the job to the worker's disability. The attending provider shall then determine whether the worker is able to perform the work described. The worker's temporary total disability payments shall continue until the worker is released by his or her attending provider for the work, and begins the work with the employer of injury. If the work thereafter comes to an end before the worker's recovery is sufficient in the judgment of his or her attending provider to permit him or her to return to his or her usual job, or to perform other available work offered by the employer of injury, the worker's temporary total disability payments shall be resumed. Should the available work described, once undertaken by the worker, impede his or her recovery to the extent that in the judgment of his or her attending provider he or she should not continue to work, the worker's temporary total disability payments shall be resumed when the worker ceases such work.\n\n(c) To further encourage employers to maintain the employment of their injured workers, an employer insured with the department and that offers work to a worker pursuant to this subsection (4) shall be eligible for reimbursement of the injured worker's wages for light duty or transitional work equal to 50 percent of the basic, gross wages paid for that work, for a maximum of 120 workdays within a consecutive 24-month period. In no event may the wage subsidies paid to an employer on a claim exceed $25,000. Wage subsidies shall be calculated using the worker's basic hourly wages or basic salary, and no subsidy shall be paid for any other form of compensation or payment to the worker such as tips, commissions, bonuses, board, housing, fuel, health care, dental care, vision care, per diem, reimbursements for work-related expenses, or any other payments. An employer may not, under any circumstances, receive a wage subsidy for a day in which the worker did not actually perform any work, regardless of whether or not the employer paid the worker wages for that day.\n\n(d) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4) and the worker must be provided with training or instruction to be qualified to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for a reimbursement from the department for any tuition, books, fees, and materials required for that training or instruction, up to a maximum of $2,000. Reimbursing an employer for the costs of such training or instruction does not constitute a determination by the department that the worker is eligible for vocational services authorized by RCW 51.32.095.\n\n(e) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4), and the employer provides the worker with clothing that is necessary to allow the worker to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for reimbursement for such clothing from the department, up to a maximum of $1,000. However, an employer shall not receive reimbursement for any clothing it provided to the worker that it normally provides to its workers. The clothing purchased for the worker shall become the worker's property once the work comes to an end.\n\n(f) If an employer insured with the department offers a worker work pursuant to this subsection (4) and the worker must be provided with tools or equipment to perform the offered work, the employer shall be eligible for a reimbursement from the department for such tools and equipment and related costs as determined by department rule, up to a maximum of $5,000. An employer shall not be reimbursed for any tools or equipment purchased prior to offering the work to the worker pursuant to this subsection (4). An employer shall not be reimbursed for any tools or equipment that it normally provides to its workers. The tools and equipment shall be the property of the employer.\n\n(g) An employer may offer work to a worker pursuant to this subsection (4) more than once, but in no event may the employer receive wage subsidies for more than 120 days of work in a consecutive 24-month period under one claim. An employer may continue to offer work pursuant to this subsection (4) after the worker has performed 120 days of work, but the employer shall not be eligible to receive wage subsidies for such work.\n\n(h) An employer shall not receive any wage subsidies or reimbursement of any expenses pursuant to this subsection (4) unless the employer has completed and submitted the reimbursement request on forms developed by the department, along with all related information required by department rules. No wage subsidy or reimbursement shall be paid to an employer who fails to submit a form for such payment within one year of the date the work was performed. In no event shall an employer receive wage subsidy payments or reimbursements of any expenses pursuant to this subsection (4) unless the worker's attending provider has restricted him or her from performing his or her usual work and the worker's attending provider has released him or her to perform the work offered.\n\n(i) Payments made under (b) through (g) of this subsection are subject to penalties under RCW 51.32.240(5) in cases where the funds were obtained through willful misrepresentation.\n\n(j) Once the worker returns to work under the terms of this subsection (4), he or she shall not be assigned by the employer to work other than the available work described without the worker's written consent, or without prior review and approval by the worker's attending provider. An employer who directs a claimant to perform work other than that approved by the attending provider and without the approval of the worker's attending provider shall not receive any wage subsidy or other reimbursements for such work.\n\n(k) If the worker returns to work under this subsection (4), any employee health and welfare benefits that the worker was receiving at the time of injury shall continue or be resumed at the level provided at the time of injury. Such benefits shall not be continued or resumed if to do so is inconsistent with the terms of the benefit program, or with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement currently in force.\n\n(l) In the event of any dispute as to the validity of the work offered or as to the worker's ability to perform the available work offered by the employer, the department shall make the final determination pursuant to an order that contains the notice required by RCW 51.52.060 and that is subject to appeal subject to RCW 51.52.050.\n\n(5) An employer's experience rating shall not be affected by the employer's request for or receipt of wage subsidies.\n\n(6) The department shall create a Washington stay-at-work account which shall be funded by assessments of employers insured through the state fund for the costs of the payments authorized by subsection (4) of this section, for the cost of creating a reserve for anticipated liabilities, and for costs authorized in RCW 51.32.095(2). Employers may collect up to one-half the fund assessment from workers.\n\n(7) No worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which injury was received or the three days following the same, unless his or her disability shall continue for a period of seven consecutive calendar days from date of injury: PROVIDED, That attempts to return to work in the first seven days following the injury shall not serve to break the continuity of the period of disability if the disability continues seven days after the injury occurs.\n\n(8) Should a worker suffer a temporary total disability and should his or her employer at the time of the injury continue to pay him or her the wages which he or she was earning at the time of such injury, such injured worker shall not receive any payment provided in subsection (1) of this section during the period his or her employer shall so pay such wages: PROVIDED, That holiday pay, vacation pay, sick leave, or other similar benefits shall not be deemed to be payments by the employer for the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(9) In no event shall the monthly payments provided in this section:\n\n(a) Exceed the applicable percentage of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under the provisions of RCW 51.08.018 as follows:\n\nAFTERPERCENTAGEJune 30, 1993105%June 30, 1994110%June 30, 1995115%June 30, 1996120%\n\nJune 30, 1993\n\nJune 30, 1994\n\nJune 30, 1995\n\nJune 30, 1996\n\n(b) For dates of injury or disease manifestation after July 1, 2008, be less than 15 percent of the average monthly wage in the state as computed under RCW 51.08.018 plus an additional $10 per month if the worker is married and an additional $10 per month for each child of the worker up to a maximum of five children. However, if the monthly payment computed under this subsection (9)(b) is greater than 100 percent of the wages of the worker as determined under RCW 51.08.178, the monthly payment due to the worker shall be equal to the greater of the monthly wages of the worker or the minimum benefit set forth in this section on June 30, 2008.\n\n(10) If the supervisor of industrial insurance determines that the worker is voluntarily retired and is no longer attached to the workforce, benefits shall not be paid under this section.\n\n(11) The department shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.\n\n[ 2024 c 144 s 2; (2024 c 144 s 1 expired July 1, 2025); 2024 c 90 s 1; 2023 c 171 s 7; 2011 1st sp.s. c 37 s 101.

      "text": "RCW 51.32.095\n\nVocational rehabilitation services—Benefits—Priorities—Allowable costs—Performance criteria.\n\n(1) One of the primary purposes of this title is to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment. To this end, the department or self-insurers must utilize the services of individuals and organizations, public or private, whose experience, training, and interests in vocational rehabilitation and retraining qualify them to lend expert assistance to the supervisor of industrial insurance in such programs of vocational rehabilitation as may be reasonable to make the worker employable consistent with his or her physical and mental status. Where, after evaluation and recommendation by such individuals or organizations and prior to final evaluation of the worker's permanent disability and in the sole opinion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, whether or not medical treatment has been concluded, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment, the supervisor or supervisor's designee may, in his or her sole discretion, pay or, if the employer is a self-insurer, direct the self-insurer to pay the cost as provided in subsection (6) of this section as appropriate. An injured worker may not participate in vocational rehabilitation under this section if such participation would result in a payment of benefits as described in RCW 51.32.240(5), and any benefits so paid must be recovered according to the terms of that section.(2)(a) To help injured workers maintain and build labor market readiness skills during vocational services in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, funds may be payable to a department-approved training provider as defined by department rule, so that courses may be available for basic skills development.(b) Participation in basic skills development is optional for the worker.(c) Funds may pay for but are not limited to:(i) English language training;(ii) Basic computer literacy;(iii) General education development or high school equivalency training;(iv) Technology or software needed to effectively participate in basic skills development;(v) Tutoring for approved basic skills training;(vi) Other skills that prepare an injured worker for gainful employment.(d) Travel and accommodation expenses are not payable under (c) of this subsection.(e) These funds are available once per claim equal to 25 percent of the maximum funding available for vocational retraining defined in RCW 51.32.096(4)(d). Use of these funds for basic skills development does not reduce funds that are available for a formal retraining plan.(i) Funds must be paid directly to training providers or to vendors to procure necessary equipment or assistance, and may not be paid directly to the worker.(ii) Self-insured employers must pay for the costs of basic skills development for their injured workers independently from this fund.(f) Eligibility of training for this funding is based upon a recommendation from the assigned vocational rehabilitation counselor, and approval at the sole discretion of the supervisor of industrial insurance or their designee to ensure the proposed training is consistent with basic skills development as used in this section.(g) The injured worker's knowledge and skills gained through basic skills development may not be construed as acquisition of transferable skills under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and does not disqualify the injured worker from being found eligible for continued vocational rehabilitation services or retraining programs available under this title. Payment for the costs of basic skills training or instruction does not constitute a determination by the department that the worker is eligible for vocational services authorized by this section.(h) Injured workers may finish specific courses that were approved and paid in full prior to vocational referral closure or claim closure. Otherwise funding for this type of skills development ends when the vocational referral closes or the claim closes.(i) This funding is not associated in any way with eligibility for temporary total disability benefits or any vocational services.(j) A worker's eligibility for or participation in basic skills development does not preclude the employer of injury's right to offer work under RCW 51.32.090(4) or to offer work consistent with the priorities identified in subsection (3) of this section.(3) Vocational rehabilitation services may be provided to an injured worker when in the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable at gainful employment. In determining whether to provide vocational services and at what level, the following list must be used, in order of priority with the highest priority given to returning a worker to employment:(a) Return to the previous job with the same employer;(b) Modification of the previous job with the same employer including transitional return to work;(c) A new job with the same employer in keeping with any limitations or restrictions;(d) Modification of a new job with the same employer including transitional return to work;(e) Modification of the previous job with a new employer;(f) A new job with a new employer or self-employment based upon transferable skills;(g) Modification of a new job with a new employer;(h) A new job with a new employer or self-employment involving on-the-job training;(i) Short-term retraining.(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, vocational services may be provided to an injured worker who has suffered the loss or complete use of both legs, or arms, or one leg and one arm, or total eyesight when, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, these services will either substantially improve the worker's quality of life or substantially improve the worker's ability to function in an employment setting, regardless of whether or not these services are either necessary or reasonably likely to make the worker employable at any gainful employment. Vocational services must be completed prior to the commencement of the worker's entitlement to benefits under RCW 51.32.060. However, workers who are eligible for vocational services under this subsection are not eligible for option 2 benefits, as provided in RCW 51.32.096.(5) To encourage the employment of individuals who have suffered an injury or occupational disease resulting in permanent disability which may be a substantial obstacle to employment, the supervisor or supervisor's designee, in his or her sole discretion, may provide assistance including job placement services for eligible injured workers who are receiving vocational services under the return-to-work priorities listed in subsection (3)(b) through (i) of this section, except for self-employment, and to employers that employ them. The assistance listed in (a) through (f) of this subsection is only available in cases where the worker is employed:(a) Reduction or elimination of premiums or assessments owed by employers for such workers;(b) Reduction or elimination of charges against the employers in the event of further injury to such workers in their employ;(c) Reimbursement of the injured worker's wages for light duty or transitional work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(c);(d) Reimbursement for the costs of clothing that is necessary to allow the worker to perform the offered work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(e);(e) Reimbursement for the costs of tools or equipment to allow the worker to perform the work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(f);(f) A one-time payment of $25,000 for continuous employment without reduction in base wages for at least 12 months. The 12 months begin the first date of employment and the one-time payment is available at the sole discretion of the supervisor of industrial insurance;(g) The benefits described in this section are available to a state fund employer without regard to whether the worker was employed by the state fund employer at the time of injury. The benefits are available to a self-insured employer only in cases where the worker was employed by a state fund employer at the time of injury or occupational disease manifestation;(h) The benefits described in (a) through (f) of this subsection (5) are only available in instances where a department-employed vocational rehabilitation professional has determined that the worker has returned to work that is reasonably consistent with the worker's restrictions.(6)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, transportation, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses for any such worker in an amount not to exceed $3,000 in any 52 week period, and the cost of continuing the temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 while the worker is actively and successfully undergoing a formal program of vocational rehabilitation.(b) Beginning with vocational rehabilitation plans approved on or after July 1, 1999, through December 31, 2007, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses for any such worker in an amount not to exceed $4,000 in any 52 week period, and the cost of transportation and continuing the temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 while the worker is actively and successfully undergoing a formal program of vocational rehabilitation.(c) The expenses allowed under (a) or (b) of this subsection may include training fees for on-the-job training and the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self-employment or reemployment. However, compensation or payment of retraining with job placement expenses under (a) or (b) of this subsection may not be authorized for a period of more than 52 weeks, except that such period may, in the sole discretion of the supervisor after his or her review, be extended for an additional 52 weeks or portion thereof by written order of the supervisor.(d) In cases where the worker is required to reside away from his or her customary residence, the reasonable cost of board and lodging must also be paid.(e) Costs paid under this subsection must be chargeable to the employer's cost experience or must be paid by the self-insurer as the case may be.(7) In addition to the vocational rehabilitation expenditures provided for under subsection (6) of this section, an additional $10,000 may, upon authorization of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, be expended for: (a) Accommodations for an injured worker that are medically necessary for the worker to participate in an approved retraining plan; and (b) accommodations necessary to perform the essential functions of an occupation in which an injured worker is seeking employment, consistent with the retraining plan or the recommendations of a vocational evaluation. The injured worker's attending provider must verify the necessity of the modifications or accommodations. The total expenditures authorized in this subsection and the expenditures authorized under RCW 51.32.250 may not exceed $10,000.(8) When the department has approved a vocational plan for a worker prior to January 1, 2008, regardless of whether the worker has begun participating in the approved plan, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section are limited to those provided under subsections (6) and (7) of this section.(9) The department must establish criteria to monitor the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation services provided by the individuals and organizations. The state fund must make referrals for vocational rehabilitation services based on these performance criteria.(10) The department must engage in, where feasible and cost-effective, a cooperative program with the state employment security department to provide job placement services under this section including participation by the department as a partner with WorkSource and with the private vocational rehabilitation community to refer workers to these vocational professionals for job search and job placement assistance. As a partner, the department must place vocational professional full-time employees at selected WorkSource locations who will work with employers to market the benefits of on-the-job training programs and preferred worker financial incentives as described in subsection (5) of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, \"WorkSource\" means the established state system that administers the federal workforce investment act of 1998.(11) The benefits in this section and RCW 51.32.096 must be provided for the injured workers of self-insured employers. Self-insurers must report both benefits provided and benefits denied in the manner prescribed by the department by rule adopted under chapter 34.05 RCW. The director may, in his or her sole discretion and upon his or her own initiative or at any time that a dispute arises under this section or RCW 51.32.096, promptly make such inquiries as circumstances require and take such other action as he or she considers will properly determine the matter and protect the rights of the parties.(12) Except as otherwise provided, the benefits provided for in this section and RCW 51.32.096 are available to any otherwise eligible worker regardless of the date of industrial injury. However, claims may not be reopened solely for vocational rehabilitation purposes.\n\n(1) One of the primary purposes of this title is to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment. To this end, the department or self-insurers must utilize the services of individuals and organizations, public or private, whose experience, training, and interests in vocational rehabilitation and retraining qualify them to lend expert assistance to the supervisor of industrial insurance in such programs of vocational rehabilitation as may be reasonable to make the worker employable consistent with his or her physical and mental status. Where, after evaluation and recommendation by such individuals or organizations and prior to final evaluation of the worker's permanent disability and in the sole opinion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, whether or not medical treatment has been concluded, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment, the supervisor or supervisor's designee may, in his or her sole discretion, pay or, if the employer is a self-insurer, direct the self-insurer to pay the cost as provided in subsection (6) of this section as appropriate. An injured worker may not participate in vocational rehabilitation under this section if such participation would result in a payment of benefits as described in RCW 51.32.240(5), and any benefits so paid must be recovered according to the terms of that section.\n\n(2)(a) To help injured workers maintain and build labor market readiness skills during vocational services in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, funds may be payable to a department-approved training provider as defined by department rule, so that courses may be available for basic skills development.\n\n(b) Participation in basic skills development is optional for the worker.\n\n(c) Funds may pay for but are not limited to:\n\n(i) English language training;\n\n(ii) Basic computer literacy;\n\n(iii) General education development or high school equivalency training;\n\n(iv) Technology or software needed to effectively participate in basic skills development;\n\n(v) Tutoring for approved basic skills training;\n\n(vi) Other skills that prepare an injured worker for gainful employment.\n\n(d) Travel and accommodation expenses are not payable under (c) of this subsection.\n\n(e) These funds are available once per claim equal to 25 percent of the maximum funding available for vocational retraining defined in RCW 51.32.096(4)(d). Use of these funds for basic skills development does not reduce funds that are available for a formal retraining plan.\n\n(i) Funds must be paid directly to training providers or to vendors to procure necessary equipment or assistance, and may not be paid directly to the worker.\n\n(ii) Self-insured employers must pay for the costs of basic skills development for their injured workers independently from this fund.\n\n(f) Eligibility of training for this funding is based upon a recommendation from the assigned vocational rehabilitation counselor, and approval at the sole discretion of the supervisor of industrial insurance or their designee to ensure the proposed training is consistent with basic skills development as used in this section.\n\n(g) The injured worker's knowledge and skills gained through basic skills development may not be construed as acquisition of transferable skills under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and does not disqualify the injured worker from being found eligible for continued vocational rehabilitation services or retraining programs available under this title.

In determining whether to provide vocational services and at what level, the following list must be used, in order of priority with the highest priority given to returning a worker to employment:\n\n(a) Return to the previous job with the same employer;\n\n(b) Modification of the previous job with the same employer including transitional return to work;\n\n(c) A new job with the same employer in keeping with any limitations or restrictions;\n\n(d) Modification of a new job with the same employer including transitional return to work;\n\n(e) Modification of the previous job with a new employer;\n\n(f) A new job with a new employer or self-employment based upon transferable skills;\n\n(g) Modification of a new job with a new employer;\n\n(h) A new job with a new employer or self-employment involving on-the-job training;\n\n(i) Short-term retraining.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, vocational services may be provided to an injured worker who has suffered the loss or complete use of both legs, or arms, or one leg and one arm, or total eyesight when, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, these services will either substantially improve the worker's quality of life or substantially improve the worker's ability to function in an employment setting, regardless of whether or not these services are either necessary or reasonably likely to make the worker employable at any gainful employment. Vocational services must be completed prior to the commencement of the worker's entitlement to benefits under RCW 51.32.060. However, workers who are eligible for vocational services under this subsection are not eligible for option 2 benefits, as provided in RCW 51.32.096.\n\n(5) To encourage the employment of individuals who have suffered an injury or occupational disease resulting in permanent disability which may be a substantial obstacle to employment, the supervisor or supervisor's designee, in his or her sole discretion, may provide assistance including job placement services for eligible injured workers who are receiving vocational services under the return-to-work priorities listed in subsection (3)(b) through (i) of this section, except for self-employment, and to employers that employ them. The assistance listed in (a) through (f) of this subsection is only available in cases where the worker is employed:\n\n(a) Reduction or elimination of premiums or assessments owed by employers for such workers;\n\n(b) Reduction or elimination of charges against the employers in the event of further injury to such workers in their employ;\n\n(c) Reimbursement of the injured worker's wages for light duty or transitional work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(c);\n\n(d) Reimbursement for the costs of clothing that is necessary to allow the worker to perform the offered work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(e);\n\n(e) Reimbursement for the costs of tools or equipment to allow the worker to perform the work consistent with the limitations in RCW 51.32.090(4)(f);\n\n(f) A one-time payment of $25,000 for continuous employment without reduction in base wages for at least 12 months. The 12 months begin the first date of employment and the one-time payment is available at the sole discretion of the supervisor of industrial insurance;\n\n(g) The benefits described in this section are available to a state fund employer without regard to whether the worker was employed by the state fund employer at the time of injury. The benefits are available to a self-insured employer only in cases where the worker was employed by a state fund employer at the time of injury or occupational disease manifestation;\n\n(h) The benefits described in (a) through (f) of this subsection (5) are only available in instances where a department-employed vocational rehabilitation professional has determined that the worker has returned to work that is reasonably consistent with the worker's restrictions.\n\n(6)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, transportation, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses for any such worker in an amount not to exceed $3,000 in any 52 week period, and the cost of continuing the temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 while the worker is actively and successfully undergoing a formal program of vocational rehabilitation.\n\n(b) Beginning with vocational rehabilitation plans approved on or after July 1, 1999, through December 31, 2007, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses for any such worker in an amount not to exceed $4,000 in any 52 week period, and the cost of transportation and continuing the temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 while the worker is actively and successfully undergoing a formal program of vocational rehabilitation.\n\n(c) The expenses allowed under (a) or (b) of this subsection may include training fees for on-the-job training and the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self-employment or reemployment. However, compensation or payment of retraining with job placement expenses under (a) or (b) of this subsection may not be authorized for a period of more than 52 weeks, except that such period may, in the sole discretion of the supervisor after his or her review, be extended for an additional 52 weeks or portion thereof by written order of the supervisor.\n\n(d) In cases where the worker is required to reside away from his or her customary residence, the reasonable cost of board and lodging must also be paid.\n\n(e) Costs paid under this subsection must be chargeable to the employer's cost experience or must be paid by the self-insurer as the case may be.\n\n(7) In addition to the vocational rehabilitation expenditures provided for under subsection (6) of this section, an additional $10,000 may, upon authorization of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, be expended for: (a) Accommodations for an injured worker that are medically necessary for the worker to participate in an approved retraining plan; and (b) accommodations necessary to perform the essential functions of an occupation in which an injured worker is seeking employment, consistent with the retraining plan or the recommendations of a vocational evaluation. The injured worker's attending provider must verify the necessity of the modifications or accommodations. The total expenditures authorized in this subsection and the expenditures authorized under RCW 51.32.250 may not exceed $10,000.\n\n(8) When the department has approved a vocational plan for a worker prior to January 1, 2008, regardless of whether the worker has begun participating in the approved plan, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the supervisor or supervisor's designee under subsection (1) of this section are limited to those provided under subsections (6) and (7) of this section.\n\n(9) The department must establish criteria to monitor the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation services provided by the individuals and organizations. The state fund must make referrals for vocational rehabilitation services based on these performance criteria.\n\n(10) The department must engage in, where feasible and cost-effective, a cooperative program with the state employment security department to provide job placement services under this section including participation by the department as a partner with WorkSource and with the private vocational rehabilitation community to refer workers to these vocational professionals for job search and job placement assistance. As a partner, the department must place vocational professional full-time employees at selected WorkSource locations who will work with employers to market the benefits of on-the-job training programs and preferred worker financial incentives as described in subsection (5) of this section. For the purposes of this subsection, \"WorkSource\" means the established state system that administers the federal workforce investment act of 1998.\n\n(11) The benefits in this section and RCW 51.32.096 must be provided for the injured workers of self-insured employers. Self-insurers must report both benefits provided and benefits denied in the manner prescribed by the department by rule adopted under chapter 34.05 RCW. The director may, in his or her sole discretion and upon his or her own initiative or at any time that a dispute arises under this section or RCW 51.32.096, promptly make such inquiries as circumstances require and take such other action as he or she considers will properly determine the matter and protect the rights of the parties.\n\n(12) Except as otherwise provided, the benefits provided for in this section and RCW 51.32.096 are available to any otherwise eligible worker regardless of the date of industrial injury. However, claims may not be reopened solely for vocational rehabilitation purposes.\n\n[ 2024 c 90 s 2; 2023 c 171 s 8; 2018 c 22 s 13.

      "text": "RCW 51.32.096\n\nVocational rehabilitation benefits and options—Advisory committee—Procedures—Requirements—Definitions—Costs.\n\n(1) To continue the partnership of business and labor with regard to best practices in the provision of vocational services and to identify further improvements to Washington's vocational rehabilitation system and benefits, the director must appoint a vocational rehabilitation advisory committee to consist of at least one member representing employers insured by the state fund, one member representing self-insured employers, and two members representing workers. The appointments must be made from lists of nominations provided by statewide business, self-insured employers, and labor organizations.(2) Prior to or during plan development, the department may authorize payment for workers who choose to pursue basic skills development training, such as English as a second language and general equivalency degree courses.(3)(a) For the purposes of this section, the day the worker commences vocational plan development means the date the department or self-insurer notifies the worker of his or her eligibility for plan development services or of an eligibility determination in response to a dispute of a vocational decision.(b) When the supervisor or supervisor's designee has decided that vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable at gainful employment, he or she must be provided with services necessary to develop a vocational plan that, if completed, would render the worker employable. The vocational professional assigned to the claim must, at the initial meeting with the worker, fully inform the worker of the return-to-work priorities set forth in RCW 51.32.095(3) and of his or her rights and responsibilities under the workers' compensation vocational system. The department must provide tools to the vocational professional for communicating this and other information required by RCW 51.32.095 and this section to the worker.(c) On the date the worker commences vocational plan development, the department must also inform the employer in writing of the employer's right to make a valid return-to-work offer during the first 15 days following the commencement of vocational plan development. However, at the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, an employer may be granted an extension of time of up to 10 additional days to make a valid return-to-work offer. The additional days may be allowed by the department with or without a request from the employer. The extension may only be granted if the employer made a return-to-work offer to the worker within 15 days of the date the worker commenced vocational plan development that met some but not all of the requirements in this section. To be valid, the offer must be for bona fide employment with the employer of injury, consistent with the worker's documented physical and mental restrictions as provided by the worker's health care provider. When the employer makes a valid return-to-work offer, the vocational plan development services and temporary total disability compensation must be terminated effective on the starting date for the job without regard to whether the worker accepts the return-to-work offer.(d) Following the time period described in (c) of this subsection, the employer may still provide, and the worker may accept, any valid return-to-work offer. The worker's acceptance of such an offer must result in the termination of vocational plan development or implementation services and temporary total disability compensation effective the day the employment begins.(4)(a) All vocational plans must contain an accountability agreement signed by the worker detailing expectations regarding progress, attendance, and other factors influencing successful participation in the plan. Failure to abide by the agreed expectations must result in suspension of vocational benefits pursuant to RCW 51.32.110, including the opportunity for the worker to demonstrate good cause.(b) Any formal education included as part of the vocational plan must be for an accredited or licensed program or other program approved by the department. The department must develop rules that provide criteria for the approval of nonaccredited or unlicensed programs.(c) The vocational plan for an individual worker must be completed and submitted to the department within 90 days of the day the worker commences vocational plan development. The department may extend the 90 days for good cause. Criteria for good cause must be provided in rule.(d) Costs for the vocational plan may include books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, child or dependent care, training fees for on-the-job training, the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self-employment or reemployment, and other necessary expenses in an amount not to exceed $17,500. This amount must be adjusted effective July 1st of each year for vocational plans or retraining benefits available under subsection (5)(b) of this section approved on or after this date but before June 30th of the next year based on the average percentage change in tuition for the next fall quarter for all Washington state community colleges. Effective July 1, 2016, and each July 1st thereafter, the increase cannot exceed two percent per year, unless the amount available would be less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college training plan. Effective July 1st following the calendar year in which the amount available is less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college plan, costs for newly approved plans can be up to 150 percent of this community college plan average. The average cost of two-year community college training plans will be calculated by the department based on plans completed during the preceding calendar year.(e) The duration of the vocational plan may not exceed two years from the date the plan is implemented. The worker must receive temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 and the cost of transportation while he or she is actively and successfully participating in a vocational plan.(f) If the worker is required to reside away from his or her customary residence, the reasonable cost of board and lodging must also be paid.(5) Except as provided in RCW 51.32.095(4), during vocational plan development the worker must, with the assistance of a vocational professional, participate in vocational counseling and occupational exploration to include, but not be limited to, identifying possible job goals, training needs, resources, and expenses, consistent with the worker's physical and mental status. A vocational rehabilitation plan must be developed by the worker and the vocational professional and submitted to the department or self-insurer. Following this submission, the worker must elect one of the following options:(a) Option 1: The department or self-insurer implements and the worker participates in the vocational plan developed by the vocational professional and approved by the worker and the department or self-insurer. For state fund claims, the department must review and approve the vocational plan before implementation may begin. If the department takes no action within 15 days, the plan is deemed approved. Beginning the date the department approves the plan, or the date of a determination that the plan is valid following a dispute, through completion of the first academic quarter or three months' training, the worker may elect option 2. However, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, the department may approve an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted in writing within 25 days of the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training if the worker provides a written explanation establishing that he or she was unable to submit his or her election of option 2 benefits within 15 days. In no circumstance may the department approve of an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted more than 25 days after the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training.(i) Following successful completion of the vocational plan, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) must include consideration of transferable skills obtained in the vocational plan.(ii) If a vocational plan is successfully completed on a claim which is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost and duration available for any subsequent vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section, less that previously expended.(b) Option 2: The worker declines further vocational services under the claim and receives an amount equal to nine months of temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090. The award must be reduced by the amount of any temporary total disability compensation paid for days starting with the first day of the academic quarter or three months' training and for any days through the date the department received the worker's written election of option 2. The award is payable in biweekly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments, until such award is paid in full. These payments may not include interest on the unpaid balance. However, upon application by the worker, and at the discretion of the department, the compensation may be converted to a lump sum payment. The vocational costs defined in subsection (4)(d) of this section must remain available to the worker less any amount expended for the worker's participation in the first academic quarter or three months' training, upon application to the department or self-insurer, for a period of five years. The vocational costs must, if expended, be available for programs or courses at any accredited or licensed institution or program from a list of those approved by the department for tuition, books, fees, supplies, equipment, and tools, without department or self-insurer oversight. Up to 10 percent of the total funds available to the worker can be used for vocational counseling and job placement services. The department must issue an order as provided in RCW 51.52.050 confirming the option 2 election, setting a payment schedule, and terminating temporary total disability benefits effective the date of the order confirming that election. The department must thereafter close the claim. A worker who elects option 2 benefits is not entitled to further temporary total, or to permanent total, disability benefits except upon a showing of a worsening in the condition or conditions accepted under the claim such that claim closure is not appropriate, in which case the option 2 selection must be rescinded and the amount paid to the worker must be assessed as an overpayment. A claim that was closed based on the worker's election of option 2 benefits may be reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, but cannot be reopened for the sole purpose of allowing the worker to seek vocational assistance.(i) If, within five years from the date the option 2 order becomes final, the worker is subsequently injured or suffers an occupational disease or reopens the claim as provided in RCW 51.32.160, and vocational rehabilitation is found both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1), the duration of any vocational plan under subsection (4)(e) of this section may not exceed 15 months.(ii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) must include consideration of the transferable skills obtained.(iii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker and the claim is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost available for any vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) of this section less that previously expended.(iv) Option 2 may only be elected once per worker.(c) The director, in his or her sole discretion, may provide the worker vocational assistance not to exceed that in subsection (4) of this section, without regard to the worker's prior option selection or benefits expended, where vocational assistance would prevent permanent total disability under RCW 51.32.060.(6)(a) \"Vocational plan interruption\" for the purposes of this section means an occurrence which disrupts the plan to the extent the employability goal is no longer attainable. \"Vocational plan interruption\" does not include institutionally scheduled breaks in educational programs, occasional absence due to illness, or modifications to the plan which will allow it to be completed within the cost and time provisions of subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section.(b) When a vocational plan interruption is beyond the control of the worker, the department or self-insurer must recommence plan development. If necessary to complete vocational services, the cost and duration of the plan may include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered outside the control of the worker when it is due to the closure of the accredited institution, when it is due to a death in the worker's immediate family, or when documented changes in the worker's accepted medical conditions prevent further participation in the vocational plan.(c) When a vocational plan interruption is the result of the worker's actions, the worker's entitlement to benefits must be suspended in accordance with RCW 51.32.110, including the opportunity for the worker to demonstrate good cause. If plan development or implementation is recommenced, the cost and duration of the plan may not include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered a result of the worker's actions when it is due to the failure to meet attendance expectations set by the training or educational institution, failure to achieve passing grades or acceptable performance review, unaccepted or postinjury conditions that prevent further participation in the vocational plan, or the worker's failure to abide by the accountability agreement in subsection (4)(a) of this section.(7) Costs paid for vocational services and plans must be chargeable to the employer's cost experience or must be paid by the self-insurer, as the case may be. For state fund vocational plans implemented on or after January 1, 2008, the costs may be paid from the medical aid fund at the sole discretion of the director under the following circumstances:(a) The worker previously participated in a vocational plan or selected a worker option as described in subsection (5) of this section;(b) The worker's prior vocational plan or selected option was based on an approved plan or option on or after January 1, 2008;(c) For state fund employers, the date of injury or disease manifestation of the subsequent claim is within the period of time used to calculate their experience factor;(d) The subsequent claim is for an injury or occupational disease that resulted from employment and work-related activities beyond the worker's documented restrictions.(8) The vocational plan costs payable from the medical aid fund must include the costs of temporary total disability benefits, except those payable from the supplemental pension fund, from the date the vocational plan is implemented to the date the worker completes the plan or ceases participation. The vocational costs paid from the medical aid fund may not be charged to the state fund employer's cost experience.\n\n(1) To continue the partnership of business and labor with regard to best practices in the provision of vocational services and to identify further improvements to Washington's vocational rehabilitation system and benefits, the director must appoint a vocational rehabilitation advisory committee to consist of at least one member representing employers insured by the state fund, one member representing self-insured employers, and two members representing workers. The appointments must be made from lists of nominations provided by statewide business, self-insured employers, and labor organizations.\n\n(2) Prior to or during plan development, the department may authorize payment for workers who choose to pursue basic skills development training, such as English as a second language and general equivalency degree courses.\n\n(3)(a) For the purposes of this section, the day the worker commences vocational plan development means the date the department or self-insurer notifies the worker of his or her eligibility for plan development services or of an eligibility determination in response to a dispute of a vocational decision.\n\n(b) When the supervisor or supervisor's designee has decided that vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable at gainful employment, he or she must be provided with services necessary to develop a vocational plan that, if completed, would render the worker employable. The vocational professional assigned to the claim must, at the initial meeting with the worker, fully inform the worker of the return-to-work priorities set forth in RCW 51.32.095(3) and of his or her rights and responsibilities under the workers' compensation vocational system. The department must provide tools to the vocational professional for communicating this and other information required by RCW 51.32.095 and this section to the worker.\n\n(c) On the date the worker commences vocational plan development, the department must also inform the employer in writing of the employer's right to make a valid return-to-work offer during the first 15 days following the commencement of vocational plan development. However, at the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, an employer may be granted an extension of time of up to 10 additional days to make a valid return-to-work offer. The additional days may be allowed by the department with or without a request from the employer. The extension may only be granted if the employer made a return-to-work offer to the worker within 15 days of the date the worker commenced vocational plan development that met some but not all of the requirements in this section. To be valid, the offer must be for bona fide employment with the employer of injury, consistent with the worker's documented physical and mental restrictions as provided by the worker's health care provider. When the employer makes a valid return-to-work offer, the vocational plan development services and temporary total disability compensation must be terminated effective on the starting date for the job without regard to whether the worker accepts the return-to-work offer.\n\n(d) Following the time period described in (c) of this subsection, the employer may still provide, and the worker may accept, any valid return-to-work offer. The worker's acceptance of such an offer must result in the termination of vocational plan development or implementation services and temporary total disability compensation effective the day the employment begins.\n\n(4)(a) All vocational plans must contain an accountability agreement signed by the worker detailing expectations regarding progress, attendance, and other factors influencing successful participation in the plan. Failure to abide by the agreed expectations must result in suspension of vocational benefits pursuant to RCW 51.32.110, including the opportunity for the worker to demonstrate good cause.\n\n(b) Any formal education included as part of the vocational plan must be for an accredited or licensed program or other program approved by the department. The department must develop rules that provide criteria for the approval of nonaccredited or unlicensed programs.\n\n(c) The vocational plan for an individual worker must be completed and submitted to the department within 90 days of the day the worker commences vocational plan development. The department may extend the 90 days for good cause. Criteria for good cause must be provided in rule.\n\n(d) Costs for the vocational plan may include books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, child or dependent care, training fees for on-the-job training, the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self-employment or reemployment, and other necessary expenses in an amount not to exceed $17,500. This amount must be adjusted effective July 1st of each year for vocational plans or retraining benefits available under subsection (5)(b) of this section approved on or after this date but before June 30th of the next year based on the average percentage change in tuition for the next fall quarter for all Washington state community colleges. Effective July 1, 2016, and each July 1st thereafter, the increase cannot exceed two percent per year, unless the amount available would be less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college training plan. Effective July 1st following the calendar year in which the amount available is less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college plan, costs for newly approved plans can be up to 150 percent of this community college plan average. The average cost of two-year community college training plans will be calculated by the department based on plans completed during the preceding calendar year.\n\n(e) The duration of the vocational plan may not exceed two years from the date the plan is implemented. The worker must receive temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090 and the cost of transportation while he or she is actively and successfully participating in a vocational plan.\n\n(f) If the worker is required to reside away from his or her customary residence, the reasonable cost of board and lodging must also be paid.\n\n(5) Except as provided in RCW 51.32.095(4), during vocational plan development the worker must, with the assistance of a vocational professional, participate in vocational counseling and occupational exploration to include, but not be limited to, identifying possible job goals, training needs, resources, and expenses, consistent with the worker's physical and mental status. A vocational rehabilitation plan must be developed by the worker and the vocational professional and submitted to the department or self-insurer. Following this submission, the worker must elect one of the following options:\n\n(a) Option 1: The department or self-insurer implements and the worker participates in the vocational plan developed by the vocational professional and approved by the worker and the department or self-insurer. For state fund claims, the department must review and approve the vocational plan before implementation may begin. If the department takes no action within 15 days, the plan is deemed approved. Beginning the date the department approves the plan, or the date of a determination that the plan is valid following a dispute, through completion of the first academic quarter or three months' training, the worker may elect option 2. However, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, the department may approve an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted in writing within 25 days of the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training if the worker provides a written explanation establishing that he or she was unable to submit his or her election of option 2 benefits within 15 days. In no circumstance may the department approve of an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted more than 25 days after the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training.\n\n(i) Following successful completion of the vocational plan, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) must include consideration of transferable skills obtained in the vocational plan.\n\n(ii) If a vocational plan is successfully completed on a claim which is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost and duration available for any subsequent vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section, less that previously expended.\n\n(b) Option 2: The worker declines further vocational services under the claim and receives an amount equal to nine months of temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090. The award must be reduced by the amount of any temporary total disability compensation paid for days starting with the first day of the academic quarter or three months' training and for any days through the date the department received the worker's written election of option 2. The award is payable in biweekly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments, until such award is paid in full. These payments may not include interest on the unpaid balance. However, upon application by the worker, and at the discretion of the department, the compensation may be converted to a lump sum payment. The vocational costs defined in subsection (4)(d) of this section must remain available to the worker less any amount expended for the worker's participation in the first academic quarter or three months' training, upon application to the department or self-insurer, for a period of five years. The vocational costs must, if expended, be available for programs or courses at any accredited or licensed institution or program from a list of those approved by the department for tuition, books, fees, supplies, equipment, and tools, without department or self-insurer oversight. Up to 10 percent of the total funds available to the worker can be used for vocational counseling and job placement services. The department must issue an order as provided in RCW 51.52.050 confirming the option 2 election, setting a payment schedule, and terminating temporary total disability benefits effective the date of the order confirming that election. The department must thereafter close the claim. A worker who elects option 2 benefits is not entitled to further temporary total, or to permanent total, disability benefits except upon a showing of a worsening in the condition or conditions accepted under the claim such that claim closure is not appropriate, in which case the option 2 selection must be rescinded and the amount paid to the worker must be assessed as an overpayment. A claim that was closed based on the worker's election of option 2 benefits may be reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, but cannot be reopened for the sole purpose of allowing the worker to seek vocational assistance.\n\n(i) If, within five years from the date the option 2 order becomes final, the worker is subsequently injured or suffers an occupational disease or reopens the claim as provided in RCW 51.32.160, and vocational rehabilitation is found both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1), the duration of any vocational plan under subsection (4)(e) of this section may not exceed 15 months.\n\n(ii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW 51.32.095(1) must include consideration of the transferable skills obtained.\n\n(iii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker and the claim is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW 51.32.160, the cost available for any vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) of this section less that previously expended.\n\n(iv) Option 2 may only be elected once per worker.\n\n(c) The director, in his or her sole discretion, may provide the worker vocational assistance not to exceed that in subsection (4) of this section, without regard to the worker's prior option selection or benefits expended, where vocational assistance would prevent permanent total disability under RCW 51.32.060.\n\n(6)(a) \"Vocational plan interruption\" for the purposes of this section means an occurrence which disrupts the plan to the extent the employability goal is no longer attainable. \"Vocational plan interruption\" does not include institutionally scheduled breaks in educational programs, occasional absence due to illness, or modifications to the plan which will allow it to be completed within the cost and time provisions of subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section.\n\n(b) When a vocational plan interruption is beyond the control of the worker, the department or self-insurer must recommence plan development. If necessary to complete vocational services, the cost and duration of the plan may include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered outside the control of the worker when it is due to the closure of the accredited institution, when it is due to a death in the worker's immediate family, or when documented changes in the worker's accepted medical conditions prevent further participation in the vocational plan.\n\n(c) When a vocational plan interruption is the result of the worker's actions, the worker's entitlement to benefits must be suspended in accordance with RCW 51.32.110, including the opportunity for the worker to demonstrate good cause. If plan development or implementation is recommenced, the cost and duration of the plan may not include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered a result of the worker's actions when it is due to the failure to meet attendance expectations set by the training or educational institution, failure to achieve passing grades or acceptable performance review, unaccepted or postinjury conditions that prevent further participation in the vocational plan, or the worker's failure to abide by the accountability agreement in subsection (4)(a) of this section.\n\n(7) Costs paid for vocational services and plans must be chargeable to the employer's cost experience or must be paid by the self-insurer, as the case may be. For state fund vocational plans implemented on or after January 1, 2008, the costs may be paid from the medical aid fund at the sole discretion of the director under the following circumstances:\n\n(a) The worker previously participated in a vocational plan or selected a worker option as described in subsection (5) of this section;\n\n(b) The worker's prior vocational plan or selected option was based on an approved plan or option on or after January 1, 2008;\n\n(c) For state fund employers, the date of injury or disease manifestation of the subsequent claim is within the period of time used to calculate their experience factor;\n\n(d) The subsequent claim is for an injury or occupational disease that resulted from employment and work-related activities beyond the worker's documented restrictions.\n\n(8) The vocational plan costs payable from the medical aid fund must include the costs of temporary total disability benefits, except those payable from the supplemental pension fund, from the date the vocational plan is implemented to the date the worker completes the plan or ceases participation. The vocational costs paid from the medical aid fund may not be charged to the state fund employer's cost experience.\n\n[ 2024 c 90 s 3; 2015 c 137 s 5.]\n\nEffective date—2024 c 90: See note following RCW 51.32.090.\n\nEffective date—2024 c 90: See note following RCW 51.32.090.\n\nApplication—2015 c 137 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act applies to all claims commencing vocational plan development on or after July 31, 2015, without regard to the date of injury or occupational disease manifestation.\" [ 2015 c 137 s 10.]\n\nApplication—2015 c 137 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act applies to all claims commencing vocational plan development on or after July 31, 2015, without regard to the date of injury or occupational disease manifestation.\" [ 2015 c 137 s 10.]\n\nRules—2015 c 137: \"The department of labor and industries is authorized to establish and adopt rules governing the eligibility for and administration of benefits available under RCW 51.16.120, 51.32.095, * 51.32.099, 51.44.040, and 51.32.096.\" [ 2015 c 137 s 7.]\n\nRules—2015 c 137: \"The department of labor and industries is authorized to establish and adopt rules governing the eligibility for and administration of benefits available under RCW 51.16.120, 51.32.095, * 51.32.099, 51.44.040, and 51.32.096.\" [ 2015 c 137 s 7.]\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 51.32.099 expired June 30, 2016, pursuant to 2023 c 470 s 3001.\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 51.32.099 expired June 30, 2016, pursuant to 2023 c 470 s 3001.",

The department or self-insurer, as the case may be, must make claim for such repayment or recoupment within one year of the making of any such payment or it will be deemed any claim therefor has been waived.(b) Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section, the department may only assess an overpayment of benefits because of adjudicator error when the order upon which the overpayment is based is not yet final as provided in RCW 51.52.050 and 51.52.060. \"Adjudicator error\" includes the failure to consider information in the claim file, failure to secure adequate information, or an error in judgment.(c) The director, pursuant to rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise his or her discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such timely claim where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience.(2) Whenever the department or self-insurer fails to pay benefits because of clerical error, mistake of identity, or innocent misrepresentation, all not induced by recipient willful misrepresentation, the recipient may request an adjustment of benefits to be paid from the state fund or by the self-insurer, as the case may be, subject to the following:(a) The recipient must request an adjustment in benefits within one year from the date of the incorrect payment or it will be deemed any claim therefore has been waived.(b) The recipient may not seek an adjustment of benefits because of adjudicator error. Adjustments due to adjudicator error are addressed by the filing of a written request for reconsideration with the department of labor and industries or an appeal with the board of industrial insurance appeals within sixty days from the date the order is communicated as provided in RCW 51.52.050. \"Adjudicator error\" includes the failure to consider information in the claim file, failure to secure adequate information, or an error in judgment.(3) Whenever the department issues an order rejecting a claim for benefits paid pursuant to RCW 51.32.190 or 51.32.210, after payment for temporary disability benefits has been paid by a self-insurer pursuant to RCW 51.32.190(3) or by the department pursuant to RCW 51.32.210, the recipient thereof shall repay such benefits and recoupment may be made from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim with the state fund or self-insurer, as the case may be. The director, under rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such payments where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience.(4) Whenever any payment of benefits under this title has been made pursuant to an adjudication by the department or by order of the board or any court and timely appeal therefrom has been made where the final decision is that any such payment was made pursuant to an erroneous adjudication, the recipient thereof shall repay it and recoupment may be made from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim whether state fund or self-insured.(a) The director, pursuant to rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such payments where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the director waives in whole or in part any such payments due a self-insurer, the self-insurer shall be reimbursed the amount waived from the self-insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund.(b) The department shall collect information regarding self-insured claim overpayments resulting from final decisions of the board and the courts, and recoup such overpayments on behalf of the self-insurer from any open, new, or reopened state fund or self-insured claims. The department shall forward the amounts collected to the self-insurer to whom the payment is owed. The department may provide information as needed to any self-insurers from whom payments may be collected on behalf of the department or another self-insurer. Notwithstanding RCW 51.32.040, any self-insurer requested by the department to forward payments to the department pursuant to this subsection shall pay the department directly. The department shall credit the amounts recovered to the appropriate fund, or forward amounts collected to the appropriate self-insurer, as the case may be.(c) If a self-insurer is not fully reimbursed within twenty-four months of the first attempt at recovery through the collection process pursuant to this subsection and by means of processes pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the self-insurer shall be reimbursed for the remainder of the amount due from the self-insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund.(d) For purposes of this subsection, \"recipient\" does not include health service providers whose treatment or services were authorized by the department or self-insurer.(e) The department or self-insurer shall first attempt recovery of overpayments for health services from any entity that provided health insurance to the worker to the extent that the health insurance entity would have provided health insurance benefits but for workers' compensation coverage.(5)(a) Whenever any payment of benefits under this title has been induced by willful misrepresentation the recipient thereof shall repay any such payment together with a penalty of fifty percent of the total of any such payments and the amount of such total sum may be recouped from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim with the state fund or self-insurer against whom the willful misrepresentation was committed, as the case may be, and the amount of such penalty shall be placed in the supplemental pension fund. Such repayment or recoupment must be demanded or ordered within three years of the discovery of the willful misrepresentation.(b) For purposes of this subsection (5), it is willful misrepresentation for a person to obtain payments or other benefits under this title in an amount greater than that to which the person otherwise would be entitled. Willful misrepresentation includes:(i) Willful false statement; or(ii) Willful misrepresentation, omission, or concealment of any material fact.(c) For purposes of this subsection (5), \"willful\" means a conscious or deliberate false statement, misrepresentation, omission, or concealment of a material fact with the specific intent of obtaining, continuing, or increasing benefits under this title.(d) For purposes of this subsection (5), failure to disclose a work-type activity must be willful in order for a misrepresentation to have occurred.(e) For purposes of this subsection (5), a material fact is one which would result in additional, increased, or continued benefits, including but not limited to facts about physical restrictions, or work-type activities which either result in wages or income or would be reasonably expected to do so. Wages or income include the receipt of any goods or services. For a work-type activity to be reasonably expected to result in wages or income, a pattern of repeated activity must exist. For those activities that would reasonably be expected to result in wages or produce income, but for which actual wage or income information cannot be reasonably determined, the department shall impute wages pursuant to RCW 51.08.178(4).(6) The worker, beneficiary, or other person affected thereby shall have the right to contest an order assessing an overpayment pursuant to this section in the same manner and to the same extent as provided under RCW 51.52.050 and 51.52.060. In the event such an order becomes final under chapter 51.52 RCW and notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) through (5) of this section, the director, director's designee, or self-insurer may file with the clerk in any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the sum representing the unpaid overpayment and/or penalty plus interest accruing from the date the order became final. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for such warrant and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the worker, beneficiary, or other person mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the unpaid overpayment and/or penalty plus interest accrued, and the date the warrant was filed. The amount of the warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in all real and personal property of the worker, beneficiary, or other person against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed in the office of such clerk. The sheriff shall then proceed in the same manner and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in the superior court. Such warrant so docketed shall be sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the department or self-insurer in the manner provided by law in the case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court shall be entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10), which shall be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of such warrant shall be mailed to the worker, beneficiary, or other person within three days of filing with the clerk.The director, director's designee, or self-insurer may issue to any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, a notice to withhold and deliver property of any kind if there is reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, property that is due, owing, or belonging to any worker, beneficiary, or other person upon whom a warrant has been served for payments due the department or self-insurer. The notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be served by a method for which receipt can be confirmed or tracked accompanied by an affidavit of service by mailing or served by the sheriff of the county, or by the sheriff's deputy, or by any authorized representative of the director, director's designee, or self-insurer. Any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the notice within twenty days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired or in the notice and order to withhold and deliver. In the event there is in the possession of the party named and served with such notice and order, any property that may be subject to the claim of the department or self-insurer, such property shall be delivered forthwith to the director, the director's authorized representative, or self-insurer upon demand. If the party served and named in the notice and order fails to answer the notice and order within the time prescribed in this section, the court may, after the time to answer such order has expired, render judgment by default against the party named in the notice for the full amount, plus costs, claimed by the director, director's designee, or self-insurer in the notice. In the event that a notice to withhold and deliver is served upon an employer and the property found to be subject thereto is wages, the employer may assert in the answer all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the wage earner may be entitled.This subsection shall only apply to orders assessing an overpayment which are issued on or after July 28, 1991: PROVIDED, That this subsection shall apply retroactively to all orders assessing an overpayment resulting from fraud, civil or criminal.(7) Orders assessing an overpayment which are issued on or after July 28, 1991, shall include a conspicuous notice of the collection methods available to the department or self-insurer.\n\n(1)(a) Whenever any payment of benefits under this title is made because of clerical error, mistake of identity, innocent misrepresentation by or on behalf of the recipient thereof mistakenly acted upon, or any other circumstance of a similar nature, all not induced by willful misrepresentation, the recipient thereof shall repay it and recoupment may be made from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim with the state fund or self-insurer, as the case may be. The department or self-insurer, as the case may be, must make claim for such repayment or recoupment within one year of the making of any such payment or it will be deemed any claim therefor has been waived.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section, the department may only assess an overpayment of benefits because of adjudicator error when the order upon which the overpayment is based is not yet final as provided in RCW 51.52.050 and 51.52.060. \"Adjudicator error\" includes the failure to consider information in the claim file, failure to secure adequate information, or an error in judgment.\n\n(c) The director, pursuant to rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise his or her discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such timely claim where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\n\n(2) Whenever the department or self-insurer fails to pay benefits because of clerical error, mistake of identity, or innocent misrepresentation, all not induced by recipient willful misrepresentation, the recipient may request an adjustment of benefits to be paid from the state fund or by the self-insurer, as the case may be, subject to the following:\n\n(a) The recipient must request an adjustment in benefits within one year from the date of the incorrect payment or it will be deemed any claim therefore has been waived.\n\n(b) The recipient may not seek an adjustment of benefits because of adjudicator error. Adjustments due to adjudicator error are addressed by the filing of a written request for reconsideration with the department of labor and industries or an appeal with the board of industrial insurance appeals within sixty days from the date the order is communicated as provided in RCW 51.52.050. \"Adjudicator error\" includes the failure to consider information in the claim file, failure to secure adequate information, or an error in judgment.\n\n(3) Whenever the department issues an order rejecting a claim for benefits paid pursuant to RCW 51.32.190 or 51.32.210, after payment for temporary disability benefits has been paid by a self-insurer pursuant to RCW 51.32.190(3) or by the department pursuant to RCW 51.32.210, the recipient thereof shall repay such benefits and recoupment may be made from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim with the state fund or self-insurer, as the case may be. The director, under rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such payments where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\n\n(4) Whenever any payment of benefits under this title has been made pursuant to an adjudication by the department or by order of the board or any court and timely appeal therefrom has been made where the final decision is that any such payment was made pursuant to an erroneous adjudication, the recipient thereof shall repay it and recoupment may be made from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim whether state fund or self-insured.\n\n(a) The director, pursuant to rules adopted in accordance with the procedures provided in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, may exercise discretion to waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such payments where the recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the director waives in whole or in part any such payments due a self-insurer, the self-insurer shall be reimbursed the amount waived from the self-insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund.\n\n(b) The department shall collect information regarding self-insured claim overpayments resulting from final decisions of the board and the courts, and recoup such overpayments on behalf of the self-insurer from any open, new, or reopened state fund or self-insured claims. The department shall forward the amounts collected to the self-insurer to whom the payment is owed. The department may provide information as needed to any self-insurers from whom payments may be collected on behalf of the department or another self-insurer. Notwithstanding RCW 51.32.040, any self-insurer requested by the department to forward payments to the department pursuant to this subsection shall pay the department directly. The department shall credit the amounts recovered to the appropriate fund, or forward amounts collected to the appropriate self-insurer, as the case may be.\n\n(c) If a self-insurer is not fully reimbursed within twenty-four months of the first attempt at recovery through the collection process pursuant to this subsection and by means of processes pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the self-insurer shall be reimbursed for the remainder of the amount due from the self-insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subsection, \"recipient\" does not include health service providers whose treatment or services were authorized by the department or self-insurer.\n\n(e) The department or self-insurer shall first attempt recovery of overpayments for health services from any entity that provided health insurance to the worker to the extent that the health insurance entity would have provided health insurance benefits but for workers' compensation coverage.\n\n(5)(a) Whenever any payment of benefits under this title has been induced by willful misrepresentation the recipient thereof shall repay any such payment together with a penalty of fifty percent of the total of any such payments and the amount of such total sum may be recouped from any future payments due to the recipient on any claim with the state fund or self-insurer against whom the willful misrepresentation was committed, as the case may be, and the amount of such penalty shall be placed in the supplemental pension fund. Such repayment or recoupment must be demanded or ordered within three years of the discovery of the willful misrepresentation.\n\n(b) For purposes of this subsection (5), it is willful misrepresentation for a person to obtain payments or other benefits under this title in an amount greater than that to which the person otherwise would be entitled. Willful misrepresentation includes:\n\n(i) Willful false statement; or\n\n(ii) Willful misrepresentation, omission, or concealment of any material fact.\n\n(c) For purposes of this subsection (5), \"willful\" means a conscious or deliberate false statement, misrepresentation, omission, or concealment of a material fact with the specific intent of obtaining, continuing, or increasing benefits under this title.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subsection (5), failure to disclose a work-type activity must be willful in order for a misrepresentation to have occurred.\n\n(e) For purposes of this subsection (5), a material fact is one which would result in additional, increased, or continued benefits, including but not limited to facts about physical restrictions, or work-type activities which either result in wages or income or would be reasonably expected to do so. Wages or income include the receipt of any goods or services. For a work-type activity to be reasonably expected to result in wages or income, a pattern of repeated activity must exist. For those activities that would reasonably be expected to result in wages or produce income, but for which actual wage or income information cannot be reasonably determined, the department shall impute wages pursuant to RCW 51.08.178(4).\n\n(6) The worker, beneficiary, or other person affected thereby shall have the right to contest an order assessing an overpayment pursuant to this section in the same manner and to the same extent as provided under RCW 51.52.050 and 51.52.060. In the event such an order becomes final under chapter 51.52 RCW and notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) through (5) of this section, the director, director's designee, or self-insurer may file with the clerk in any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the sum representing the unpaid overpayment and/or penalty plus interest accruing from the date the order became final. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for such warrant and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the worker, beneficiary, or other person mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the unpaid overpayment and/or penalty plus interest accrued, and the date the warrant was filed. The amount of the warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in all real and personal property of the worker, beneficiary, or other person against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed in the office of such clerk. The sheriff shall then proceed in the same manner and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in the superior court. Such warrant so docketed shall be sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the department or self-insurer in the manner provided by law in the case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court shall be entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10), which shall be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of such warrant shall be mailed to the worker, beneficiary, or other person within three days of filing with the clerk.\n\nThe director, director's designee, or self-insurer may issue to any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, a notice to withhold and deliver property of any kind if there is reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, property that is due, owing, or belonging to any worker, beneficiary, or other person upon whom a warrant has been served for payments due the department or self-insurer. The notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be served by a method for which receipt can be confirmed or tracked accompanied by an affidavit of service by mailing or served by the sheriff of the county, or by the sheriff's deputy, or by any authorized representative of the director, director's designee, or self-insurer. Any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the notice within twenty days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired or in the notice and order to withhold and deliver. In the event there is in the possession of the party named and served with such notice and order, any property that may be subject to the claim of the department or self-insurer, such property shall be delivered forthwith to the director, the director's authorized representative, or self-insurer upon demand. If the party served and named in the notice and order fails to answer the notice and order within the time prescribed in this section, the court may, after the time to answer such order has expired, render judgment by default against the party named in the notice for the full amount, plus costs, claimed by the director, director's designee, or self-insurer in the notice. In the event that a notice to withhold and deliver is served upon an employer and the property found to be subject thereto is wages, the employer may assert in the answer all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the wage earner may be entitled.\n\nThis subsection shall only apply to orders assessing an overpayment which are issued on or after July 28, 1991: PROVIDED, That this subsection shall apply retroactively to all orders assessing an overpayment resulting from fraud, civil or criminal.\n\n(7) Orders assessing an overpayment which are issued on or after July 28, 1991, shall include a conspicuous notice of the collection methods available to the department or self-insurer.\n\n[ 2011 c 290 s 6; 2008 c 280 s 2; 2004 c 243 s 7; 2001 c 146 s 10.

When calculating assessments due to the department for which total claim costs are the basis, self-insured employers and self-insurance hospital groups formed under RCW 51.14.150 and 51.14.160 may deduct the cost of payments made under this section from the total of all claim costs reported.(6) For purposes of this section:(a) \"Health care employee\" means an employee of any health care facility or other organization that provides emergency or medical services who has or likely has had direct contact with any person who has been exposed to or tested positive for any infectious or contagious diseases which are the subject of a public health emergency.(b) \"Health care facility\" has the same meaning as in RCW 9A.50.010.(c) \"Public health emergency\" means a declaration or order that covers the jurisdiction where the employee was working on the date of exposure concerning any dangerous, contagious, or infectious diseases, including a pandemic, and is issued as follows:(i) The president of the United States has declared a national or regional emergency; or(ii) The governor of Washington declared a state of emergency under RCW 43.06.010(12).(7) The presumption in subsection (1) of this section takes effect on the day the national, regional, or state emergency is declared and continues until this declaration is revoked.(8) The provisions of RCW 51.28.055 concerning time limits for filing claims for occupational disease apply to claims covered under this section.\n\n(1) For health care employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases which are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency.\n\n(2) The health care employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department or the self-insurer that the employee is in quarantine or has contracted the disease after exposure to the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.\n\n(3) This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\n(a) The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or\n\n(b) The employee was working from the employee's home or other location not under the employer's control, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for the period of quarantine outlined for the disease immediately prior to the employee's date of disease contraction or period of incapacity resulting from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.\n\n(4)(a) RCW 51.32.090(7) does not apply to an occupational disease under this section except that no worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the occupational disease was contracted.
