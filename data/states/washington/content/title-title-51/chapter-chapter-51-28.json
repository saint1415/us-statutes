      "text": "RCW 51.28.015\n\nInjury reporting—Findings—Department educational initiative—Pilot program, employers to assist workers in applying for benefits—Report.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that:(a) In 1998, the joint legislative audit and review committee, in its performance audit of the Washington industrial insurance system, reported that one of the most significant causes for delayed benefit payments to workers and lack of employer involvement in claims was the manner in which claims were reported. Under this system of reporting, the worker generally reports the injury to a physician who, in turn, reports the injury to the department.(b) The performance audit further reported that adopting a system in which the employee reports to the employer and the employer reports to the department would speed the first payment of benefits to the worker and involve the employer, from the beginning of the claim, in assisting in the management of the claim, including returning the worker to work.(c) The performance audit also recognized that there would be instances in which workers would be reluctant to report injuries to employers and that, therefore, the system of physician reporting should be retained as an alternative, and employer reporting should be tested on a widespread basis.(2) The department of labor and industries shall develop and implement an initiative to:(a) Encourage the reporting of industrial injuries and occupational diseases by the worker to his or her employer and by the employer to the department;(b) Encourage the employer to provide assistance to the worker in completing the application for compensation; and(c) Educate workers and employers about the benefits and importance of prompt reporting of injuries and diseases.(3)(a) By January 1, 2007, the department shall develop and begin a pilot program to allow employers to assist workers in completing an application for benefits. This pilot program does not replace the current method for reporting as provided in RCW 51.28.020.(b) The department shall develop requirements or rules for employers who participate in the pilot program, including provisions to ensure prompt reporting of the claim and communicating a worker's rights and responsibilities under the pilot program. The pilot program shall include the voluntary participation of employers that represent a cross section of industries, geographic areas, union and nonunion workers, large and small businesses, and other criteria established by the department with input of business and labor leaders.(c) During the pilot period, the department shall consider steps to address the unique needs and issues of small employers.(d) The number of participating employers must not be more than five hundred during the first year of the pilot program. This number may be increased to seven hundred fifty during the second year of the pilot program.(e) The pilot program expires July 1, 2009.(4) On December 1, 2007, and December 1, 2008, the department of labor and industries shall report to the appropriate committees of the legislature the findings of a study of:(a) Claims that are not reported promptly, including but not limited to a review of the circumstances of such claims, the type of injuries involved in such claims, and the reasons for the failure to report such claims promptly;(b) The effect of the educational initiative required under subsection (2) of this section on whether the number of claims reported to employers increased, whether there was a reduction in delays in benefit payments, and whether there was an improvement in employer involvement in assisting with claims management and an increase in appropriate return-to-work and better outcomes for injured workers and employers;(c) The results of the efforts of the centers of occupational health education in early reporting and early notification of employers, and the general lessons that can be drawn from these results for the larger workers' compensation program; and(d) The results of the pilot program for workers to begin the process of applying for compensation through the employer and whether additional statutory changes are required or recommended to implement this process for all employers and workers.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that:\n\n(a) In 1998, the joint legislative audit and review committee, in its performance audit of the Washington industrial insurance system, reported that one of the most significant causes for delayed benefit payments to workers and lack of employer involvement in claims was the manner in which claims were reported.

(Effective until June 30, 2027.)\n\n(1) Whenever an employer has notice or knowledge of an injury or occupational disease sustained by any worker in his or her employment who has received treatment from a physician or a licensed *advanced registered nurse practitioner, has been hospitalized, disabled from work or has died as the apparent result of such injury or occupational disease, the employer shall immediately report the same to the department on forms prescribed by it. The report shall include:(a) The name, address, and business of the employer;(b) The name, address, and occupation of the worker;(c) The date, time, cause, and nature of the injury or occupational disease;(d) Whether the injury or occupational disease arose in the course of the injured worker's employment;(e) All available information pertaining to the nature of the injury or occupational disease including but not limited to any visible signs, any complaints of the worker, any time lost from work, and the observable effect on the worker's bodily functions, so far as is known; and(f) Such other pertinent information as the department may prescribe by regulation.(2) The employer shall not engage in claim suppression. An employer found to have engaged in claim suppression shall be subject to a penalty of at least two hundred fifty dollars, not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars, for each offense. The penalty shall be payable to the supplemental pension fund. The department shall adopt rules establishing the amount of penalties, taking into account the size of the employer and whether there are prior findings of claim suppression. When a determination of claim suppression has been made, the employer shall be prohibited from any current or future participation in a retrospective rating program. If self-insured, the director shall withdraw certification as provided in RCW 51.14.080.(3) When a determination of claim suppression is made and the penalty is assessed, the department shall serve the employer and any affected retrospective rating group with a determination as provided in RCW 51.52.050. The determination may be protested to the department or appealed to the board of industrial insurance appeals. Once the order is final, the amount due shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of RCW 51.48.140 and 51.48.150.(4) The director, or the director's designee, shall investigate reports or complaints that an employer has engaged in claim suppression as prohibited in RCW 51.28.010(3). The complaints or allegations must be received in writing, and must include the name or names of the individuals or organizations submitting the complaint. In cases where the department can show probable cause, the director may subpoena records from the employer, medical providers, and any other entity that the director believes may have relevant information. The director's investigative and subpoena authority in this subsection is limited solely to investigations into allegations of claim suppression or where the director has probable cause that claim suppression might have occurred.(5) If the director determines that an employer has engaged in claim suppression and, as a result, the worker has not filed a claim for industrial insurance benefits as prescribed by law, then the director in his or her sole discretion may waive the time limits for filing a claim provided in RCW 51.28.050, if the complaint or allegation of claim suppression is received within two years of the worker's accident or exposure.
