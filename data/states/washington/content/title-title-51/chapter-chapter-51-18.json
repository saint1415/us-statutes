As a result, the number of industrial insurance claims of many employers participating in the retrospective rating plan have been reduced through sound risk management strategies and enhanced cooperation with department claims management activities.The legislature further finds that entrance criteria for the retrospective rating plan under RCW 51.16.035 should be clear and understandable to both the department and potential retrospective rating plan participants.The legislature therefore declares that a new retrospective rating plan is needed in order to protect and preserve the integrity and welfare of the retrospective rating system.\n\nThe legislature finds that the retrospective rating plan provided for in RCW 51.16.035 has proven to be highly effective both in terms of improved workplace safety and injured worker outcomes.
