However, under the existence of the conditions set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, then the proportion must be as specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section:(1) Whenever any bonds of any local improvement district have been guaranteed under this section and RCW 57.20.080 and 57.20.090 and the guaranty fund does not have a cash balance equal to twenty percent of all bonds originally guaranteed under this section and RCW 57.20.080 and 57.20.090 (excluding issues which have been retired in full), then twenty percent of the gross monthly revenues derived from water, sewer, and drainage systems in the territory included in the local improvement district (but not necessarily from users in other parts of the district as a whole) shall be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund, except that whenever under the requirements of this subsection, the cash balance accumulates so that it is equal to twenty percent of all bonds guaranteed, or to the full amount of all bonds guaranteed, outstanding and unpaid (which amount might be less than twenty percent of the original total guaranteed), then no further money need be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund so long as the condition shall continue.(2) Whenever any warrants issued against the guaranty fund, as provided in this section, remain outstanding and uncalled for lack of funds for six months from the date of issuance thereof; or whenever any coupons or bonds guaranteed under this section and RCW 57.20.080 and 57.20.090 have been matured for six months and have not been redeemed either in cash or by issuance and delivery of warrants upon the guaranty fund, then twenty percent of the gross monthly revenues (or such portion thereof as the commissioners of the district determine will be sufficient to retire the warrants or redeem the coupons or bonds in the ensuing six months) derived from all water, sewer, and drainage system users in the district shall be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund. However, whenever under the requirements of this subsection all warrants, coupons, or bonds specified in this subsection have been redeemed, no further income needs to be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund under the requirements of this subsection until and unless other warrants remain outstanding and unpaid for six months or other coupons or bonds default.(3) For the purposes of complying with the requirements of setting aside and paying into the local improvement guaranty fund a proportion of the monthly gross revenues of the water supply, sewer, or drainage system of any district, as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, that district shall bind and obligate itself to maintain and operate the applicable system and further bind and obligate itself to establish, maintain, and collect such rates for water, sewer, or drainage as will produce gross revenues sufficient to maintain and operate that system and to make necessary provision for the local improvement guaranty fund as specified by this section and RCW 57.20.080 and 57.20.090. The district shall alter its rates for water, sewer, and drainage service from time to time and shall vary the same in different portions of its territory to comply with those requirements.(4) Whenever any coupon or bond guaranteed by this section shall mature and there shall not be sufficient funds in the appropriate local improvement district bond redemption fund to pay the same, then the applicable county treasurer shall pay same from the local improvement guaranty fund of the district; if there shall not be sufficient funds in the guaranty fund to pay same, then the same may be paid by issuance and delivery of a warrant upon the local improvement guaranty fund.(5) Whenever the cash balance in the local improvement guaranty fund is insufficient for the required purposes, warrants drawing interest at a rate determined by the commissioners may be issued by the applicable county auditor, against the fund to meet any liability accrued against it and must be issued upon demand of the holders of any maturing coupons and/or bonds guaranteed by this section, or to pay for any certificates of delinquency for delinquent installments of assessments as provided in subsection (6) of this section.
