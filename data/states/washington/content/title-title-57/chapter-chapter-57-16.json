A district may prepare a separate general comprehensive plan for each of these services and other services that districts are permitted to provide, or the district may combine any or all of its comprehensive plans into a single general comprehensive plan.(1) For a general comprehensive plan of a water supply system, the commissioners shall investigate the several portions and sections of the district for the purpose of determining the present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof; shall examine and investigate, determine, and select a water supply or water supplies for such district suitable and adequate for present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof; and shall consider and determine a general system or plan for acquiring such water supply or water supplies, and the lands, waters, and water rights and easements necessary therefor, and for retaining and storing any such waters, and erecting dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipe lines to convey the same throughout such district. There may be included as part of the system the installation of fire hydrants at suitable places throughout the district. The commissioners shall determine a general comprehensive plan for distributing such water throughout such portion of the district as may then reasonably be served by means of subsidiary aqueducts and pipe lines, and a long-term plan for financing the planned projects and the method of distributing the cost and expense thereof, including the creation of local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts, and shall determine whether the whole or part of the cost and expenses shall be paid from revenue or general obligation bonds.(2) For a general comprehensive plan for a sewer system, the commissioners shall investigate all portions and sections of the district and select a general comprehensive plan for a sewer system for the district suitable and adequate for present and reasonably foreseeable future needs thereof.

The general comprehensive plan must provide for treatment plants or the use of existing treatment plants and other methods and services, if any, for reclaiming water and must, for such portions of the district as may then reasonably be served, provide for a general system or plan for acquiring the lands and easements necessary therefor, including retaining and storing reclaimed water, and for the acquisition or construction and installation of mains, transmission mains, pumping stations, hydrants, or other facilities and systems for the reclamation and transmission of reclaimed water throughout such district for such uses, public and private, as authorized by law.
