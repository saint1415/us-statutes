By October 1, 2010, and October 1st of every year thereafter, the department must finalize the certification. Once finalized, no changes may be made to the certification for any reason. Certifications must be based on distributions of sales and use taxes imposed under RCW 82.14.030(1) made by the department of revenue in the fiscal year that ended during the calendar year of certification, streamlined sales tax mitigation data for mitigation distributions authorized under *RCW 82.14.495 made in the fiscal year that ended during the calendar year of certification, and population as last determined by the office of financial management.(7) All distributions to local governments from the city-county assistance account constitute increases in state distributions of revenue to political subdivisions for purposes of state reimbursement for the costs of new programs and increases in service levels under RCW 43.135.060, including any claims or litigation pending against the state on or after January 1, 2005.(8) As used in this section, \"streamlined sales tax mitigation funds\" means an amount determined by the department of revenue equal to the actual mitigation distribution amount under *RCW 82.14.495 received by a jurisdiction in four consecutive calendar quarters, less the mitigation distribution amount that would have been received by the jurisdiction during the same four calendar quarters had mitigation been calculated without the local sales tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1). If the difference is a negative amount or if a jurisdiction does not receive any mitigation distribution during the applicable four calendar quarters, then \"streamlined sales tax mitigation funds\" is zero.\n\n(1) The city-county assistance account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from real estate excise tax disbursements provided under RCW 82.45.060 must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the purposes provided in this section.\n\n(2) Funds deposited in the city-county assistance account must be distributed equally to the cities and counties.\n\n(3)(a) Funds distributed to counties must, to the extent possible, increase the sum of revenues under RCW 82.14.030(1) and streamlined sales tax mitigation funds received by each county

capita level of sales and use tax revenues received under RCW 82.14.030(1) with respect to taxable activity in the unincorporated areas of all counties imposing the sales and use tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1) in the previous calendar year, for certifications before October 1, 2009, or the previous fiscal year, for certifications on and after October 1, 2009; and\n\n(ii) For a county with an unincorporated population of more than one hundred thousand, sixty-five percent of the statewide weighted average per capita level of sales and use tax revenues received under RCW 82.14.030(1) with respect to taxable activity in the unincorporated areas of all counties imposing the sales and use tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1) in the previous calendar year, for certifications before October 1, 2009, or the previous fiscal year, for certifications on and after October 1, 2009.\n\n(b) For each county with an unincorporated population of fifteen thousand or less, the county must receive the greater of the amount in (a) of this subsection or the amount received in local government assistance provided by section 716, chapter 276, Laws of 2004.\n\n(c) For each county with an unincorporated population of more than fifteen thousand and less than twenty-two thousand, the county must receive in calendar year 2006 and 2007 the greater of the amount provided in (a) of this subsection or the amount received in local government assistance provided by section 716, chapter 276, Laws of 2004.\n\n(d) To the extent that revenues are insufficient to fund the distributions under this subsection, the distributions of all counties as otherwise determined under this subsection must be ratably reduced.\n\n(e) To the extent that revenues exceed the amounts needed to fund the distributions under this subsection, the excess funds must be divided ratably based upon unincorporated population among those counties receiving funds under this subsection and imposing the tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(2) at the maximum rate.\n\n(4)(a) For each city with a population of five thousand or less with a per capita assessed property value less than twice the statewide average per capita assessed property value for all cities for the calendar year previous to the certification under subsection (6) of this section, the city must receive the greater of the following three amounts:\n\n(i) An amount necessary to increase the sum of revenues under RCW 82.14.030(1) and streamlined sales tax mitigation funds received by a city up to fifty-five percent of the statewide weighted average per capita level of sales and use tax revenues received under RCW 82.14.030(1) with respect to taxable activity in all cities imposing the sales and use tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1) in the previous calendar year, for certifications before October 1, 2009, or the previous fiscal year, for certifications on and after October 1, 2009.\n\n(ii) The amount received in local government assistance provided for fiscal year 2005 by section 721, chapter 25, Laws of 2003 1st sp. sess.\n\n(iii) For a city with a per capita assessed property value less than fifty-five percent of the statewide average per capita assessed property value for all cities, an amount determined by subtracting the city's per capita assessed property value from fifty-five percent of the statewide average per capita assessed property value, dividing that amount by one thousand, and multiplying the result by the city's population.\n\n(b) For each city with a population of more than five thousand with a per capita assessed property value less than the statewide average per capita assessed property value for all cities for the calendar year previous to the certification under subsection (6) of this section, the city must receive the greater of the following two amounts:\n\n(i) An amount necessary to increase the sum of revenues under RCW 82.14.030(1) and streamlined sales tax mitigation funds received by a city up to fifty percent of the statewide weighted average per capita level of sales and use tax revenues received under RCW 82.14.030(1) with respect to taxable activity in all cities imposing the sales and use tax authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1) in the previous calendar year, for certifications before October 1, 2009, or the previous fiscal year, for certifications on and after October 1, 2009.\n\n(ii) For a city with a per capita assessed property value less than fifty-five percent of the statewide average per capita assessed property value for all cities, an amount determined by subtracting the city's per capita assessed property value from fifty-five percent of the statewide average per capita assessed property value, dividing that amount by one thousand, and multiplying the result by the city's population.\n\n(c) No city may receive an amount greater than one hundred thousand dollars a year under (a) or (b) of this subsection.\n\n(d) To the extent that revenues are insufficient to fund the distributions under this subsection, the distributions of all cities as otherwise determined under this subsection must be ratably reduced.\n\n(e) To the extent that revenues exceed the amounts needed to fund the distributions under this subsection, the excess funds must be divided ratably based upon population among those cities receiving funds under this subsection and imposing the tax collected under RCW 82.14.030(2) at the maximum rate.\n\n(f) This subsection only applies to cities incorporated before August 1, 2005.\n\n(5) The two hundred fifty thousand dollar amount in subsection (3) of this section and the one hundred thousand dollar amount in subsection (4) of this section must be increased each year beginning in calendar year 2006 by inflation as defined in RCW 84.55.005, as determined by the department of revenue.\n\n(6)(a) Distributions under subsections (3) and (4) of this section must be made quarterly beginning on October 1, 2005, based on population as last determined by the office of financial management. The department of revenue must certify the amounts to be distributed under this section by the state treasurer. The certification must be made by October 1, 2005, for the October 1, 2005, distribution and the January 1, 2006, distribution, based on calendar year 2004 department of revenue distributions of sales and use taxes authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1). The certification must be made by March 1, 2006, for distributions beginning April 1, 2006, by March 1, 2007, for distributions beginning April 1, 2007, and by March 1, 2008, for distributions beginning April 1, 2008. The March 1st certification must be used for distributions occurring on April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of the year of certification and on January 1st of the year following certification.\n\n(b) By March 1, 2009, the department of revenue must certify the amounts to be distributed under this section on April 1, 2009, July 1, 2009, and October 1, 2009. The certification must be based on calendar year 2008 department of revenue distributions of sales and use taxes authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1), and the population as last determined by the office of financial management.\n\n(c) By October 1, 2009, the department of revenue must certify the amounts to be distributed under this section on January 1, 2010, April 1, 2010, July 1, 2010, and October 1, 2010. The certification must be based on department of revenue distributions in fiscal year 2009 of sales and use taxes authorized under RCW 82.14.030(1), streamlined sales tax mitigation data for mitigation distributions authorized under *RCW 82.14.495 made December 2008 through September 2009, and population as last determined by the office of financial management.\n\n(d) By September 1, 2010, and September 1st of every year thereafter, the department of revenue must make available a preliminary certification of the amounts to be distributed under this section on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of the year immediately following certification.

The statues must be of deceased persons who were citizens of the respective state and are historically important figures or known for their distinguished civic or military service.(2) Washington has contributed to the collection a statue of Mother Joseph in 1980 and a statue of Marcus Whitman in 1953.(3) Marcus Whitman was a missionary who traveled to present-day Washington state with his wife Narcissa. Together, they established several missions as well as their own settlement, Waiilatupu, near present-day Walla Walla. Whitman assisted in the \"great emigration\" of 1843, which established the Oregon trail. Whitman's contributions to the creation of Washington were profound and important. Whitman has represented the state in the statuary hall for nearly 70 years. The legislature finds that it is appropriate to replace his statue with one of a more contemporary Washingtonian to further celebrate the state and the continuous contributions Washingtonians have made in the 20th and 21st centuries.(4) In the 1850s, the United States government signed a series of treaties with tribes in the region under which the tribes ceded millions of acres of land to the United States in exchange for agreeing to live on reservations while reserving what was most important to them: The right to continue to hunt, fish, and gather in all of their traditional places. Billy Frank Jr., born on March 9, 1931, on the banks of the Nisqually river in Washington, was a Nisqually tribal member and fought tirelessly to ensure that the United States government would honor the promises made in the treaties with Washington tribes. During his efforts, Billy Frank Jr. was arrested more than 50 times for exercising his treaty-protected right to fish for salmon, the first arrest being when he was 14 years old. He helped to stage \"fish-ins\" as protests, where he and others demanded that treaty tribes have the right to fish in their usual and accustomed places, a right that had been reserved in the treaty of Medicine Creek. His activism and perseverance paved the way for the \"Boldt decision\" in United States v. Washington, which affirmed the right of Washington treaty tribes to take up to half of the harvestable salmon in western Washington, reaffirmed tribal treaty-reserved rights, and established the tribes as comanagers of the salmon resource.(5) Billy Frank Jr. dedicated his life advocating for equality, justice, and environmental protections. He fought to protect tribal treaty rights, native cultures and traditions, and the natural resources they are based upon, including fish and shellfish. Despite long-standing persecution, Billy Frank Jr. worked tirelessly to protect salmon for the benefit and enjoyment of all Washingtonians. When salmon populations plummeted toward extinction, eventually to the point of being listed as threatened under the federal endangered species act, Billy Frank Jr. vocally advocated to unify people to reverse the trend. His endless work on salmon recovery was based on inclusivity and an understanding that tribal treaty rights will help recover salmon and would benefit the entire society and the economy in enumerable ways.(6) Billy Frank Jr. was a patron and the longtime chairman of, the northwest Indian fisheries commission, which assists its 20 member tribes in managing salmon and other natural resources and upholding tribal treaty rights, serves as an information clearinghouse, provides a forum for tribes to address issues of mutual concern, and works to establish relationships with government agencies and nongovernment organizations to recover salmon.(7) Billy Frank Jr.'s unwavering commitment to the fight for equality and the fight against racism and abuse was of global influence.(8) Billy Frank Jr. has been likened to other humanitarians and civil rights leaders such as Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Nelson Mandela.(9) In recognition of his distinguished accomplishments, Billy Frank Jr. was awarded the Albert Schweitzer prize for humanitarianism, the common cause award for human rights efforts, the American Indian distinguished service award, the Washington state environmental excellence award, and the Wallace Stegner award. Billy Frank Jr. was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom by President Barack Obama.(10) Congress passed the Billy Frank Jr. tell your story act, renaming the Nisqually national wildlife refuge in honor of Billy Frank Jr., and establishing a national memorial within the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually national wildlife refuge to commemorate the location of the signing of the 1854 treaty of Medicine Creek between the United States government and the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, and Squaxin Island tribes.(11) Billy Frank Jr. passed away on May 5, 2014, but he continues to be an inspiration to many domestically and abroad.(12) Billy Frank Jr. is a significant historical and civil rights figure who is worthy of recognition and inclusion in the national statuary hall collection.\" [ 2021 c 20 s 1.]\n\nFindings—2021 c 20: \"The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) In 1864, the national statuary hall collection was established in the United States capitol authorizing each state to contribute two statues to the collection.
