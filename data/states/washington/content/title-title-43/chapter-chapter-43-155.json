The December, 1983 Washington state public works report prepared by the planning and community affairs agency documented that local governments expect to be capable of financing over two billion dollars worth of the costs of those critical projects but will not be able to fund nearly half of the documented needs.The legislature further finds that Washington's local governments have unmet financial needs for solid waste disposal, including recycling, and encourages the board to make an equitable geographic distribution of the funds.It is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage self-reliance by local governments in meeting their public works needs and to assist in the financing of critical public works projects by making loans, grants, financing guarantees, and technical assistance available to local governments for these projects.\n\nThe legislature finds that there exists in the state of Washington over four billion dollars worth of critical projects for the planning, acquisition, construction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets and roads, bridges, water systems, and storm and sanitary sewage systems.

To ensure limited resources are provided as efficiently as possible, the board shall grant priority to emergency public works projects that replace existing infrastructure of the provider whose facilities were damaged by the unforeseen event and shall not provide funds to a new provider to overbuild the existing provider. The loans or grants may be used to help fund all or part of an emergency public works broadband infrastructure project less any reimbursement from any of the following sources: (i) Federal disaster or emergency funds, including funds from the federal emergency management agency; (ii) state disaster or emergency funds; (iii) insurance settlements; and (iv) litigation.\n\n(c) Eligible applicants for grants and loans awarded under this subsection are the same as those described in subsection (3) of this section.\n\n(15) The definitions in RCW 43.330.530 apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n\n(16) For purposes of this section, a \"proposed broadband project\" means a project that has been submitted as a preapplication to the public works board.\n\n[ 2022 c 201 s 1; 2021 c 332 s 7040; 2019 c 365 s 7.]\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 43.330.530 was alphabetized pursuant to RCW 1.08.015(2)(k), changing subsection (2) to subsection (4), effective July 1, 2023.\n\n*Reviser's note: RCW 43.330.530 was alphabetized pursuant to RCW 1.08.015(2)(k), changing subsection (2) to subsection (4), effective July 1, 2023.\n\nEffective date—2021 c 332: See note following RCW 43.19.501.\n\nEffective date—2021 c 332: See note following RCW 43.19.501.\n\nFindings—2019 c 365: See note following RCW 43.330.532.\n\nFindings—2019 c 365: See note following RCW 43.330.532.",
