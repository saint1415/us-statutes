These services include medical assistance, counseling, chore services, and child care.The legislature further finds that state investments in affordable housing, as enabled by the legislature in 1986, have exceeded $1,800,000,000 to provide over 55,000 units of safe and affordable housing to low-income individuals.\n\nThe legislature finds that current economic conditions, federal housing policies and declining resources at the federal, state, and local level adversely affect the ability of low and very low-income persons to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing.\n\nThe legislature further finds that members of over 150,000 households pay more than 50 percent of their income for rent and housing costs.\n\nThe legislature further finds that minorities, rural households, and migrant farmworkers require housing assistance at a rate which significantly exceeds their proportion of the general population.\n\nThe legislature further finds that one of the most dramatic housing needs is that of persons needing special housing-related services, such as individuals with mental illness, recovering alcoholics, frail elderly persons, families with members who have disabilities, and single parents.
