Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine.(2) Bonds shall not be issued under this section unless the public stadium authority has certified to the director of financial management that:(a) A professional football team has made a binding and legally enforceable contractual commitment to play all of its regular season and playoff home games in the stadium and exhibition center, other than games scheduled elsewhere by the league, for a period of time not shorter than the term of the bonds issued or to be issued to finance the initial construction of the stadium and exhibition center;(b) A team affiliate has entered into one or more binding and legally enforceable contractual commitments with a public stadium authority under RCW 36.102.050 that provide that:(i) The team affiliate assumes the risks of cost overruns;(ii) The team affiliate shall raise at least one hundred million dollars, less the amount, if any, raised by the public stadium authority under RCW 36.102.060(15).

In any event, all amounts to be raised by the team affiliate under (b)(ii) of this subsection shall be paid or expended before the completion of the construction of the stadium and exhibition center.
