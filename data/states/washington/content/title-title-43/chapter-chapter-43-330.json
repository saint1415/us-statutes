It is the intent of this chapter to create a department of commerce that fosters new partnerships for strong and sustainable communities. The mission of the department is to grow and improve jobs in Washington and facilitate innovation. To carry out its mission, the department will bring together focused efforts to: Streamline access to business assistance and economic development services by providing them through sector-based, cluster-based, and regional partners; provide focused and flexible responses to changing economic conditions; generate greater local capacity to respond to both economic growth and environmental challenges; increase accountability to the public, the executive branch, and the legislature; manage growth and achieve sustainable development; diversify the state's economy and export goods and services; provide greater access to economic opportunity; stimulate private sector investment and entrepreneurship; provide stable family-wage jobs and meet the diverse needs of families; provide affordable housing and housing services; and construct public infrastructure.The legislature further finds that as a result of the rapid pace of global social and economic change, the state and local communities will require coordinated and creative responses by every segment of the community. The state can play a role in assisting such local efforts by reorganizing state assistance efforts to promote such partnerships. The department has a primary responsibility to provide financial and technical assistance to the communities of the state, to assist in improving the delivery of federal, state, and local programs, and to provide communities with opportunities for productive and coordinated development beneficial to the well-being of communities and their residents. It is the intent of the legislature in creating the department to maximize the use of local expertise and resources in the delivery of community and economic development services.\n\nThe legislature finds that the long-term economic health of the state and its citizens depends upon the strength and vitality of its communities and businesses.

Hydrogen is an essential building block and energy carrier molecule that is necessary in the production of conventional and renewable fuels and a valuable decarbonization tool when used in sectors such as marine, aviation, steel, aluminum, and cement, as well as surface transportation including heavy duty vehicles, such as transit, trucking, and drayage equipment. Hydrogen can be a carbon-free fuel with an energy per unit mass that is three to four times greater than jet fuel, whose energy can be extracted either through thermochemical (combustion) or electrochemical (fuel cell) processes. In both cases, the only by-product is water, instead of the greenhouse gases and other conventional and toxic pollutants that are emitted from using fossil fuels.(2) The legislature further finds that the use of renewable hydrogen and hydrogen produced from carbon-free feedstocks through electrolysis is an essential tool to a clean energy ecosystem and emissions reduction for challenging infrastructure needs. Clean hydrogen fuel can be produced or \"charged\" closer to the generation of the electricity when the electrical supply grid has surplus energy, at times of low electricity use, such as evenings, then made available at times of higher need and convenient locations, such as fueling stations, avoiding the need to build or upgrade larger electrical infrastructure, including distribution systems, to meet higher peak demand for electricity.(3) Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish policies and a framework for the state to become a national and global leader in the production and use of these hydrogen fuels. This act will create an office of renewable fuels to: Promote partnerships among industrial, transportation, agriculture, and commercial interests as well as fuel producers, the technology research sector, and public sector agencies; identify barriers to and opportunities for market development; provide greater clarity and certainty in regulatory and siting standards; provide incentives and financial assistance in the deployment of hydrogen fuel infrastructure; support a clean and just energy transition; help create good quality, clean energy jobs; and improve air quality in degraded areas, particularly in communities that have borne disproportionate levels of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels.\" [ 2022 c 292 s 1.]\n\nFindings—Intent—2022 c 292: \"(1) The legislature finds that while hydrogen fuel has been used in a variety of applications in the state, the source of hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, such as natural gas.

      "text": "RCW 43.330.700\n\nFindings—Homeless youth.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that every night thousands of homeless youth in Washington go to sleep without the safety, stability, and support of a family or a home. This population is exposed to an increased level of violence, human trafficking, and exploitation resulting in a higher incidence of substance abuse, illness, and death. The prevention and reduction of youth and young adult homelessness and protection of homeless youth is of key concern to the state. Nothing in chapter 69, Laws of 2015 is meant to diminish the work accomplished by the implementation of Becca legislation but rather, the intent of the legislature is to further enhance the state's efforts in working with unaccompanied homeless youth and runaways to encourage family reconciliation or permanent housing and support through dependency when family reconciliation is not a viable alternative.(2) Successfully addressing youth and young adult homelessness ensures that homeless youth and young adults in our state have the support they need to thrive and avoid involvement in the justice system, human trafficking, long-term, avoidable use of public benefits, and extended adult homelessness.(3) Providing appropriate, relevant, and readily accessible services is critical for addressing one-time, episodic, or longer-term homelessness among youth and young adults, and keeping homeless youth and young adults safe, housed, and connected to family.(4) The coordination of statewide programs to combat youth and young adult homelessness should include programs addressing both youth and young adults. In some instances, best practices mandate that youth programs and young adult programs be segregated in their implementation; however, in other instances, innovative approaches can ensure the health and safety of both populations while serving them together, allowing for alignment with federal programs and funding opportunities, application of adolescent neurodevelopment research, and maximization of capacity to serve more dispersed populations in rural areas. The legislature further finds that the differing needs of these populations should be considered when assessing which programs are relevant and appropriate.(5) To successfully reduce and prevent youth and young adult homelessness, it is the goal of the legislature to have the following key components available and accessible:(a) Stable housing: It is the goal of the legislature to provide a safe and healthy place for homeless youth to sleep each night until permanency can be reached. Every homeless young adult in our state deserves access to housing that gives them a safe, healthy, and supported launching pad to adulthood. Every family in crisis should have appropriate support as they work to keep their children housed and safe. It is the goal of the legislature that every homeless youth discharged from a public system of care in our state will not be discharged into homelessness.(b) Family reconciliation: All homeless youth should have access to services that support reunification with immediate family. When reunification is not possible for homeless youth, youth should be placed in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families.(c) Permanent connections: Every homeless young adult should have opportunities to establish positive, healthy relationships with adults, including family members, employers, landlords, teachers, and community members, with whom they can maintain connections and from whom they can receive ongoing, long-term support to help them develop the skills and experiences necessary to achieve a successful transition to adulthood.(d) Education and employment: Every homeless young adult in our state deserves the opportunity and support they need to complete their high school education and pursue additional education and training. It is the goal of the legislature that every homeless young adult in our state will have the opportunity to engage in employment training and be able to access employment. With both education and employment support and opportunities, young adults will have the skills they need to become self-sufficient, self-reliant, and independent.(e) Social and emotional well-being: Every homeless youth and young adult in our state should have access to both behavioral health care and physical health care. Every state-funded program for homeless youth and young adults must endeavor to identify, encourage, and nurture each youth's strengths and abilities and demonstrate a commitment to youth-centered programming.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that every night thousands of homeless youth in Washington go to sleep without the safety, stability, and support of a family or a home.
