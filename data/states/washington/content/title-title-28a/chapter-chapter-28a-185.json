Such authority shall include the right to employ and pay special instructors and to operate such programs jointly with a public institution of higher education.(2) School districts that establish and operate programs for highly capable students shall adopt identification procedures and provide educational opportunities as follows:(a) In accordance with rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, school districts shall implement procedures for referral, screening, assessment, identification, and placement of highly capable students.(i) Referrals must be available for all grade levels not being universally screened, and may be submitted by teachers, other staff, parents, students, and members of the community.(ii) Each school district must select a grade level to implement universal screening procedures for each student. Universal screening must occur once in or before second grade, and again in or before sixth grade. The purpose of universal screening is to include students who traditionally are not referred for highly capable programs and services. Students discovered during universal screening may need further assessment to determine whether the student is eligible for placement in a program for highly capable students. Districts must consider at least two student data points during universal screening, which may include previously administered standardized, classroom-based, performance, cognitive, or achievement assessments, or research-based behavior ratings scales. There is no requirement to administer a new assessment for the purpose of universal screening, however districts may do so if they desire.(iii) Assessments for highly capable program services must be based upon a review of each student's capability as shown by multiple criteria intended to reveal, from a wide variety of sources and data, each student's unique needs and capabilities. Any screenings or additional assessments must be conducted within the school day and at the school the student attends, except that school districts, on a case-by-case basis and with the consent of the parent or guardian, may offer a student screenings or additional assessment opportunities during the summer, outside of school hours, or at an alternative site.(iv) Identification and placement decisions shall be made by a multidisciplinary selection committee after consideration of the results of the universal screening, any further assessment, and any available district data.
