The legislature also recognizes it takes time to make significant changes that are sustainable over the long term in an educational system that serves more than one million students from diverse communities.(2) The legislature further finds that it is the state's responsibility to create a coherent and effective accountability framework for the continuous improvement of all schools and school districts. This system must provide an excellent and equitable education for all students, an aligned federal and state accountability system, and the tools necessary for schools and school districts to be accountable. These tools include accounting and data reporting systems, assessment systems to monitor student achievement, and a comprehensive system of differentiated support, targeted assistance, and, if necessary, intervention.(3) The office of the superintendent of public instruction is responsible for developing and implementing the accountability tools to build district capacity and working within federal and state guidelines. The legislature assigned the state board of education responsibility and oversight for creating an accountability framework. This framework provides a unified system of support for challenged schools that aligns with basic education, increases the level of support based upon the magnitude of need, and uses data for decisions. Such a system will identify schools and their districts for recognition as well as for additional state support.(4) For a specific group of persistently lowest-achieving schools and their districts, it is necessary to provide a required action process that creates a partnership between the state and local district to target funds and assistance to turn around the identified schools. The legislature finds that state takeover of persistently lowest-achieving schools is unlikely to produce long-term improvement in student achievement because takeover is an unsustainable approach to school governance and an inadequate response to addressing the underlying barriers to improved outcomes for all students. However, in the rare case of a persistently lowest-achieving school that continues to fail to improve even after required action and supplemental assistance, it is appropriate and necessary to assign the superintendent of public instruction the responsibility to intercede, provide robust technical assistance, and direct the necessary interventions. Even though the superintendent of public instruction continues to work in partnership with the local school board, the superintendent of public instruction is accountable for assuring that adequate steps are taken to improve student achievement in these schools.(5) Phase I of this accountability system will recognize schools that have done an exemplary job of raising student achievement and closing the achievement gaps using the Washington achievement index adopted by the state board of education. The state board of education shall have ongoing collaboration with the educational opportunity gap oversight and accountability committee regarding the measures used to measure the closing of the achievement gaps and recognition provided to the school districts for closing the achievement gaps. Phase I will also target the lowest five percent of persistently lowest-achieving schools defined under federal guidelines to provide federal funds and federal intervention models through a voluntary option in 2010, and for those who do not volunteer and have not improved student achievement, a required action process beginning in 2011.(6) Phase II of this accountability system will work toward implementing the Washington achievement index for identification of challenged schools in need of improvement, including those that are not Title I schools, and the use of state and local intervention models and federal and state funds through a comprehensive system of differentiated support, targeted assistance, and intervention beginning in the 2014-15 school year. If federal approval of the Washington achievement index is not obtained, the federal guidelines for identifying schools will continue to be used. If it ever becomes necessary, a process is established to assign responsibility to the superintendent of public instruction to intervene in persistently lowest-achieving schools that have failed to improve despite required action.(7) The expectation from implementation of this accountability system is the improvement of student achievement for all students to prepare them for postsecondary education, work, and global citizenship in the twenty-first century.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that an effective educational accountability system is premised on creating and maintaining partnerships between the state and local school district boards of directors.

Unless otherwise required by subsection (3) of this section, the plan must be submitted under a schedule as required by the state board. A required action plan must be developed in collaboration with administrators, teachers, and other staff, parents, unions representing any employees within the district, students, and other representatives of the local community.(b) The superintendent of public instruction shall provide a district with assistance in developing its plan if requested, and shall develop and publish guidelines for the development of required action plans. The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, shall also publish a list of research and evidence-based school improvement models, consistent with turnaround principles, that are approved for use in required action plans.(c) The school board must conduct a public hearing to allow for comment on a proposed required action plan. The local school district shall submit the plan first to the office of the superintendent of public instruction to review and approve that the plan is consistent with federal and state guidelines, as applicable. After the office of the superintendent of public instruction has approved that the plan is consistent with federal and state guidelines, the local school district must submit its required action plan to the state board of education for approval.(2) A required action plan must include all of the following:(a) Implementation of an approved school improvement model required for the receipt of federal or state funds for school improvement for those persistently lowest-achieving schools that the district will be focusing on for required action. The approved school improvement model selected must address the concerns raised in the academic performance audit and be intended to improve student performance to allow a school district to be removed from the list of districts designated as a required action district by the state board of education within three years of implementation of the plan. The required action plan for districts with multiple persistently lowest-achieving schools must include separate plans for each school as well as a plan for how the school district will support the schools collectively;(b) Submission of an application for federal or state funds for school improvement to the superintendent of public instruction;(c) A budget that provides for adequate resources to implement the model selected and any other requirements of the plan;(d) A description of the changes in the district's or school's existing policies, structures, agreements, processes, and practices that are intended to attain significant achievement gains for all students enrolled in the school and how the district intends to address the findings of the academic performance audit; and(e) Identification of the measures that the school district will use in assessing student achievement at a school identified as a persistently lowest-achieving school, which include closing the educational opportunity gap, improving mathematics and reading or English language arts student achievement, and improving graduation rates as defined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction that enable the school to no longer be identified as a persistently lowest-achieving school.(3)(a) For any district designated for required action, the parties to any collective bargaining agreement negotiated, renewed, or extended under chapter 41.59 or 41.56 RCW after June 10, 2010, must reopen the agreement, or negotiate an addendum, if needed, to make changes to terms and conditions of employment that are necessary to implement a required action plan.(b) If the school district and the employee organizations are unable to agree on the terms of an addendum or modification to an existing collective bargaining agreement, the parties, including all labor organizations affected under the required action plan, shall request the public employment relations commission to, and the commission shall, appoint an employee of the commission to act as a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute between the school district and the employee organizations.

The issues for determination by the superior court must be limited to the issues certified by the executive director.(d) The process for filing with the court in this subsection (3)(d) must be used in the case where the executive director certifies issues for a decision by the superior court.(i) The school district shall file a petition with the superior court, by no later than May 20th of the same year in which the issues were certified, setting forth the following:(A) The name, address, and telephone number of the school district and its principal representative;(B) The name, address, and telephone number of the employee organizations and their principal representatives;(C) A description of the bargaining units involved;(D) A copy of the unresolved issues certified by the executive director for a final and binding decision by the court; and(E) The academic performance audit that the office of the superintendent of public instruction completed for the school district.(ii) Within seven days after the filing of the petition, each party shall file with the court the proposal it is asking the court to order be implemented in a required action plan for the district for each issue certified by the executive director. Contemporaneously with the filing of the proposal, a party must file a brief with the court setting forth the reasons why the court should order implementation of its proposal in the final plan.(iii) Following receipt of the proposals and briefs of the parties, the court must schedule a date and time for a hearing on the petition. The hearing must be limited to argument of the parties or their counsel regarding the proposals submitted for the court's consideration. The parties may waive a hearing by written agreement.(iv) The court must enter an order selecting the proposal for inclusion in a required action plan that best responds to the issues raised in the school district's academic performance audit, and allows for the award of federal or state funds for school improvement to the district from the office of the superintendent of public instruction to implement an approved school improvement model. The court's decision must be issued no later than June 15th of the year in which the petition is filed and is final and binding on the parties; however the court's decision is subject to appeal only in the case where it does not allow the school district to implement a required action plan consistent with the requirements for the award of federal or state funds for school improvement by the superintendent of public instruction.(e) Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees incurred under this statute.(f) Any party that proceeds with the process in this section after knowledge that any provision of this section has not been complied with and who fails to state its objection in writing is deemed to have waived its right to object.(4) All contracts entered into between a school district and an employee must be consistent with this section and allow school districts designated as required action districts to implement an approved school improvement model in a required action plan.\n\n(1)(a) The local district superintendent and local school board of a school district designated as a required action district must submit a required action plan to the state board of education for approval. Unless otherwise required by subsection (3) of this section, the plan must be submitted under a schedule as required by the state board. A required action plan must be developed in collaboration with administrators, teachers, and other staff, parents, unions representing any employees within the district, students, and other representatives of the local community.\n\n(b) The superintendent of public instruction shall provide a district with assistance in developing its plan if requested, and shall develop and publish guidelines for the development of required action plans. The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, shall also publish a list of research and evidence-based school improvement models, consistent with turnaround principles, that are approved for use in required action plans.\n\n(c) The school board must conduct a public hearing to allow for comment on a proposed required action plan. The local school district shall submit the plan first to the office of the superintendent of public instruction to review and approve that the plan is consistent with federal and state guidelines, as applicable. After the office of the superintendent of public instruction has approved that the plan is consistent with federal and state guidelines, the local school district must submit its required action plan to the state board of education for approval.\n\n(2) A required action plan must include all of the following:\n\n(a) Implementation of an approved school improvement model required for the receipt of federal or state funds for school improvement for those persistently lowest-achieving schools that the district will be focusing on for required action. The approved school improvement model selected must address the concerns raised in the academic performance audit and be intended to improve student performance to allow a school district to be removed from the list of districts designated as a required action district by the state board of education within three years of implementation of the plan. The required action plan for districts with multiple persistently lowest-achieving schools must include separate plans for each school as well as a plan for how the school district will support the schools collectively;\n\n(b) Submission of an application for federal or state funds for school improvement to the superintendent of public instruction;\n\n(c) A budget that provides for adequate resources to implement the model selected and any other requirements of the plan;\n\n(d) A description of the changes in the district's or school's existing policies, structures, agreements, processes, and practices that are intended to attain significant achievement gains for all students enrolled in the school and how the district intends to address the findings of the academic performance audit; and\n\n(e) Identification of the measures that the school district will use in assessing student achievement at a school identified as a persistently lowest-achieving school, which include closing the educational opportunity gap, improving mathematics and reading or English language arts student achievement, and improving graduation rates as defined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction that enable the school to no longer be identified as a persistently lowest-achieving school.\n\n(3)(a) For any district designated for required action, the parties to any collective bargaining agreement negotiated, renewed, or extended under chapter 41.59 or 41.56 RCW after June 10, 2010, must reopen the agreement, or negotiate an addendum, if needed, to make changes to terms and conditions of employment that are necessary to implement a required action plan.\n\n(b) If the school district and the employee organizations are unable to agree on the terms of an addendum or modification to an existing collective bargaining agreement, the parties, including all labor organizations affected under the required action plan, shall request the public employment relations commission to, and the commission shall, appoint an employee of the commission to act as a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute between the school district and the employee organizations. Beginning in 2011, and each year thereafter, mediation shall commence no later than April 15th. All mediations held under this section shall include the employer and representatives of all affected bargaining units.\n\n(c) If the executive director of the public employment relations commission, upon the recommendation of the assigned mediator, finds that the employer and any affected bargaining unit are unable to reach agreement following a reasonable period of negotiations and mediation, but by no later than May 15th of the year in which mediation occurred, the executive director shall certify any disputed issues for a decision by the superior court in the county where the school district is located. The issues for determination by the superior court must be limited to the issues certified by the executive director.\n\n(d) The process for filing with the court in this subsection (3)(d) must be used in the case where the executive director certifies issues for a decision by the superior court.\n\n(i) The school district shall file a petition with the superior court, by no later than May 20th of the same year in which the issues were certified, setting forth the following:\n\n(A) The name, address, and telephone number of the school district and its principal representative;\n\n(B) The name, address, and telephone number of the employee organizations and their principal representatives;\n\n(C) A description of the bargaining units involved;\n\n(D) A copy of the unresolved issues certified by the executive director for a final and binding decision by the court; and\n\n(E) The academic performance audit that the office of the superintendent of public instruction completed for the school district.\n\n(ii) Within seven days after the filing of the petition, each party shall file with the court the proposal it is asking the court to order be implemented in a required action plan for the district for each issue certified by the executive director. Contemporaneously with the filing of the proposal, a party must file a brief with the court setting forth the reasons why the court should order implementation of its proposal in the final plan.\n\n(iii) Following receipt of the proposals and briefs of the parties, the court must schedule a date and time for a hearing on the petition. The hearing must be limited to argument of the parties or their counsel regarding the proposals submitted for the court's consideration. The parties may waive a hearing by written agreement.\n\n(iv) The court must enter an order selecting the proposal for inclusion in a required action plan that best responds to the issues raised in the school district's academic performance audit, and allows for the award of federal or state funds for school improvement to the district from the office of the superintendent of public instruction to implement an approved school improvement model. The court's decision must be issued no later than June 15th of the year in which the petition is filed and is final and binding on the parties; however the court's decision is subject to appeal only in the case where it does not allow the school district to implement a required action plan consistent with the requirements for the award of federal or state funds for school improvement by the superintendent of public instruction.\n\n(e) Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees incurred under this statute.\n\n(f) Any party that proceeds with the process in this section after knowledge that any provision of this section has not been complied with and who fails to state its objection in writing is deemed to have waived its right to object.\n\n(4) All contracts entered into between a school district and an employee must be consistent with this section and allow school districts designated as required action districts to implement an approved school improvement model in a required action plan.\n\n[ 2013 c 159 s 6; (2013 c 159 s 5 expired June 30, 2019); (2012 c 53 s 10 expired June 30, 2019); 2010 c 235 s 105.]\n\nEffective date—2013 c 159 s 6: \"Section 6 of this act takes effect June 30, 2019.\" [ 2013 c 159 s 16.]\n\nEffective date—2013 c 159 s 6: \"Section 6 of this act takes effect June 30, 2019.\" [ 2013 c 159 s 16.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 c 159 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act expires June 30, 2019.\" [ 2013 c 159 s 15.]\n\nExpiration date—2013 c 159 s 5: \"Section 5 of this act expires June 30, 2019.\" [ 2013 c 159 s 15.]\n\nFinding—2010 c 235: See note following RCW 28A.405.245.\n\nFinding—2010 c 235: See note following RCW 28A.405.245.",

However, if the superintendent of public instruction finds that the level two required action plan is not being implemented as specified, including the implementation of any binding conditions within the plan, the superintendent may direct actions that must be taken by school district personnel to implement the level two required action plan or the binding conditions. If necessary, the superintendent of public instruction may exercise authority under RCW 28A.505.120 regarding allocation of funds.(7) The superintendent of public instruction shall include in the budget estimates and information submitted to the governor under RCW 28A.300.170 a request for sufficient funds to support implementation of the level two required action plans established under this section.(8) The superintendent of public instruction must recommend to the state board of education that a school district be released from assignment to level two of the required action process after the district implements the level two required action plan for a period of three years; has made progress, as defined by the superintendent of public instruction using the criteria established under RCW 28A.657.020; and no longer has a school within the district identified as persistently lowest-achieving. The state board of education shall release a school district from the level two assignment upon confirmation that the school district has met the requirements for a release.\n\n(1) School districts assigned by the state board of education to level two of the required action process under this chapter are those with one or more schools that have remained as persistently lowest-achieving for more than three years and have not demonstrated recent and significant improvement or progress toward exiting persistently lowest-achieving status, despite implementation of a required action plan.\n\n(2) Within ninety days following assignment of a school district to level two of the required action process, the superintendent of public instruction shall direct that a needs assessment and review be conducted to determine the reasons why the previous required action plan did not succeed in improving student achievement.\n\n(3)(a) Based on the results of the needs assessment and review, the superintendent of public instruction shall work collaboratively with the school district board of directors to develop a revised required action plan for level two.\n\n(b) The level two required action plan must explicitly address the reasons why the previous plan did not succeed and must specify the interventions that the school district must implement, which may include assignment or reassignment of personnel, reallocation of resources, use of specified curriculum or instructional strategies, use of a specified school improvement model, or any other conditions determined by the superintendent of public instruction to be necessary for the level two required action plan to succeed, which conditions shall be binding on the school district. The level two required action plan shall also include the specific technical assistance and support to be provided by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, which may include assignment of school improvement specialists to have a regular on-site presence in the school and technical assistance provided through the educational service district. Individuals assigned as on-site school improvement specialists must have demonstrated experience in school turnaround and cultural competence.\n\n(c) The level two required action plan must be submitted to the state board of education for approval.\n\n(4) If the superintendent of public instruction and the school district board of directors are unable to come to an agreement on a level two required action plan within ninety days of the completion of the needs assessment and review conducted under subsection (2) of this section, the superintendent of public instruction shall complete and submit a level two required action plan directly to the state board of education for approval. The school district board of directors may submit a request to the required action plan review panel established under RCW 28A.657.070 for reconsideration of the superintendent's level two required action plan within ten days of the submission of the plan to the state board of education. After the state board of education considers the recommendations of the required action plan review panel, the decision of the board regarding the level two required action plan is final and not subject to further reconsideration.\n\n(5) If changes to a collective bargaining agreement are necessary to implement a level two required action plan, the parties must reopen the agreement, or negotiate an addendum, using the process outlined under RCW 28A.657.050. If the level two required action plan is developed by the superintendent of public instruction under subsection (4) of this section, a designee of the superintendent shall participate in the discussions among the parties to the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n(6) While a school district is assigned to level two of the required action process under this chapter, the superintendent of public instruction is responsible and accountable for assuring that the level two required action plan is implemented with fidelity. The superintendent of public instruction shall defer to the school district board of directors as the governing authority of the school district and continue to work in partnership with the school district to implement the level two required action plan.
