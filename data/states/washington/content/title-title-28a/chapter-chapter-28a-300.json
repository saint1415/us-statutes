The legislature intends to redesign the current statewide system, in accordance with the recommendations of the Washington assessment of student learning legislative work group, to:(a) Include multiple assessment formats, including both formative and summative, as necessary to provide information to help improve instruction and inform accountability;(b) Enable collection of data that allows both statewide and nationwide comparisons of student learning and achievement; and(c) Be balanced so that the information used to make significant decisions that affect school accountability or student educational progress includes many data points and does not rely on solely the results of a single assessment.(2) The legislature further finds that one component of the assessment system should be instructionally supportive formative assessments. The key design elements or characteristics of an instructionally supportive assessment must:(a) Be aligned to state standards in areas that are being assessed;(b) Measure student growth and competency at multiple points throughout the year in a manner that allows instructors to monitor student progress and have the necessary trend data with which to improve instruction;(c) Provide rapid feedback;(d) Link student growth with instructional elements in order to gauge the effectiveness of educators and curricula;(e) Provide tests that are appropriate to the skill level of the student;(f) Support instruction for students of all abilities, including highly capable students and students with learning disabilities;(g) Be culturally, linguistically, and cognitively relevant, appropriate, and understandable to each student taking the assessment;(h) Inform parents and draw parents into greater participation of the student's study plan;(i) Provide a way to analyze the assessment results relative to characteristics of the student such as, but not limited to, English language learners, gender, ethnicity, poverty, age, and disabilities;(j) Strive to be computer-based and adaptive; and(k) Engage students in their learning.(3) The legislature further finds that a second component of the assessment system should be a state-administered summative achievement assessment that can be used as a check on the educational system in order to guide state expectations for the instruction of children and satisfy legislative demands for accountability. The key design elements or characteristics of the state administered achievement assessment must:(a) Be aligned to state standards in areas that are being assessed;(b) Maintain and increase academic rigor;(c) Measure student learning growth over years; and(d) Strengthen curriculum.(4) The legislature further finds that a third component of the assessment system should include classroom-based assessments, which may be formative, summative, or both. Depending on their use, classroom-based assessments should have the same design elements and characteristics described in this section for formative and summative assessments.(5) The legislature further finds that to sustain a strong and viable assessment system, preservice and ongoing training should be provided for teachers and administrators on the effective use of different types of assessments.(6) The legislature further finds that as the statewide data system is developed, data should be collected for all state-required statewide assessments to be used for accountability and to monitor overall student achievement.(7) The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, shall begin design and development of an overall assessment system that meets the principles and characteristics described in this section. In designing formative and summative assessments, the superintendent shall solicit bids for the use of computerized adaptive testing methodologies.(8) Beginning December 1, 2009, and annually thereafter, the superintendent and state board shall jointly report to the legislature regarding the assessment system, including a cost analysis of any changes and costs to expand availability and use of instructionally supportive formative assessments.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that a statewide student assessment system should improve and inform classroom instruction, support accountability, and provide useful information to all levels of the educational system, including students, parents, teachers, schools, school districts, and the state.

The legislature finds there is no better opportunity to make a strong commitment to closing the achievement gap and to affirm the state's constitutional obligation to provide opportunities to learn for all students without distinction or preference on account of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or gender.\n\n(2) The legislature further finds that access to comprehensive and consistent data that is disaggregated in the smallest units allowable by law is important in closing the achievement gap. Policymakers and educators need as much information as possible not only about students' academic progress, but also about other factors across multiple disciplines that affect student performance.\n\n(3) A consistent and powerful theme throughout the achievement gap studies was the need for cultural competency in instruction, curriculum, assessment, and professional development. Cultural competency forms a foundation for efforts to address the achievement gap, and more work is needed to embed it into the public school system.\n\n(4) Therefore, following the priority recommendations from the achievement gap studies, the legislature intends to:\n\n(a) Provide resources to support parent and community involvement and outreach efforts by public schools, including such items as additional notices and communication to parents, translations, translators, parent and community meetings, and school events within the community. The legislature encourages school districts to consult with the office of the education ombudsman [ombuds] in developing plans for parent and community involvement and outreach;\n\n(b) Require that teachers demonstrate cultural competency in the classroom and with students at each level of state teacher certification, and provide additional opportunities for professional development in cultural competency for current teachers;\n\n(c) Create local alternative routes to teacher certification for paraeducators and individuals in the communities surrounding schools and school districts that are struggling to address the achievement gap;\n\n(d) Reexamine the study recommendations regarding data and accountability and identify ways for the education data system to address these needs; and\n\n(e) Sustain efforts to close the achievement gap over the long term by creating a high profile achievement gap oversight and accountability committee that will provide ongoing advice to education agencies and report annually to the legislature and the governor.\" [ 2009 c 468 s 1.]",

During the war, more than four hundred fifty thousand women served their country in the armed forces of the United States. Another group of women provided nursing and support services to the troops. These women were joined by more than two million women back home who, like Rosie the Riveter, worked in industries that supported service men and women abroad. Other women held the nation together by raising families, educating children, and taking care of the ill and elderly. These women held our families, businesses, and communities together, living with rationed goods and services so that the service men and women fighting in the war would have the materials they needed to be successful. The legislature finds that women in all these roles made sacrifices necessary for the success of our nation's defense and contributions essential to the well-being of the people back home.
