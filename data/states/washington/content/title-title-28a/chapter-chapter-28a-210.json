An estimated five hundred thousand residents of the state suffer from asthma. Since 1995, asthma has claimed more than five hundred lives, caused more than twenty-five thousand hospitalizations with costs of more than one hundred twelve million dollars, and resulted in seven million five hundred thousand missed school days. School nurses have identified over four thousand children with life-threatening asthma in the state's schools.(2) While asthma is found among all populations, its prevalence disproportionately affects low-income and minority populations. Untreated asthma affects worker productivity and results in unnecessary absences from work. In many cases, asthma triggers present in substandard housing and poorly ventilated workplaces contribute directly to asthma.(3) Although research continues into the causes and cures for asthma, national consensus has been reached on treatment guidelines. People with asthma who are being treated in accordance with these guidelines are far more likely to control the disease than those who are not being treated and therefore are less likely to experience debilitating or life-threatening asthma episodes, less likely to be hospitalized, and less likely to need to curtail normal school or work activities. With treatment, most people with asthma are able to live normal, active lives.(4) Up to one-third of the people with asthma have not had their disease diagnosed.
