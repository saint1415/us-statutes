Further, the personal enrichment and success of Washington citizens increasingly relies on their ability to use the state's postsecondary education and training system. To accomplish those ends, the legislature desires to increase the number of students who begin earning college credits while still in high school.\n\n(2) The legislature further finds that dual credit programs introduce students to college-level work, provide a jump start on getting a college degree, and, perhaps most importantly, show students that they can succeed in college. Dual credit programs also provide another avenue of student financial aid, since many programs are offered for little or no cost to students.\n\n(3) The legislature also finds that students must be provided a choice when selecting a dual credit program that is right for them. Options should be available for the student who wants to learn on a college campus and the student who wants to stay at the high school and take college-level courses. Options must also be available for the hands-on learner who seeks to complete an apprenticeship program.\n\n(4) The legislature intends to blur the line between high school and college by articulating a vision to dramatically increase participation in dual credit programs. It is for this reason that the legislature should call on all education stakeholders to come together to coordinate resources, track outcomes, and improve program availability.\n\n(5) The legislature further intends to provide high schools, colleges, and universities with a set of tools for growing and coordinating dual credit programs. Institutions should be given some flexibility in determining the best methods to secure long-term, ample financial support for these programs, while students should be given some help in offsetting instructional costs.\" [ 2009 c 450 s 1.]",

The legislature acknowledges that emergency expulsion is limited to 10 consecutive school days, the school must provide an opportunity for the student to receive educational services during the emergency expulsion, and both the emergency expulsion and any suspension or expulsion that the emergency expulsion is converted to can be appealed. However, the legislature finds that emergency expulsion tarnishes a student's reputation and self-image, which can result in school staff, fellow students, or the student's families making assumptions about the student, and, in some cases, these assumptions result in harassment, intimidation, or bullying of the student. Therefore, the legislature intends to discontinue the use of the prejudicial term \"emergency expulsion,\" and replace it with the term \"emergency removal,\" which is a more accurate description of the temporary removal of a student from school to assess and properly respond to an emergent situation involving the student.(2) As soon as possible after July 23, 2023, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must publish a bulletin to notify school districts and public schools that the term \"emergency removal\" must be used instead of the term \"emergency expulsion\" in the context of student discipline and as required by RCW 28A.300.042 and 28A.600.015.
