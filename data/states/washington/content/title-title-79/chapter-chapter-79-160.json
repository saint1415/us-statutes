There is a growing problem where aquatic or overwater structures become derelict or fall into disrepair. These derelict aquatic structures are public nuisances and safety hazards as they can pose risks to navigation, harm nearshore habitat for threatened and endangered species, detract from the aesthetics of Washington's waterfronts, and threaten the environment with the potential release of hazardous materials.(2) The legislature further finds that the costs associated with the proper removal or repair of derelict aquatic structures are substantial and that in many cases owners of these structures lack the financial means to address the safety and environmental hazards the structures pose. As a result, the costs associated with the removal or repair of derelict structures becomes a burden on public entities and the taxpaying public.(3) The legislature also finds that removal of derelict aquatic structures and restoration of surrounding habitat improves nearshore habitat quality.\n\n(1) The legislature finds that nearshore habitat is amongst the most important for threatened and endangered species of salmon, yet nearshore habitat in populated areas is often negatively impacted by man-made structures.
