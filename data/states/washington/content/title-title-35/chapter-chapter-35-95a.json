The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the city creating the authority at least once a week for two weeks, not less than sixty days before the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals. The notice must state in summary form: (i) The general scope and nature of the design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other services being sought related to the development of the proposed monorail, tram, or trolley public transportation system; (ii) the name and address of a representative of the city transportation authority who can provide further details; (iii) the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals; (iv) an estimated schedule for the consideration of qualifications statements or proposals, the selection of vendors, and the negotiation of a contract or contracts for services; (v) the location of which a copy of any requests for qualifications statements or requests for proposals will be made available; and (vi) the criteria established by the governing body of the authority to select a vendor or vendors, which may include, but is not limited to, the vendor's prior experience, including design, construction, operation, or maintenance of other similar public transportation facilities, respondent's management capabilities, proposed project schedule, availability and financial resources, costs of the services to be provided, nature of facility design proposed by the vendors, system reliability, performance standards required for the facilities, compatibility with existing public transportation facilities operated by the authority or any other public body or other providers of similar services to the public, project performance guarantees, penalties, and other enforcement provisions, environmental protection measures to be used by the vendor, consistency with the applicable regional transportation plans, and the proposed allocation of project risks.(c) If the governing body of the city transportation authority decides to proceed with the consideration of qualifications statements or proposals submitted by vendors, it may designate a representative to evaluate the vendors who submitted qualifications statements or proposals and conduct discussions regarding qualifications or proposals with one or more vendors. The governing body or its representative may request submission of qualifications statements and may later request more detailed proposals from one or more vendors who have submitted qualifications statements, or may request detailed proposals without having first received and evaluated qualifications statements. The governing body or its representative will evaluate the qualifications or proposals, as applicable. If two or more vendors submit qualifications or proposals that meet the criteria established by the governing body of the authority, discussions and interviews must be held with at least two vendors.

The signage must employ graphics consistent with international symbols for transportation facilities and signage that are consistent with department of transportation guidelines and programs. The signage must also use distinguishing pictograms as a means to identify stations and points of interest along the monorail corridor for persons who use languages that are not Roman-alphabet based. These requirements are intended to apply to new sign installation and not to existing signs. The authority may replace existing signs as it chooses; however, it shall use the new signing designs when existing signs are replaced. All signage must comply with requirements of applicable federal law and may include recommendations contained in federal publications providing directions on way-finding for persons with disabilities.\n\nEach authority shall incorporate in plans for stations along any monorail project signing that is easily understood by the traveling public, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities, non-English-speaking persons, and visitors from other nations.

These signs can be used on roadways and for other transportation-related facilities such as transit stations, airports, bus and train stations, and ferry terminals. Pictograms are signs that depict services, facilities, or destinations in picture form and are used throughout the world. Pictograms are useful for traveling within a transit system as well as for locating transit system stations and stops.The legislature finds that many signing methods such as icons, already in use by the Washington state department of transportation and other agencies, facilitate use of the transportation systems in the state and connections between modes. The legislature also finds that the development of pictograms for use within transit systems will assist system users, complement other signing methods, and increase transit system ridership through easier way-finding. The pictograms may reflect the unique characteristics of the facility, and those characteristics should be considered and are acceptable in icon and pictogram design. It is the intent of the legislature to have icons and pictograms in use as new systems are put into service to promote tourism and be in place by 2010 to assist international visitors coming to Washington during the Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\" [ 2005 c 19 s 1.]\n\nIntent—Findings—2005 c 19: \"It is the intent of the legislature to promote the use of icons and pictograms that incorporate the use of commonly accepted symbols that can be understood and interpreted by a variety of people from all walks of life and different nations in order to assist them in the navigation of this state.
