The establishment of such a system shall be subject to the provisions of article six of said chapter. The county commission may adopt rules after receiving recommendations from the West Virginia Enhanced 911 Council concerning the operation of all county emergency communications centers or emergency telephone systems centers in the state, including, but not limited to, recommendations for:(1) Minimum standards for emergency telephone systems and emergency communications centers;(2) Minimum standards for equipment used in any center receiving telephone calls of an emergency nature and dispatching emergency service providers in response to that call and which receives 911 moneys or has basic 911 service funded through its county commission; and(3) Minimum standards for education and training of all personnel in emergency communications centers.(b) A county commission may impose a fee upon consumers of local exchange service within that county for an enhanced emergency telephone system and associated electronic equipment and for the conversion of all rural routes to city-type addressing as provided in section three of this article. The fee revenues may only be used solely and directly for the capital, installation, administration, operation and maintenance costs of the enhanced emergency telephone system and of the conversion to city-type addressing and including the reasonable costs associated with establishing, equipping, furnishing, operating or maintaining a county answering point. Effective on July 1, 2006, all county enhanced emergency telephone system fees that are in effect as of July 1, 2006, and as such may later be modified by action of a county commission, shall be imposed upon in-state subscribers to voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service, as VoIP service is defined by the Federal Communications Commission of the United States. A nonbusiness VoIP service subscriber shall be considered in-state if the primary residence of the subscriber is located within West Virginia. A business subscriber shall be considered in-state if the site at which the service is primarily used is located within West Virginia. The Public Service Commission may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with the requirements of due process, issue and enforce orders, as well as adopt and enforce rules, dealing with matters concerning the imposition of county enhanced emergency telephone system fees upon VoIP service subscribers.(c) A county commission may contract with the telephone company or companies providing local exchange service within the county for the telephone company or companies to act as the billing agent or agents of the county commission for the billing of the fee imposed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The cost for the billing agent services may be included as a recurring maintenance cost of the enhanced emergency telephone system.Where a county commission has contracted with a telephone company to act as its billing agent for enhanced emergency telephone system fees, all competing local exchange telephone companies with customers in that county shall bill the enhanced emergency telephone system fees to its respective customers located in that county and shall remit the fee. It may deduct its respective costs for billing in the same manner as the acting billing agent for the enhanced emergency telephone system fee.(d) A county commission of any county with an emergency communications center or emergency telephone system may establish standards for alarm systems, including security, fire and medical alarms.(e) The books and records of all county answering points that benefit from the imposition of the local exchange service fees shall be subject to annual examination by the State Auditor's office.",

The state civil service commission shall prepare and prescribe, from time to time, the competitive examination to be given by the civil service commission of each such county. All competitive examinations shall be open to all applicants who have fulfilled the preliminary requirements specified in other sections of this article.Adequate public notice of the date, time and place of every competitive examination held under the provisions of this article, together with information as to the position to be filled, shall be given at least two weeks prior to such competitive examination. The commission shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations for permitting the presence of representatives of the press at any such competitive examination. The commission shall post, in a public place at its office, the eligible list, containing the names and grades of those who have passed such competitive examinations for positions as deputy sheriffs, under this article, and shall indicate thereon such appointments as may be made from said list.All applicants for appointment or promotion to any position as a deputy sheriff in any such county who have passed the competitive examination specified above shall, before being appointed or promoted, undergo a medical examination which shall be conducted under the supervision of a board composed of two doctors of medicine appointed for such purpose by the sheriff of the county. Such board must certify that an applicant is free from any bodily or mental defects, deformity or diseases which might incapacitate from the performance of the duties of the position desired and is physically fit to perform such duties before said applicant shall be appointed or promoted to any position. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, in the event the commission deems it expedient, the medical examination may be given prior to the competitive examination, and if the medical examination is not passed as aforesaid, the applicant shall not be admitted to the competitive examination.All deputies who are employed as deputies on the effective date of this article shall be considered to have been appointed under the provisions of this article, without regard to their age, provided they are not on said date sixty-five years of age or older, and without competitive examination or medical examination, and shall hold their positions in accordance therewith for one year from the effective date of this article.

Such deputies must complete such training program and must score a minimum of sixty points on a written examination in which one hundred points would be the highest possible score. The examination shall be given in accordance with rules and regulations to be promulgated by the civil service commission of the county.

The state civil service commission shall prepare and prescribe, from time to time, the competitive examination to be given by the civil service commission of each such county. All competitive examinations shall be open to all applicants who have fulfilled the preliminary requirements specified in other sections of this article.Adequate public notice of the date, time and place of every competitive examination held under the provisions of this article, together with information as to the position to be filled, shall be given at least two weeks prior to such competitive examination. The civil service commission in each county shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations for permitting the presence of representatives of the press at any such competitive examinations. Such commission shall post, in a public place at its office, the eligible list, containing the names and grades of those who have passed such competitive examinations for positions as correctional officer, under this article, and shall indicate thereon such appointments as may be made from said list.All applicants for appointment or promotion to any position as a correctional officer in any such county who have passed the competitive examination specified above shall, before being appointed or promoted, undergo a medical examination which shall be conducted under the supervision of a board composed of two doctors of medicine appointed for such purpose by the sheriff of the county. Such board must certify that an applicant is free from any bodily or mental defects, deformity or diseases which might incapacitate from the performance of the duties of the position desired and is physically fit to perform such duties before said applicant shall be appointed or promoted to any position. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, in the event the commission deems it expedient, the medical examination may be given prior to the competitive examination, and if the medical examination is not passed as aforesaid, the applicant shall not be admitted to the competitive examination.All correctional officers who are employed as correctional officers on the effective date of this article, shall be considered to have been appointed under the provisions of this article without regard to their age, and without competitive examination or medical examination, and shall hold their positions in accordance therewith for one year from the effective date of this article. The civil service commission shall, however, establish or prescribe a training program for correctional officers who are employed as such on the effective date of this article, giving due consideration to available training personnel and programs. Such correctional officers shall complete a two-hundred-hour basic correctional officer's training course as certified by the West Virginia department of corrections within a twelve-month period following appointment.However, persons who have (1) completed a basic correctional officers training course or equivalent within the past three years prior to appointment or (2) who have been employed as a correctional officer in a jail for three years out of the last five years prior to appointment may be certified as correctional officers without basic training if in the judgment of the commission such persons are otherwise qualified. A correctional officer failing to qualify under the provisions of this paragraph may be continued in his position at the discretion of the sheriff but in no event for a period of more than one year. Such person may be reexamined at the discretion of the civil service commission of the county and may qualify as provided in this paragraph.",

Upon the death of either the member or his or her beneficiary, the benefit shall continue as a life annuity to the survivor in an amount equal to fifty percent, sixty-six and two-thirds percent, seventy-five percent or one hundred percent of the amount paid while both were living as selected by the member. If the retiring member is married, the spouse shall sign a waiver of benefit rights if the beneficiary is to be other than the spouse.(2) Option B -- Contingent Joint and Survivor Annuity. -- A life annuity payable during the joint lifetime of the member and his or her beneficiary who must be a natural person with an insurable interest in the member's life. Upon the death of the member, the benefit shall continue as a life annuity to the beneficiary in an amount equal to fifty percent, sixty-six and two-thirds percent, seventy-five percent or one hundred percent of the amount paid while both were living as selected by the member. If the beneficiary dies first, the monthly amount of benefits may not be reduced, but shall be paid at the amount that was in effect before the death of the beneficiary. If the retiring member is married, the spouse shall sign a waiver of benefit rights if the beneficiary is to be other than the spouse.(3) Option C -- Ten Years Certain and Life Annuity. -- A life annuity payable during the member's lifetime but in any event for a minimum of ten years. If the member dies before the expiration of ten years, the remaining payments shall be made to a designated beneficiary, if any, or otherwise to the member's estate.(4) Option D -- Level Income Annuity. -- A life annuity payable monthly in an increased amount \"A\" from the time of retirement until the member is Social Security retirement age, and then a lesser amount \"B\" payable for the member's lifetime thereafter, with these amounts computed actuarially to satisfy the following two conditions:(A) Actuarial equivalence. -- The actuarial present value at the date of retirement of the member's annuity if taken in the normal form must equal the actuarial present value of the term life annuity in amount \"A\" plus the actual present value of the deferred life annuity in amount \"B\"; and(B) Level income. -- The amount \"A\" equals the amount \"B\" plus the amount of the member's estimated monthly Social Security primary insurance amount that would commence at the date amount \"B\" becomes payable. For this calculation, the primary insurance amount is estimated when the member applies for retirement, using Social Security law then in effect, using assumptions established by the board.(b) In the case of a member who has elected the options set forth in subdivisions(a)(1) or (2) of this section, and whose beneficiary dies prior to the member's death, the member may name an alternative beneficiary. If an alternative beneficiary is named within eighteen months following the death of the prior beneficiary, the benefit shall be adjusted to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit the member is receiving just after the death of the member's named beneficiary. If the election is not made until eighteen months after the death of the prior beneficiary, the amount shall be reduced so that it is only ninety percent of the actuarial equivalent of the benefit the member is receiving just after the death of the member's named beneficiary.(c) (1) In the case of a retired member who has elected an option set forth in subdivision (a)(1) or (2)of this section, and designated his or her spouse as beneficiary, upon divorce or annulment, the retirant may elect to change the retirement benefit options offered by those subdivisions to a life annuity in an amount adjusted on a fair basis to be of equal actuarial value of the annuity prospectively in effect relative to the retirant at the time the option is elected: Provided, That the retirant furnishes to the board satisfactory proof of entry of a final decree of divorce or annulment: Provided, however, That the retirant certifies under penalty of perjury that no qualified domestic relations order, final decree of divorce or other court order that would restrict the election is in effect: Provided further, That no cause of action against the board arises or may be maintained on the basis of having permitted the retirant to change the retirement benefit option pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.(2) Upon remarriage, a retirant may name the new spouse as an annuitant for any of the retirement benefit options offered by subdivision (a)(1) or (2) of this section: Provided, That the retirant shall furnish to the board proof of marriage: Provided, however, That the retirant certifies under penalty of perjury that no qualified domestic relations order, final decree of divorce or other court order that would restrict the designation is in effect: Provided further, That no cause of action against the board arises or may be maintained on the basis of having permitted the retirant to name a new spouse as annuitant for any of the survivorship retirement benefit options.

No member is eligible for more than one outstanding loan at any time. No loan may be made from the plan if the board determines that the loans constitute more than fifteen percent of the amortized cost value of the assets of the plan as of the last day of the preceding plan year. The board may discontinue the loans any time it determines that cash flow problems might develop as a result of the loans. Each loan shall be repaid through monthly installments over periods of six through sixty months and carry interest on the unpaid balance and an annual effective interest rate that is two hundred basis points higher than the most recent rate of interest used by the board for determining actuarial contributions levels: Provided, however, That interest charged shall be commercially reasonable in accordance with the provisions of Section 72(p)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and federal regulations issued thereunder. Monthly loan payments shall be calculated to be as nearly equal as possible with all but the final payment being an equal amount. An eligible member may make additional loan payments or pay off the entire loan balance at any time without incurring any interest penalty. Upon full payment of the loan, a member may apply for a subsequent loan after sixty days beginning the first day of the month following receipt of final payment.(b) If a withdrawal of accumulated contributions is payable to the borrower or his or her beneficiary before he or she repays the loan with interest, the loan balance due with interest to date shall be deducted from the withdrawal.(c) A member with an unpaid loan balance who wishes to retire or who becomes eligible to receive disability benefits under any provisions of this article may have the loan repaid in full by accepting retirement income or disability payments reduced by deducting from the actuarial reserve for the accrued benefit the amount of the unpaid balance plus accrued interest, if any, and then converting the remaining of the reserve to a monthly pension or disability benefit payable in the form of the annuity desired by the member: Provided, That if payment of the member's monthly retirement income or disability income is suspended or terminated for any reason, upon recommencement of the payments, the actuarial reduction in benefit may be recalculated for additional interest accruals, to the extent determined necessary and appropriate by the board.(d) A member who ceases service with an unpaid loan balance will no longer be a member when the unpaid loan balance, plus accrued interest, equals or exceeds the member's accumulated contributions.(e) The entire unpaid balance of any loan, and interest due thereon, shall at the option of the board become due and payable without further notice or demand upon the occurrence with respect to the borrowing member of any of the following events of default: (1) Any payment of principal and accrued interest on a loan remains unpaid after they become due and payable under the terms of the loan or after the grace period established in the discretion of the retirement board; (2) the borrowing member attempts to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors of his or her benefit under the retirement system; or (3) any other event of default set forth in rules promulgated by the board pursuant to the authority granted in section one, article ten-d, chapter five of this code: Provided, That any offset of an unpaid loan balance shall be made only at such time as the member is entitled to receive a distribution under the plan.(f) Loans shall be evidenced by such form of obligations and shall be made upon such additional terms as to default, prepayment, security, and otherwise as the board may determine.(g) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the loan program authorized by this section shall comply with the provisions of Section 72(p)(2) and Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code and the federal regulations issued thereunder.

The annual aggregate limit of assessments that may be levied against a parcel of real property within the district is five percent of the appraised value of the real property, including improvements, as shown in the property tax records and land books of the county in which the property is located. A resolution authorizing an assessment shall only be adopted after following the procedures set forth in this section.(b) A service assessment within a resort area district shall be authorized by the adoption of a resolution by the board.(c) The bylaws of a district shall provide the procedures not addressed in this section for the implementation of an assessment to pay the costs of a project or service:Provided, That the procedures must be consistent with constitutional standards and all other laws and rules of this state.(d) Fifty-one percent or more of the owners of real property to be benefitted by a project or service may petition the board to implement an assessment to pay the costs of the project or service.

If, as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a favorable vote of the property owners is required before the board authorizes the assessment, the notice of meeting shall also contain information required to enable the owners of real property within the district that will be subject to the assessment to vote on the assessment by mail or electronic means.(g) An assessment may not be authorized by the board if at the public meeting required by this section written protest is filed by at least 25 percent of the owners of the real property within the district to be benefitted by the proposed project or service and subject to the assessment. However, before an assessment proposed by the board on its own initiative as provided in subsection (d) of this section is authorized by the board, the proposal must also receive the favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting for the proposal by the owners of real property in the district that will be subject to the assessment. Voting at the meeting shall be in person or by proxy at the meeting, or by mailed ballot or electronic means received prior to the meeting. The voting rules set forth in §7-25-11(e) of this code apply to all voting on assessments. In the event of such protest, the proposed assessment in the same form may not be reconsidered by a board for a period of at least one year from the date of the public meeting.(h) At least 30 days prior to the date of the public meeting, the notice required by this section shall, using reasonable efforts, be mailed to the owners of real property to be assessed for a proposed project as provided in subsection (l) of this section, posted in multiple, conspicuous, public locations within the district and published as a Class II legal advertisement in compliance with the provisions of §59-3-1et seq. of this code. The publication area for the publication is the resort area district.(i) An affidavit of publication of the notice made by newspaper publisher, or a person authorized to do so on behalf of the publisher, and a copy of the notice shall be made part of the minutes of the board and spread on its records of the meeting described in the notice. The service of the notice upon all persons owning any interest in any real property located within the resort area district shall conclusively be determined to have been given upon completion of mailing as provided in subsection (l) of this section and the newspaper publication.(j) After the public meeting and before the board may adopt a resolution authorizing implementation of assessments, the board shall, using reasonable efforts, mail a true copy of the proposed resolution authorizing implementation of an assessment to the owners of real property in the resort area district as provided in subsection (l) of this section.(k) A board shall make available to the owners of real property within the district a list of all owners of real property within the district for the purposes of enabling the owners of real property to solicit support for a petition proposing or a protest against an assessment.(l) For purposes of the mailing of each notice to owners of real property required by this section, reasonable efforts shall be made to mail the notice to all owners of real property required to receive notice under this section using the real property tax records and land books of the county in which the district is located and any lists maintained by a resort operator or homeowners association within the district. The notice shall be also mailed to each president of a homeowners association, if any, located within a district which has registered with a resort operator to receive the information.
