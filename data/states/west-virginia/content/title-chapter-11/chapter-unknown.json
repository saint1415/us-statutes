The Legislature does not intend by this article to implement the reappraisal as conducted under articles one-a and one-b of this chapter nor does it intend to affect tax revenue in any manner.(c) The Legislature finds that requiring the valuation of property to occur in three-year cycles with an annual adjustment of assessments as to those properties for which a change in value is discovered shall not violate the equal and uniform provision of section one, article ten of the West Virginia Constitution, the Legislature further finding that such three-year cycle and annual adjustment are an integral and indispensable part of a systematic review of all properties in order to achieve equality of assessed valuation within and among the counties of this state.

Unless the taxpayer against whom a jeopardy assessment is made posts the required security and petitions for reassessment within 20 days after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such assessment shall become final: Provided, That upon written request of the taxpayer made within the 20-day period, showing reasonable cause therefor, the Tax Commissioner may grant an extension of time not to exceed 30 additional days within which such petition may be filed.

Subject to the exemptions, exceptions and requirements set forth in section three of this article, the $30 tax shall be paid each and every time there is an issuance, reissuance or reinstatement of a business registration certificate, along with any applicable delinquent fees, interest, penalties and additions to tax: Provided, however That the $4,000 or less gross income exemption set forth in subdivision (1), subsection (d), section three of this article does not apply.(b) Revocation, cancellation or suspension of certificate. -–(1) The Tax Commissioner may cancel, revoke or suspend a business registration certificate at any time during a registration period if:(A) The registrant filed an application for a business registration certificate, or an application for renewal thereof, that was false or fraudulent.(B) The registrant willfully refused or neglected to file a tax return or to report information required by the Tax Commissioner for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter.(C) The registrant willfully refused or neglected to pay any tax, additions to tax, penalties or interest, or any part thereof, when they became due and payable under this chapter, determined with regard to any authorized extension of time for payment.(D) The registrant neglected to pay over to the Tax Commissioner on or before its due date, determined with regard to any authorized extension of time for payment, any tax imposed by this chapter which the registrant collects from any person and holds in trust for this state.(E) The registrant abused the privilege afforded to it by article fifteen or fifteen-a of this chapter to be exempt from payment of the taxes imposed by such articles on some or all of the registrant's purchases for use in business upon issuing to the vendor a properly executed exemption certificate, by failing to timely pay use tax on taxable purchase for use in business or by failing to either pay the tax or give a properly executed exemption certificate to the vendor.(F) The registrant has failed to pay in full delinquent personal property taxes owing for the calendar year.(2) On or after July 1, 2010, a prospective registrant or a former registrant for which a business registration certificate has been suspended, canceled or revoked pursuant to the provisions of this article may apply for a new business registration certificate or for reinstatement of a suspended business registration certificate upon payment of all outstanding delinquent fees, taxes, interest, additions to tax and penalties, in addition to payment to the Tax Commissioner of a penalty in the amount of $100. The Tax Commissioner may issue a new business registration certificate or reinstate a suspended business registration certificate if the prospective or former registrant has provided security acceptable to and authorized by the Tax Commissioner, payable to the Tax Commissioner, sufficient to secure all delinquent fees, taxes, interest, additions to tax and penalties owed by the prospective registrant. The Tax Commissioner may issue a new business registration certificate or reinstate a suspended business registration certificate if the prospective or former registrant has entered into a payment plan approved by the Tax Commissioner by which liability for all delinquent fees, taxes, interest, additions to tax and penalties will be paid in due course and without significant delay. Failure of any registrant to comply with a payment plan pursuant to this provision shall be grounds for immediate suspension or revocation of the registrant's business registration certificate.(3) On and after July 1, 2010, a prospective registrant or a former registrant for which a business registration certificate has been suspended, canceled or revoked pursuant to the provisions of any article of this code other than this article may apply for a new business registration certificate or for reinstatement of a suspended business registration certificate, only if the prospective or former registrant has complied with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for renewal, issuance or reinstatement of the business registration certificate and upon payment to the Tax Commissioner of a penalty in the amount of $100.(4) Except pursuant to exceptions specified in this code, before canceling, revoking or suspending any business registration certificate, the Tax Commissioner shall give written notice of his or her intent to suspend, revoke or cancel the business registration certificate of the taxpayer, the reason for the suspension, revocation or cancellation and the effective date of the cancellation, revocation or suspension. Written notice shall be served on the taxpayer in accordance with section five-e, article ten of this chapter not less than twenty days prior to the effective date of the cancellation, revocation or suspension. Acceptance of service of notice shall be deemed to have occurred if completed as set forth in section five-e, article ten of this chapter. The taxpayer may appeal cancellation, revocation or suspension of its business registration certificate by filing a petition for appeal with the Office of Tax Appeals within twenty days immediately succeeding receipt of the service of notice to suspend, revoke or cancel the business registration certificate. The filing of a petition for appeal does not stay the effective date of the suspension, revocation or cancellation. A stay may be granted only after a hearing is held on a motion to stay filed by the registrant upon finding that state revenues will not be jeopardized by the granting of the stay. The Tax Commissioner may, in his or her discretion and upon such terms as he or she may specify, agree to stay the effective date of the cancellation, revocation or suspension until another date certain.(5) On or before July 1, 2005, the Tax Commissioner shall propose for promulgation legislative rules establishing ancillary procedures for the Tax Commissioner's suspension of business registration certificates for failure to pay delinquent personal property taxes pursuant to paragraph (F), subdivision (1) of this section. The rules shall at a minimum establish any additional requirements for the provision of notice deemed necessary by the Tax Commissioner to meet requirements of law; establish protocols for the communication and verification of information exchanged between the Tax Commissioner, sheriffs and others; and establish fees to be assessed against delinquent taxpayers that shall be deposited into a special fund which is hereby created and expended for general tax administration by the Tax Division of the Department of Revenue and for operation of the Tax Division. Upon authorization of the Legislature, the rules shall have the same force and effect as if set forth herein. No provision of this subdivision may be construed to restrict in any manner the authority of the Tax Commissioner to suspend such certificates for failure to pay delinquent personal property taxes under paragraph (C) or (F), subdivision (1) of this section or under any other provision of this code prior to the authorization of the rules.(c) Revocation, cancellation or suspension due to delinquent personal property tax. -- The Tax Commissioner may revoke, cancel or suspend a business registration certificate when informed in writing, signed by the county sheriff, that personal property owned by a registrant and used in conjunction with the business activity of the a registrant is subject to delinquent property taxes. The Tax Commissioner shall forthwith notify the registrant that the commissioner will revoke, cancel or suspend the registrant's business registration certificate unless information is provided evidencing that the taxes due are either exonerated or paid.(d) Refusal to issue, revocation, suspension and refusal to renew business registration certificate of alter ego, nominee or instrumentality of a business that has previously been the subject of a lawful refusal to issue, revocation, suspension or refuse to renew. -–(1) The Tax Commissioner may refuse to issue a business registration certificate, or may revoke a business registration certificate or may suspend a business registration certificate or may refuse to renew a business registration certificate for any business determined by the Tax Commissioner to be an alter ego, nominee or instrumentality of a business that has previously been the subject of a lawful refusal to issue a business registration certificate or of a lawful revocation, suspension or refusal to renew a business registration certificate pursuant to this section, and for which the business registration certificate has not been lawfully reinstated or reissued.(2) For purposes of this section, a business is presumed to be an alter ego, nominee or instrumentality of another business or other businesses if:(A) More than twenty percent of the real assets or more than twenty percent of the operating assets or more than twenty percent of the tangible personal property of one business are or have been transferred to the other business or businesses, or are or have been used in the operations of the other business or businesses, or more than twenty percent of the real assets or more than twenty percent of the operating assets or more than twenty percent of the tangible personal property of one business are or have been used to collateralize or secure debts or obligations of the other business or businesses;(B) Ownership of the businesses is so configured that the attribution rules of either Internal Revenue Code section 267 or Internal Revenue Code section 318 would apply to cause ownership of the businesses to be attributed to the same person or entity; or(C) Substantive control of the businesses is held or retained by the same person, entity or individual, directly or indirectly, or through attribution under paragraph (B) of this subdivision.",

The Director of the Development Office shall approve the synthetic fuel-producing county's plan for use if the plan for use reasonably conforms to the requirements of this section and the rules promulgated with relation thereto.(C) If the county's plan is approved, the Director of the Development Office may authorize a grant of money out of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund to the county to be used by the county as specified in the approved plan for use.(D) The Director of the Development Office may authorize distribution of any amount encumbered for the use of the county and carried over from a prior period in accordance with applicable plans for use previously approved.(E) The Director of the Development Office may authorize encumbrances for any synthetic fuel-producing county of moneys in the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund, up to the amount of the county's provisional share for the fiscal year, for one or more qualified uses specified in the county's plan for use if the county's approved plan for use of the moneys sets forth a qualified use for the county's provisional share over a period of several fiscal years or a qualified use of the moneys calling for accumulation and distribution to the county in one or more subsequent fiscal years. Encumbered funds may carry over to succeeding fiscal years and may be used to accumulate reserves over a period of time for use by the county.(F) In no case may an amount distributed to a synthetic fuel-producing county exceed the amount of a county's provisional share for the fiscal year plus the amount of moneys encumbered in the fund for the use of the particular county and carried over from a prior period.(2) The Director of the Development Office may approve distributions of a county's provisional share of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund for use as the county's share for state or federal matching funds programs so long as, in the aggregate, ninety percent of the funds distributed to the county out of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund are used for infrastructure improvement and ten percent of the funds distributed to the county out of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund are used for economic development: Provided, That no county may use any amount distributed out of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund as money to be matched under the funds matching program authorized by subsection (b), section three, article two, chapter five-b of this code.(3) Repooling. -–(A) Any synthetic fuel-producing county that has failed to have its plan, or amended and resubmitted plan or plans, approved by the Director of the Development Office for a period of eighteen months immediately subsequent to the initial plan submission date shall lose its entitlement to the provisional share of revenues deposited in the fund and attributable to the fiscal year to which that plan relates and the provisional share that would have been attributable to that county for that fiscal year shall be pooled with all other receipts in the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund attributable to revenues for the fiscal year during which the eighteen-month period ends and shall then be reallocated equally to all synthetic fuel-producing counties as part of the provisional share of each, as if the repooled moneys were tax revenues deposited into the fund during the fiscal year in which the eighteen-month period ended. For purposes of this subsection, the \"initial plan submission date\" means the earlier of: (i) The required submission date, as prescribed by the Director of the Development Office, for the initial plan for use of the county's provisional share of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund for the fiscal year, with such extensions of time to file as may be authorized under rules promulgated by the Director of the Development Office; or (ii) the actual date of submission of the initial plan for the fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"initial plan\" means the first plan for use that was submitted, or that should have been submitted, by a county for the fiscal year, before the submission of any amended, revised or resubmitted plan by the county for that fiscal year.(B) Any synthetic fuel-producing county which fails to timely submit a plan for use of its provisional share of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund, with such extensions of time to file as may be authorized under rules promulgated by the Director of the Development Office, shall lose its entitlement to its provisional share of revenues deposited in the fund and attributable to that fiscal year and the provisional share that would have been attributable to that county for that year shall be pooled with all other receipts in the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund attributable to revenues for the fiscal year and shall be reallocated equally among the remaining synthetic fuel-producing counties other than the county or counties that have failed to timely file the plan for use and shall be made available for distribution to those remaining counties, as part of their provisional share for the fiscal year.(C) Funds encumbered pursuant to approval of the Director of the Development Office under this subsection shall not be subject to repooling: Provided, That if the Director of the Development Office determines that moneys previously distributed to a county out of the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund have not been used as required under the approved plan for the county or determines that previously distributed moneys derived from encumbered funds have not been used for the qualified purpose for which the encumbrance was originally approved or if there appears to be a reasonable probability that encumbered funds will not be used for that qualified purpose, the Director of the Development Office may revoke the encumbrance of any funds of that synthetic fuel-producing county remaining in the fund and repool the funds so encumbered for reallocation to all synthetic fuel-producing counties. The Director of the Development Office may, in the director's discretion, give the county an opportunity to cure the nonqualified use of moneys derived from the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund or to submit an alternative plan for use of the encumbered funds which may be approved by the director if that plan complies with the requirements of this section.(g) Promulgation of rules by the director of the Development Office authorized. -– The Director of the Development Office, in his or her discretion, may promulgate an emergency rule as provided in article three, chapter twenty-nine-a of this code that clarifies, explains or implements the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Program, distribution of moneys out of or encumbrance of moneys in the Synthetic Fuel-Producing Counties Grant Fund.

For all natural resources, “gross value” is to be reported as follows:(A) For natural resources severed or processed (or both severed and processed) and sold during a reporting period, gross value is the gross proceeds received or receivable by the taxpayer.(B) In a transaction involving related parties, gross value shall not be less than the fair market value for natural resources of similar grade and quality.(C) In the absence of a sale, gross value shall be the fair market value for natural resources of similar grade and quality.(D) If severed natural resources are purchased for the purpose of processing and resale, the gross value is the amount received or receivable during the reporting period reduced by the amount paid or payable to the taxpayer actually severing the natural resource. If natural resources are severed outside the State of West Virginia and brought into the State of West Virginia by the taxpayer for the purpose of processing and sale, the gross value is the amount received or receivable during the reporting period reduced by the fair market value of natural resources of similar grade and quality and in the same condition immediately preceding the processing of the natural resources in this state.(E) If severed natural resources are purchased for the purpose of processing and consumption, the gross value is the fair market value of processed natural resources of similar grade and quality reduced by the amount paid or payable to the taxpayer actually severing the natural resource. If severed natural resources are severed outside the State of West Virginia and brought into the State of West Virginia by the taxpayer for the purpose of processing and consumption, the gross value is the fair market value of processed natural resources of similar grade and quality reduced by the fair market value of natural resources of similar grade and quality and in the same condition immediately preceding the processing of the natural resources.(F) In all instances, the gross value shall be reduced by the amount of any federal energy tax imposed upon the taxpayer after June 1, 1993, but shall not be reduced by any state or federal taxes, royalties, sales commissions or any other expense.(G) For natural gas, gross value is the value of the natural gas at the wellhead immediately preceding transportation and transmission.(H) For limestone or sandstone quarried or mined, gross value is the value of such stone immediately upon severance from the earth.(7) “Mining” includes not merely the extraction of ores or minerals from the ground, but also those treatment processes necessary or incidental thereto.(8) “Natural resources” means all forms of minerals including, but not limited to, rock, stone, limestone, coal, shale, gravel, sand, clay, natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids which are contained in or on the soils or waters of this state and includes standing timber. For the purposes of the severance tax levied in this article, salt produced solely for human consumption as food is not classified as a mineral subject to this tax.(9) “Processed” or “processing” as applied to:(A) Oil and natural gas shall not include any conversion or refining process; and(B) Limestone or sandstone quarried or mined shall not include any treatment process or transportation after the limestone or sandstone is severed from the earth.(10) “Related parties” means two or more persons, organizations or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests. Control exists if a contract or lease, either written or oral, is entered into whereby one party mines or processes natural resources owned or held by another party and the owner or lessor participates in the severing, processing or marketing of the natural resources or receives any value other than an arm’s length passive royalty interest. In the case of related parties, the Tax Commissioner may apportion or allocate the receipts between or among such persons, organizations or businesses if he or she determines that such apportionment or allocation is necessary to more clearly reflect gross value.(11) “Severing” or “severed” means the physical removal of the natural resources from the earth or waters of this state by any means:Provided, That “severing” or “severed” shall not include the removal of natural gas from underground storage facilities into which the natural gas has been mechanically injected following its initial removal from earth:Provided, however, That “severing” or “severed” oil and natural gas shall not include any separation process of oil or natural gas commonly employed to obtain marketable natural resource products.(12) “Stock” includes shares in an association, joint-stock company or corporation.(13) “Taxpayer” means and includes any individual, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation, receiver, trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, fiduciary or representative of any kind engaged in the business of severing or processing (or both severing and processing) natural resources in this state for sale or use. In instances where contracts (either oral or written) are entered into whereby persons, organizations or businesses are engaged in the business of severing or processing (or both severing and processing) a natural resource but do not obtain title to or do not have an economic interest therein, the party who owns the natural resource immediately after its severance or has an economic interest therein is the taxpayer.(d)Specific definitions for persons providing health care items or services. —“Behavioral health services” means services provided for the care and treatment of persons with mental illness, mental retardation, developmental disabilities or alcohol or drug abuse problems in an inpatient, residential or outpatient setting, including, but not limited to, habilitative or rehabilitative interventions or services and cooking, cleaning, laundry and personal hygiene services provided for such care:Provided, That gross receipts derived from providing behavioral health services that are included in the provider’s measure of tax under article twenty-seven of this chapter shall not be include in that provider’s measure of tax under this article. The amendment to this definition in the year 2004 is intended to clarify the intent of the Legislature as to the activities that qualify as behavioral health services, and this clarification shall be applied retrospectively to the effective date of the amendment to this section in which the definition of “behavioral health services” was originally provided as enacted during the first extraordinary session of the Legislature in the year 1993.",

Effective July 1, 1997, and thereafter, ten percent of the tax attributable to the severance of oil and gas imposed by section three-a of this article is hereby dedicated for the use and benefit of counties and municipalities within this state and shall be distributed to the counties and municipalities as provided in this section.

The Tax Commissioner is also hereby granted plenary power and authority to promulgate such other reasonable rules as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section.(d) In order to provide a procedure for the distribution of seventy-five percent of the dedicated tax for counties and municipalities on oil and gas to the oil and gas producing counties, the special fund known as the oil and gas county revenue fund established in State Treasurer's office by chapter two hundred forty-two, acts of the Legislature, 1995 regular session, as amended and reenacted in the subsequent act of the Legislature, is hereby continued. In order to provide a procedure for the distribution of the remaining twenty-five percent of the dedicated tax for counties and municipalities on oil and gas to all counties and municipalities of the state, without regard to oil and gas having been produced in those counties or municipalities, the special fund known as the all counties and municipalities revenue fund established in State Treasurer's office by chapter two hundred forty-two, acts of the Legislature, 1995 regular session, as amended and reenacted in the subsequent act of the Legislature, is hereby redesignated as the \"all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund\" and is hereby continued.Seventy-five percent of the dedicated tax for counties and municipalities on oil and gas shall be deposited in the oil and gas county revenue fund and twenty-five percent of this dedicated tax on oil and gas shall be deposited in the all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund, from time to time, as the proceeds are received by the Tax Commissioner. The moneys in the funds shall be distributed to the respective counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys in the manner set forth in subsection (e) of this section.(e) The moneys in the oil and gas county revenue fund and the moneys in the all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund shall be allocated among and distributed annually to the counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys by the State Treasurer in the manner specified in this section. On or before each distribution date, the State Treasurer shall determine the total amount of moneys in each fund which will be available for distribution to the respective counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys on that distribution date. The amount to which an oil and gas producing county is entitled from the oil and gas county revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section, and the amount to which every county and municipality shall be entitled from the all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with subsection (g) of this section. After determining, as set forth in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the amount each county and municipality is entitled to receive from the respective fund or funds, a warrant of the State Auditor for the sum due to the county or municipality shall issue and a check drawn thereon making payment of the sum shall thereafter be distributed to the county or municipality.(f) The amount to which an oil and gas producing county is entitled from the oil and gas county revenue fund shall be determined by:(1) In the case of moneys derived from tax on the severance of gas:(A) Dividing the total amount of moneys in the fund derived from tax on the severance of gas then available for distribution by the total volume of cubic feet of gas extracted in this state during the preceding year; and(B) Multiplying the quotient thus obtained by the number of cubic feet of gas taken from the ground in the county during the preceding year; and(2) In the case of moneys derived from tax on the severance of oil:(A) Dividing the total amount of moneys in the fund derived from tax on the severance of oil then available for distribution by the total number of barrels of oil extracted in this state during the preceding year; and(B) Multiplying the quotient thus obtained by the number of barrels of oil taken from the ground in the county during the preceding year.(g) The amount to which each county and municipality is entitled from the all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection \"population\" means the population as determined by the most recent decennial census taken under the authority of the United States:(1) The State Treasurer shall first apportion the total amount of moneys available in the all counties and municipalities oil and gas revenue fund by multiplying the total amount in the fund by the percentage which the population of each county bears to the total population of the state. The amount thus apportioned for each county is the county's \"base share\".(2) Each county's base share shall then be subdivided into two portions. One portion is determined by multiplying the base share by that percentage which the total population of all unincorporated areas within the county bears to the total population of the county, and the other portion is determined by multiplying the base share by that percentage which the total population of all municipalities within the county bears to the total population of the county. The former portion shall be paid to the county and the latter portion shall be the \"municipalities' portion\" of the county's base share. The percentage of the latter portion to which each municipality in the county is entitled shall be determined by multiplying the total of the latter portion by the percentage which the population of each municipality within the county bears to the total population of all municipalities within the county.(h) Moneys distributed to any county or municipality under the provisions of this section, from either or both special funds, shall be deposited in the county or municipal general fund and may be expended by the county commission or governing body of the municipality for such purposes as the county commission or governing body shall determine to be in the best interest of its respective county or municipality:Provided, That in counties with population in excess of two hundred thousand, at least seventy-five percent of the funds received from the oil and gas county revenue fund shall be apportioned to and expended within the oil and gas producing area or areas of the county, the oil and gas producing areas of each county to be determined generally by the State Tax Commissioner:Provided, however, That the moneys distributed to any county or municipality under the provisions of this section shall not be budgeted for personal services in an amount to exceed one fourth of the total amount of the moneys.(i) On or before March 28, 1997, and each March 28 thereafter, each county commission or governing body of a municipality receiving any such moneys shall submit to the Tax Commissioner on forms provided by the Tax Commissioner a special budget, detailing how the moneys are to be spent during the subsequent fiscal year. The budget shall be followed in expending the moneys unless a subsequent budget is approved by the State Tax Commissioner. All unexpended balances remaining in the county or municipality general fund at the close of a fiscal year shall remain in the General Fund and may be expended by the county or municipality without restriction.(j) On or before December 15, 1996, and each December 15 thereafter, the Tax Commissioner shall deliver to the clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates a consolidated report of the budgets, created by subsection (i) of this section, for all county commissions and municipalities as of July 15, of the current year.(k) The State Tax Commissioner shall retain for the benefit of the state from the dedicated tax attributable to the severance of oil and gas the amount of $35,000 annually as a fee for the administration of the additional tax by the Tax Commissioner.",

The tax imposed by this subsection is in addition to the tax imposed by section three of this article, and this additional tax is referred to in this section as the \"additional tax on coal\".(b) This additional tax on coal is imposed pursuant to the provisions of section six-a, article ten of the West Virginia Constitution. Seventy-five percent of the net proceeds of this additional tax on coal shall be distributed by the State Treasurer in the manner specified in this section to the various counties of this state in which the coal upon which this additional tax is imposed was located at the time it was severed from the ground.

In addition to the reports and other information required under the provisions of this article and the tonnage reports required to be filed under the provisions of section seventy-seven, article two, chapter twenty-two-a of this code, the Tax Commissioner is hereby granted plenary power and authority to promulgate reasonable rules requiring the furnishing by producers of such additional information as may be necessary to compute the allocation required under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section. The Tax Commissioner is also hereby granted plenary power and authority to promulgate such other reasonable rules as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section: Provided, That notwithstanding any language contained in this code to the contrary, the gross amount of additional tax on coal collected under this article shall be paid over and distributed without the application of any credits against the tax imposed by this section.(d) In order to provide a procedure for the distribution of seventy-five percent of the net proceeds of the additional tax on coal to the coal-producing counties, the special fund known as the \"county coal revenue fund\" established in the State Treasurer’s office by chapter one hundred sixty-two, acts of the Legislature, 1985 regular session, as amended and reenacted in subsequent acts of the Legislature, is hereby continued. In order to provide a procedure for the distribution of the remaining twenty-five percent of the net proceeds of the additional tax on coal to all counties and municipalities of the state, without regard to coal having been produced therein, the special fund known as the \"all counties and municipalities revenue fund\" established in the State Treasurer’s office by chapter one hundred sixty-two, acts of the Legislature, 1985 regular session, as amended and reenacted in subsequent acts of the Legislature, is hereby redesignated as the \"all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund\" and is hereby continued.Seventy-five percent of the net proceeds of such additional tax on coal shall be deposited in the county coal revenue fund and twenty-five percent of the net proceeds shall be deposited in the all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund, from time to time, as the proceeds are received by the Tax Commissioner. The moneys in the funds shall be distributed to the respective counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys in the manner set forth in subsection (e) of this section.(e) The moneys in the county coal revenue fund and the moneys in the all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund shall be allocated among and distributed quarterly to the counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys by the State Treasurer in the manner specified in this section. On or before each distribution date, the State Treasurer shall determine the total amount of moneys in each fund which will be available for distribution to the respective counties and municipalities entitled to the moneys on that distribution date. The amount to which a coal-producing county is entitled from the county coal revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section, and the amount to which every county and municipality is entitled from the all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with subsection (g) of this section. After determining as set forth in subsection (f) and subsection (g) of this section the amount each county and municipality is entitled to receive from the respective fund or funds, a warrant of the State Auditor for the sum due to each county or municipality shall issue and a check drawn thereon making payment of such amount shall thereafter be distributed to each such county or municipality.(f) The amount to which a coal-producing county is entitled from the county coal revenue fund shall be determined by: (1) Dividing the total amount of moneys in the fund then available for distribution by the total number of tons of coal mined in this state during the preceding quarter; and (2) multiplying the quotient thus obtained by the number of tons of coal removed from the ground in the county during the preceding quarter.(g) The amount to which each county and municipality is entitled from the all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection \"population\" means the population as determined by the most recent decennial census taken under the authority of the United States:(1) The treasurer shall first apportion the total amount of moneys available in the all counties and municipalities coal revenue fund by multiplying the total amount in the fund by the percentage which the population of each county bears to the total population of the state.

The former portion shall be paid to the county and the latter portion is the \"municipalities\" portion\" of the county’s base share. The percentage of the latter portion to which each municipality in the county is entitled shall be determined by multiplying the total of the latter portion by the percentage which the population of each municipality within the county bears to the total population of all municipalities within the county.(h) All counties and municipalities shall create a \"coal severance tax revenue fund\" which shall be the depository for moneys distributed to any county or municipality under the provisions of this section, from either or both special funds. Moneys in the coal severance tax revenue fund, in compliance with subsection (i) of this section, may be expended by the county commission or governing body of the municipality for such public purposes as the county commission or governing body shall determine to be in the best interest of the people of its respective county or municipality.(i) All unexpended balances remaining in coal severance tax revenue fund at the close of a fiscal year shall be reappropriated to the budget of the county commission or governing body for the subsequent fiscal year. The reappropriation shall be entered as an amendment to the new budget and submitted to the Tax Commissioner on or before July 15, of the current budget year.(j) The State Tax Commissioner shall retain for the benefit of the state from the additional taxes on coal collected the amount of $35,000 annually as a fee for the administration of such additional tax by the Tax Commissioner.",

Said fund shall have separate accounting for those health care providers as set forth in articles four-b and four-c, chapter nine of this code.(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, for the remainder of fiscal year 1993 and for each succeeding fiscal year, no expenditures from taxes collected from providers of health care items or services are authorized except in accordance with appropriations by the Legislature.(c) The amount of taxes on the privilege of severing timber collected under section three-b of this article, including any interest, additions to tax and penalties collected under article ten of this chapter, less the amount of allowable refunds and any interest payable with respect to such refunds, shall be paid into a special revenue account in the State Treasury to be appropriated by the Legislature for purposes of the Division of Forestry.(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, beginning January 1, 2009, there is hereby dedicated an annual amount not to exceed $4 million from annual collections of the tax imposed by section three-d of this article to be deposited into the West Virginia Infrastructure Fund, created in section nine, article fifteen-a, chapter thirty-one of this code.(e) Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Tax Commissioner shall pay from the taxes imposed in section three-d of this article, on October 1, of each year, to the county economic development entities, as this term is defined in this subsection, or county commissions as provided in subsections (f) through (h) of this section, an amount in the aggregate not to exceed $4 million per fiscal year: Provided, That on July 1, 2012, the Tax Commissioner shall deposit the taxes imposed in section three-d of this article into a special revenue fund, which is hereby created in the State Treasurer's Office and known as the Coalbed Methane Gas Distribution Fund: Provided, however, That such deposit of taxes shall not exceed in the aggregate $4 million per fiscal year and moneys therein shall be distributed by the State Treasurer pursuant to this section. Prior to making any such payment the commissioner shall deduct the amount of refunds lawfully paid and administrative costs authorized by this code. All moneys distributed to the West Virginia Infrastructure Fund pursuant to this section prior to July 1, 2011, shall be returned to the Tax Commissioner and distributed to the county economic development entities, as this term is defined in this subsection, or county commissions as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, the term \"county economic development entity\" refers to a county economic development authority established pursuant to article twelve, chapter seven of this code or if a county does not have a county economic development authority established pursuant to article twelve, chapter seven of this code, an entity designated by resolution of the county commission of the county as the lead entity for economic development activities for the purpose of encouraging economic development in the county which entity may be, but is not limited to being, redevelopment authorities created pursuant to article eighteen, chapter sixteen of this code; county economic development corporations; regional economic development councils, corporations or partnerships.(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, prior to the deposit of the proceeds of the tax on coalbed methane with each, county economic development entity or county commission pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Tax Commissioner shall undertake the following calculations:(1) Seventy-five percent of the moneys to be deposited shall be provisionally allocated for the various counties of this state in which the coalbed methane was produced; and(2) The remaining twenty-five percent of the moneys to be deposited shall be provisionally allocated to the various counties of this state in which no coalbed methane was produced for projects in accordance with subsection (h) of this section.(3) Moneys shall be provisionally allocated to each coalbed methane producing county in direct proportion to the amount of tax revenues derived from coalbed methane production in the county.(4) Moneys shall be provisionally allocated to each coalbed methane nonproducing county equally.(5) Portional adjustments.(A) If, for any year, a coalbed methane producing county's share of money provisionally allocated to that county is computed to be an amount that is less than the amount provisionally allocated to each of the coalbed methane nonproducing counties, then for purposes of the computations set forth in this subsection, that coalbed methane producing county shall be redesignated a coalbed methane nonproducing county. The money that has been provisionally allocated to that coalbed methane producing county out of the seventy-five percent portion specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be subtracted out of the seventy-five percent portion specified in that subdivision and added to the twenty-five percent portion specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection.(B) When the adjustment specified in paragraph (A), of this subdivision has been made for each coalbed methane producing county that has been redesignated as a coalbed methane nonproducing county, then the Tax Department shall finalize the calculations of the amounts to be made available for distribution to the respective county economic development entity or county commission of the coalbed methane producing counties that have not been redesignated as coalbed methane nonproducing counties under paragraph (A) of this subdivision as follows: The amount remaining in the provisional seventy-five percent portion specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (A) of this subdivision, shall be allocated, in direct proportion to the amount that tax revenues derived from coalbed methane production in each such county not redesignated as a coalbed methane nonproducing county bears to the total amount of tax revenues derived from coalbed methane production in all coalbed methane producing counties that have not been redesignated as a coalbed methane nonproducing county.(C) The Tax Commissioner shall then finalize the calculation of the total amount in the twenty-five percent portion specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (A) of this subdivision equally among the coalbed methane nonproducing counties.(D) The Tax Commissioner, upon completing the calculation of the total amount of tax to be distributed to all coalbed methane producing counties and to all coalbed methane nonproducing counties, shall deposit an amount equal to the amount so calculated in the Coalbed Methane Gas Distribution Fund, subject to the limitations set forth in this section.(g) In no case may the total amount distributed in any fiscal year to the aggregate of all coalbed methane producing counties and all coalbed methane nonproducing counties calculated by the Tax Commissioner exceed the total amount of tax on coalbed methane authorized to be remitted to the county economic development entities and county commissions pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.(h) Distribution of coalbed methane severance tax to county economic development entities or county commissions is subject to the following:(1) If the amount determined pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section for a county is more than $10,000, the State Treasurer shall distribute the amount determined for that county to the county economic development entity. The State Treasurer is hereby authorized to distribute accumulated but undistributed moneys from fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 to each county economic development entity.(2) Each county economic development entity shall use such funds for economic development projects and infrastructure projects.(3) For purposes of this section:(A) \"Economic development project\" means a project in the state which is likely to foster economic growth and development in the area in which the project is developed for commercial, industrial, community improvement or preservation or other proper purposes.(B) \"Infrastructure project\" means a project in the state which is likely to foster infrastructure improvements and covers post mining land use, water or wastewater facilities, stormwater systems, steam, gas, telephone and telecommunications, broadband development, electric lines and installations, roads, bridges, railroad spurs, drainage and flood control facilities, industrial park development, road or buildings that promote job creation and retention.(4) Prior to expending any coalbed methane severance tax moneys, each county economic development entity must obtain the approval of its respective county commission, or the county commission or commissions representing the county or counties where the economic development or infrastructure project will be situate if the county economic development entity is regional and encompasses more than one county, in writing for the purpose of such expenditure.(5) A county commission or county economic development entity may not use funds distributed to it pursuant to subsections (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section for the purposes of paying wages to any employee of the county or any employee of a county economic development entity.(6) If the amount determined pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section for a county is $10,000 or less, the State Treasurer shall distribute the amount determined for that county to the county commission. The county commission may then use the funds to offset its regional jail costs, costs of any community corrections programs in which it participates, expenses of a volunteer fire department that provides service within its county or expenses of any library that provides services within its county.(i) On or before December 1, 2013, and December 1 of each year thereafter, the county economic development entity as defined in this section or county commission receiving a distribution of funds under this section shall deliver to the Joint Committee on Government and Finance a written report setting forth the specific projects for which those funds were expended during the next preceding fiscal year, a detailed account of those expenditures and a showing that the expenditures were made for the purposes required by this section.(j) An audit of any funds distributed under this section may be authorized at any time by the Joint Committee on Government and Finance to be conducted by the Legislative Auditor at no cost to the county economic development entity or county commission audited.",

Brewer or manufacturer may be used interchangeably throughout this article. A brewer may obtain only one brewer's license for its nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer.(3) \"Brewpub\" means a place of manufacture of nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer owned by a resident brewer, subject to federal and state regulations and rules, a portion of which premises is designated for retail sales of nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer by the resident brewer owning the brewpub.(4) \"Class A retail license\" means a retail license permitting the retail sale of liquor at a freestanding liquor retail outlet, licensed pursuant to §60-1-1et seq. of this code.(5) \"Class B retail license\" means a retail license permitting the retail sale of liquor at a mixed retail liquor outlet licensed pursuant to §60-1-1et seq. of this code.(6) \"Commissioner\" means the West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Administration Commissioner.(7) \"Distributor\" means and includes any person jobbing or distributing nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer to retailers at wholesale and whose warehouse and chief place of business is within this state.

Any trust licensed as a distributor or any trust that is an owner of a distributor licensee, and the trustee or other persons in active control of the activities of the trust relating to the distributor license, is liable for acts of the trust or its beneficiaries relating to the distributor license that are unlawful acts or violations of §11-16-1et seq. of this code notwithstanding the liability of trustees in §44D-10-1et seq. of this code.(8) \"Franchise agreement\" means the written agreement between a brewer and a distributor that is identical as to terms and conditions between the brewer and all its distributors, which has been approved by the commissioner. The franchise agreement binds the parties so that a distributor, appointed by a brewer, may distribute all the brewer's nonintoxicating beer products, brands, or family of brands imported and offered for sale in West Virginia, including, but not limited to, existing brands, line extensions, and new brands all in the brewer's assigned territory for the distributor. All brands and line extensions being imported or offered for sale in West Virginia must be listed by the brewer in the franchise agreement or a written amendment to the franchise agreement. A franchise agreement may be amended by mutual written agreement of the parties as approved by the commissioner with identical terms and conditions for a brewer and all its distributors. Any approved amendment to the franchise agreement becomes a part of the franchise agreement. A brewer and a distributor may mutually agree in writing to cancel a franchise agreement. A distributor terminated by a brewer as provided in this article and the promulgated rules no longer has a valid franchise agreement. If a brewer has reached an agreement to cancel a distributor or has terminated a distributor, then a brewer may appoint a successor distributor who accedes to all the rights of the cancelled or terminated distributor.(9) \"Franchise distributor network\" means the distributors who have entered into a binding written franchise agreement, identical as to terms and conditions, to distribute nonintoxicating beer products, brands, and line extensions in an assigned territory for a brewer. A brewer may only have one franchise distributor network:Provided, That a brewer that has acquired the manufacturing, bottling, or other production rights for the sale of nonintoxicating beer at wholesale from a selling brewer, as specified in §11-16-21(a)(2) of this code, shall continue to maintain and be bound by the selling brewer's separate franchise distributor's network for any of its existing brands, line extensions, and new brands.(10) \"Freestanding liquor retail outlet\" means a retail outlet that sells only liquor, wine, beer, nonintoxicating beer, and other alcohol-related products, as defined pursuant to §60-3A-4 of this code.(11) \"Growler\" means a container or jug that is made of glass, ceramic, metal, or other material approved by the commissioner, that may be no larger than 128 fluid ounces in size and must be capable of being securely sealed. The growler is used by an authorized licensee for purposes of off-premise sales only of nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer for personal consumption not on a licensed premise and not for resale. The nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer served and sold in a sealed growler may include ice or water mixed with the nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer to create a frozen nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer beverage. Any frozen nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer beverage machine used for filling growlers shall be sanitized daily, shall be under the control of the licensee in the secure area, and served to the patron by the licensee from the secure area. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, a securely sealed growler is not an open container under federal, state, and local law. A growler with a broken seal is an open container under federal, state, and local law unless it is located in an area of the motor vehicle physically separated from the passenger compartment. The secure sealing of a growler requires the use of a tamper-evident seal, security tape, or other material, as approved by the commissioner, placed on or over the growler's opening, which seal, security tape or other material is clearly marked with the date of the secure sealing by the authorized licensee who is selling the growler.(12) \"Line extension\" means any nonintoxicating beer product that is an extension of a brand or family of brands that is labeled, branded, advertised, marketed, promoted, or offered for sale with the intent or purpose of being manufactured, imported, associated, contracted, affiliated, or otherwise related to a brewer's existing brand through the use of a brewer, its subsidiaries, parent entities, contracted entities, affiliated entities, or other related entities. In determining whether a nonintoxicating beer product is a line extension, the commissioner may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: Name or partial name; trade name or partial trade name; logos; copyrights; trademarks or trade design; product codes; advertising promotion; or pricing.(13) \"Manager\" means an individual who is the applicant's or licensee's on-premises employee, member, partner, shareholder, director, or officer who meets the licensure requirements of §11-16-1et seq. of this code and rules promulgated thereunder who actively manages, conducts, and carries on the day-to-day operations of the applicant or licensee with full and apparent authority or actual authority to act on behalf of the applicant or licensee. Duties include but are not limited to: Coordinating staffing; reviewing and approving payroll; ordering and paying for inventory, such as nonintoxicating beer, wine, and liquor, as applicable; and managing security staff, security systems, video, and other security equipment; and any further acts or actions involved in managing the affairs of the business, on behalf of owners, partners, members, shareholders, officers, or directors.(14) \"Nonintoxicating beer\" means all natural cereal malt beverages or products of the brewing industry commonly referred to as beer, lager beer, ale, and all other mixtures and preparations produced by the brewing industry, including malt coolers and nonintoxicating craft beers with no caffeine infusion or any additives masking or altering the alcohol effect containing at least one half of one percent alcohol by volume, but not more than 11.9 percent of alcohol by weight, or 15 percent alcohol by volume, whichever is greater. The word \"liquor\", as used in §60-1-1et seq. of this code, does not include or embrace nonintoxicating beer nor any of the beverages, products, mixtures, or preparations included within this definition.(15) \"Nonintoxicating beer floor plan extension\" means a temporary one-day extension of an existing Class A licensee's floor plan to a contiguous, adjoining, and bounded area, such as a parking lot or outdoor area, which shall for the temporary period encompass the licensee's licensed premises; further the license shall be endorsed or approved by the county or municipality where the license is located; the license shall be in good standing with the commissioner, and further the temporary event shall cease on or before midnight of the approved temporary one-day event.(16) \"Nonintoxicating beer sampling event\" means an event approved by the commissioner for a Class A retail licensee to hold a nonintoxicating beer sampling authorized pursuant to §11-16-11a of this code.(17) \"Nonintoxicating beer sampling day\" means any days and hours of the week where Class A retail licensees may sell nonintoxicating beer, pursuant to §11-16-11a and §11-16-18(a)(1) of this code, and who are approved, in writing, by the commissioner to conduct a nonintoxicating beer sampling event.(18) \"Nonintoxicating craft beer\" means any beverage obtained by the natural fermentation of barley, malt, hops, or any other similar product or substitute and containing not less than one half of one percent by volume and not more than 15 percent alcohol by volume or 11.9 percent alcohol by weight with no caffeine infusion or any additives masking or altering the alcohol effect.(19) \"Original container\" means the container used by a resident brewer or brewer at the place of manufacturing, bottling, or otherwise producing nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer for sale at wholesale.(20) \"Person\" means and includes an individual, firm, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, association, or corporation.(21) \"Private club\" means a license issued pursuant to §60-7-1et seq. of this code.(22) \"Resident brewer\" means any brewer or manufacturer of nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer whose principal place of business and manufacture is located in the State of West Virginia; which may also have multiple manufacturing locations located in West Virginia as set forth in §11-16-9 of the code; and which does not brew or manufacture more than 25,000 barrels of nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer annually at all manufacturing locations in the aggregate and does not self-distribute more than 10,000 barrels thereof in the State of West Virginia annually from all manufacturing locations in the aggregate.(23) \"Retailer\" means any person selling, serving, or otherwise dispensing nonintoxicating beer and all products regulated by this article, including, but not limited to, malt coolers at his or her established and licensed place of business.(24) \"Tax Commissioner\" means the Tax Commissioner of the State of West Virginia or the commissioner's designee.",

Such application shall be verified and shall state:(1) The name of the corporation and the state under the laws of which it is incorporated;(2) The date of incorporation;(3) The address of the principal office of the corporation;(4) The names and respective addresses of the directors and officers of the corporation;(5) The date that such foreign corporation qualified to transact business in this state; and(6) Such other information as the commissioner, by rule or regulation, may require.(b) So long as the foreign corporation remains qualified to transact business in this state so that the Secretary of State can accept service of notice and process for such foreign corporation, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, none of the officers and directors of such foreign corporation need be residents of this state.(c) The license fee for a brewer’s license for a foreign corporation selling any nonintoxicating beer product within this state, whether or not its principal place of business be located in this state, shall be $1,500 per annum. The license period shall begin on July 1 of each year and end on June 30 of the following year, and if granted for a lesser period, the same shall be prorated semiannually in proportion to the remainder of the fiscal year.(d) As of July 1, 2019, there is an annual nonrefundable and non-prorated operational fee for all brewers, resident brewers, Class A retail dealers, Class B retail dealers, and distributors of $100 which shall be paid on or before July 1, 2019 and every July 1 thereafter. All fees collected by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in a special revenue account in the State Treasury, hereby created, to be known as the Beer License Operations Fund. Moneys in the fund may only be expended by the commissioner for the administration of this article, and as appropriated by law.(e) All representatives engaged in the selling, marketing, merchandising, or the conducting of any other sales on behalf of any brewer, resident brewer or distributor of nonintoxicating beer shall be issued a license by the commissioner. A licensee is subject to the provisions of §11-16-23 of this code for violations of this article and the rules promulgated thereunder. It is a violation of the code and rules to operate without such license and is punishable by the penalties available under this article. The commissioner shall prescribe forms to complete such licensure.(f) Any brewer, resident brewer, distributor or any person transporting nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer for resale, and not for personal use, in or through this state on behalf of such licensees or persons, or by contract or other means, who is operating in this state may only transport nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer available for resale, and not personal use, in or through this state. All vehicles transporting nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer shall be issued a nonintoxicating beer transportation permit. Transporting nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer for resale, and not for personal use, in or through this state without a nonintoxicating beer transportation permit is in violation of law and the penalties prescribed under §11-16-18 and §11-16-23 of this code are applicable for any violation. The commissioner shall prescribe forms to complete such permitting.(g) Any brewer or resident brewer offering nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer for sale under this article shall register, prior to offering such beer for sale in the state, with the commissioner each nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer container label. No nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer brand may be sold under this article unless all of such nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer brand’s container labels for the product intended for sale in the state have been registered and reviewed by the commissioner. Prior to registration of any nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer container labels, this review shall include, but not be limited to, a review of the alcohol content, corporate or product information, marketing and advertising so that the nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer container label is not intended to be marketed to persons less than 21 years of age. The commissioner shall remove all nonrenewed nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer container labels, and any licensee who sells nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer with nonrenewed container labels shall be subject to the penalties under §11-16-23 of this code. Failure to register, obtain a review, and a certification for a nonintoxicating beer or nonintoxicating craft beer container label and failure to register such labels will subject the brewer or resident brewer to penalties under said section. The commissioner shall prescribe forms to complete such registration.(h) The licenses and permits issued under the provisions of this section shall be renewed annually upon application for renewal on a form prescribed by the commissioner and payment of the annual license fee.(i) If at any time a foreign corporation is no longer qualified to transact business in this state, the Secretary of State shall notify the commissioner of such fact and the commissioner shall thereupon suspend the brewer’s license issued to such foreign corporation until such time as such foreign corporation has again qualified to transact business in this state and has otherwise complied with the provisions of this section.(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, any corporation issued a brewer’s license under the provisions of this article shall not engage in the business of a distributor or retailer as defined in this article.",

      "text": "Apportionment of tax base.(a) A taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by this article and also taxable in another state shall, for the purposes of this tax, apportion its tax base to this state by multiplying its tax base by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor, plus the payroll factor, plus two times the sales factor, all of which shall be determined as hereinafter provided in this section, and the denominator of which is four, reduced by the number of factors, if any, having no denominator, with the sales factor counting as two factors.(b) Property factor. -- The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used by it in this state during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the average value of all real and tangible personal property owned or rented by the taxpayer and used by it during the taxable year, which is reported on Schedule L of Federal Form 1120 (or 1065 for partnerships), plus the average value of all real and tangible personal property leased and used by the taxpayer during the taxable year.(c) Value of property. -- Property owned by the taxpayer shall be valued at its original cost, adjusted by subsequent capital additions or improvements thereto and partial disposition thereof, by reason of sale, exchange, abandonment, etc.: Provided, That where records of original cost are unavailable or cannot be obtained without unreasonable expense, property shall be valued at original cost as determined under regulations of the Tax Commissioner. Property rented by the taxpayer from others shall be valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental paid, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer, or for its benefit, in money or other consideration for the use of the property and includes:(1) Any amount payable for the use of real or tangible personal property, or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales, profits or otherwise.(2) Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of rents, such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other items which are required to be paid by the terms of the lease or other arrangement, not including amounts paid as service charges, such as utilities, janitor services, etc. If a payment includes rent and other charges unsegregated, the amount of rent shall be determined by consideration of the relative values of the rent and the other items.(d) Movable property. -- The value of movable tangible personal property used both within and without this state shall be included in the numerator to the extent of its utilization in this state. The extent of such utilization shall be determined by multiplying the original cost of such property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in this state during the taxable period, and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during the taxable year. The number of days of physical location of the property may be determined on a statistical basis or by such other reasonable method acceptable to the Tax Commissioner.(e) Leasehold improvements. -- Leasehold improvements shall, for the purposes of the property factor, be treated as property owned by the lessee regardless of whether the lessee is entitled to remove the improvements or the improvements revert to the lessor upon expiration of the lease. Leasehold improvements shall be included in the property factor at their original cost.(f) Average value of property. -- The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the taxable year: Provided, That the Tax Commissioner may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year if substantial fluctuations in the values of the property exist during the taxable year, or where property is acquired after the beginning of the taxable year, or is disposed of, or whose rental contract ceases, before the end of the taxable year.(g) Payroll factor. -- The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total compensation paid in this state during the taxable year by the taxpayer, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year as shown on the taxpayer's federal income tax return as filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as reflected in the schedule of wages and salaries and that portion of cost of goods sold which reflects compensation, or as shown on a pro forma return.(h) Compensation. -- The term \"compensation\" means wages, salaries, commissions and any other form of remuneration paid to employees for personal services. Payments made to an independent contractor or to any other person not properly classifiable as an employee shall be excluded. Only the amounts paid directly to employees shall be included in the payroll factor. Amounts considered paid directly to employees include the value of board, rent, housing, lodging and other benefits or services furnished to employees by the taxpayer in return for personal services, provided such amounts constitute income to the recipient for federal income tax purposes.(i) Employee. -- The term \"employee\" means:(1) Any officer of a corporation; or(2) Any individual who, under the usual common-law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee.(j) Compensation paid in this state. -- Compensation is paid in this state if:(1) The employee's service is performed entirely within the state;(2) The employee's service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual's service within the state. The word \"incidental\" means any service which is temporary or transitory in nature, or which is rendered in connection with an isolated transaction; or(3) Some of the service is performed in the state and:(A) The employee's base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state; or(B) The base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the employee's residence is in this state.The term \"base of operations\" is the place of more or less permanent nature from which the employee starts his work and to which he customarily returns in order to receive instructions from the taxpayer or communications from his customers or other persons or to replenish stock or other materials, repair equipment, or perform any other functions necessary to the exercise of his trade or profession at some other point or points. The term \"place from which the service is directed or controlled\" refers to the place from which the power to direct or control is exercised by the taxpayer.(k) Sales factor. -- The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross receipts of the taxpayer derived from transactions and activity in the regular course of its trade or business in this state during the taxable year (business income), less returns and allowances. The denominator of the fraction shall be the total gross receipts derived by the taxpayer from transactions and activity in the regular course of its trade or business during the taxable year (business income), and reflected in its gross income reported and as appearing on the taxpayer's Federal Form 1120 or 1065, and consisting of those certain pertinent portions of the (gross income) elements set forth: Provided, That if either the numerator or the denominator includes interest or dividends from obligations of the United States government which are exempt from taxation by this state, the amount of such interest and dividends, if any, shall be subtracted from the numerator or denominator in which it is included.(l) Allocation of sales of tangible personal property. --(1) Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:(i) The property is received in this state by the purchaser, other than the United States government, regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale. In the case of delivery by common carrier or other means of transportation, the place at which such property is ultimately received after all transportation has been completed shall be considered as the place at which such property is received by the purchaser. Direct delivery in this state, other than for purposes of transportation, to a person or firm designated by the purchaser, constitutes delivery to the purchaser in this state, and direct delivery outside this state to a person or firm designated by the purchaser does not constitute delivery to the purchaser in this state, regardless of where title passes or other conditions of sale; or(ii) The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this state and the purchaser is the United States government.(2) All other sales of tangible personal property delivered or shipped to a purchaser within a state in which the taxpayer is not taxed as defined in subsection (b), section seven, article twenty-four of this chapter shall be excluded from the denominator of the sales factor.(m) Allocation of other sales. -- Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if:(1) The income-producing activity is performed in this state;(2) The income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance; or(3) The sale constitutes business income to the taxpayer, or the taxpayer is a financial organization not having its commercial domicile in this state, and in either case the sale is a receipt described as attributable to this state in section five-a of this article.(n) Income-producing activity. -- The term \"income-producing activity\" applies to each separate item of income and means the transactions and activity directly engaged in by the taxpayer in the regular course of its trade or business for the ultimate purpose of obtaining gain or profit. Such activity does not include transactions and activities performed on behalf of the taxpayer, such as those conducted on its behalf by an independent contractor. \"Income-producing activity\" includes, but is not limited to, the following:(1) The rendering of personal services by employees with utilization of tangible and intangible property by the taxpayer in performing a service;(2) The sale, rental, leasing, licensing or other use of real property;(3) The sale, rental, leasing, licensing or other use of tangible personal property; or(4) The sale, licensing or other use of intangible personal property. The mere holding of intangible personal property is not, in itself, an income-producing activity: Provided, That the conduct of the business of a financial organization shall constitute an income-producing activity.(o) Cost of performance. -- The term \"cost of performance\" means direct costs determined in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with accepted conditions or practices in the trade or business of the taxpayer.(p) Other methods of allocation. --(1) General. -- If the allocation and apportionment provisions of subsection (a) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activities in this state, the taxpayer may petition for, or the Tax Commissioner may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activities, if reasonable:(A) Separate accounting;(B) The exclusion of one of the factors;(C) The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or(D) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation or apportionment of the taxpayer's tax base. Such petition shall be filed no later than the due date of the annual return for the taxable year for which the alternative method is requested, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return, and the petition shall include a statement of the petitioner's objections and of such alternative method of allocation or apportionment as it believes to be proper under the circumstances with such detail and proof as the Tax Commissioner may require.(2) Burden of proof. -- In any proceeding before the Tax Commissioner or in any court in which employment of one of the methods of allocation or apportionment provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection is sought, on the ground that the allocation and apportionment provisions of subsection (a) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activities in this state, the burden of proof shall:(A) If the Tax Commissioner seeks employment of one of such methods, be on the Tax Commissioner; or(B) If the taxpayer seeks employment of one of such other methods, be on the taxpayer.(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, financial organizations shall use only the special apportionment rules set forth in section five-a of this article.(q) Effective date. -- The amendments to this section made by this article shall apply to all taxable years ending after the effective date of this article. The provisions of paragraph (3), subsection (p) of this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1991.",
