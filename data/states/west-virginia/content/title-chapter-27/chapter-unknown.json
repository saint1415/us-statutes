      "text": "Governor to execute compact.The Governor of this state is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of West Virginia with any state or states of the United States legally joining therein in form substantially as follows:INTERSTATE COMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTHThe contracting states solemnly agree that:ARTICLE IThe party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.ARTICLE IIAs used in this compact:(a) \"Sending state\" shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.(b) \"Receiving state\" shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.(c) \"Institution\" shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency.(d) \"Patient\" shall mean any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state, for institutionalization or other care, treatment, or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact.(e) \"Aftercare\" shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release.(f) \"Mental illness\" shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.(g) \"Mental deficiency\" shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authority to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein.(h) \"State\" shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.ARTICLE III(a) Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, he shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of his residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.(c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient; furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient; given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish; and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient.(d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient.(e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient.ARTICLE IV(a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.(b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.(c) In supervising, treating, or caring for a patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care, and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.ARTICLE VWhenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.ARTICLE VIThe duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.ARTICLE VII(a) No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving state shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving state.(b) The sending state shall pay all costs of an incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.(c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.(d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact.(e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.ARTICLE VIII(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish, or in any way impair the rights, duties, and responsibilities of any patient's guardian on his own behalf or in respect of any patient for whom he may serve, except that where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving state may make such supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the previous guardian shall upon being duly advised of the new appointment, and upon the satisfactory completion of such accounting and other acts as such court may by law require, relieve the previous guardian of power and responsibility to whatever extent shall be appropriate in the circumstances: Provided, however, That in the case of any patient having settlement in the sending state, the court of competent jurisdiction in the sending state shall have the sole discretion to relieve a guardian appointed by it or continue his power and responsibility, whichever it shall deem advisable. The court in the receiving state may, in its discretion, confirm or reappoint the person or persons previously serving as guardian in the sending state in lieu of making a supplemental or substitute appointment.(b) The term \"guardian\" as used in paragraph (a) of this article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator, or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or responsibility for the person or property of a patient.ARTICLE IX(a) No provision of this compact except article V shall apply to any person institutionalized while under sentence in a penal or correctional institution or while subject to trial on a criminal charge, or whose institutionalization is due to the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness or mental deficiency, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional institution.(b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency.ARTICLE X(a) Each party state shall appoint a \"compact administrator\" who, on behalf of his state, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his state and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence, and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his state either in the capacity of sending or receiving state. The compact administrator or his duly designated representative shall be the official with whom other party states shall deal in any matter relating to the compact or any patient processed thereunder.(b) The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.ARTICLE XIThe duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities, or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.ARTICLE XIIThis compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law, and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.ARTICLE XIII(a) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect one year after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the Governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not change the status of any patient who has been sent to said state or sent out of said state pursuant to the provisions of the compact.(b) Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by article VII (b) as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.ARTICLE XIVThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

Definitions.As used in this compact:(a) \"Mentally disordered offender\" means a person who has been determined, by adjudication or other method legally sufficient for the purpose in the party state where the determination is made, to be mentally ill and:(1) Is under sentence for the commission of crime; or(2) Who is confined or committed on account of the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional facility.(b) \"Patient\" means a mentally disordered offender who is cared for, treated, or transferred pursuant to this compact.(c) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which the mentally disordered offender was convicted; or the state in which he would be subject to trial on or conviction of an offense, except for his mental condition; or, within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state whose authorities have filed a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint.(d) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which a mentally disordered offender is sent for care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation, or within the meaning of Article V of this compact, the state in which a petition in connection with an untried indictment, information or complaint has been filed.Article III.

Any sending state so contracting may, to the extent that moneys are legally available therefor, pay to the receiving state, a reasonable sum as consideration for such enlargement of capacity, or provision of equipment or structures, and reservation of capacity. Such payment may be in a lump sum or in installments as provided in the contract.(c) A party state may contract with any one or more other party states for the training of professional or other personnel whose services, by reason of such training, would become available for or be improved in respect of ability to participate in the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders.

The fact of presence in a receiving state shall not deprive any patient of any legal rights which said patient would have had if in custody or receiving care, treatment or supervision as appropriate in the sending state.(f) Any hearing or hearings to which a patient present in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state shall be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

Disposition of Charges.(a) Whenever the authorities responsible for the care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender, whether convicted or adjudicated in the state or subject to care, aftercare, treatment or rehabilitation pursuant to a contract, are of the opinion that charges based on untried indictments, informations or complaints in another party state present obstacles to the proper care and treatment of a mentally disordered offender or to the planning or execution of a suitable program for him such authorities may petition the appropriate court in the state where the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending for prompt disposition thereof. If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this paragraph.(b) The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within thirty days of the filing thereof. Such hearing shall be only to determine whether the proper safeguarding and advancement of the public interest; the condition of the mentally disordered offender; and the prospects for more satisfactory care, treatment and rehabilitation of him warrant disposition of the untried indictment, information or complaint prior to termination of the defendant's status as a mentally disordered offender in the sending state. The prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction from which the untried indictment, information or complaint is pending, the petitioning authorities, and such other persons as the court may determine shall be entitled to be heard.(c) Upon any hearing pursuant to this article, the court may order such adjournments or continuances as may be necessary for the examination or observation of the mentally disordered offender or for the securing of necessary evidence. In granting or denying any such adjournment or continuance, the court shall give primary consideration to the purposes of this compact, and more particularly to the need for expeditious determination of the legal and mental status of a mentally disordered offender so that his care, treatment and discharge to the community only under conditions which will be consonant with the public safety may be implemented.(d) The presence of a mentally disordered offender within a state wherein a petition is pending or being heard pursuant to this article, or his presence within any other state through which he is being transported in connection with such petition or hearing, shall be only for the purposes of this compact, and no court, agency or person shall have or obtain jurisdiction over such mentally disordered offender for any other purpose by reason of his presence pursuant to this article. The mentally disordered offender shall, at all times, remain in the custody of the sending state. Any acts of officers, employees, or agencies of the receiving state in providing or facilitating detention, housing or transportation for the mentally disordered offender shall be only as agents for the sending state.(e) Promptly upon conclusion of the hearing the court shall dismiss the untried indictment, information or complaint, if it finds that the purposes enumerated in paragraph (b) of this article would be served thereby. Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state.(f) No fact or other matter established or adjudicated at any hearing pursuant to this article, or in connection therewith, shall be deemed established or adjudicated, nor shall the same be admissible in evidence, in any subsequent prosecution of the untried indictment, information or complaint concerned in a petition filed pursuant to this article unless:(1) The defendant or his duly empowered legal representative requested or expressly acquiesced in the making of the petition, and was afforded an opportunity to participate in person in the hearing; or(2) The defendant himself offers or consents to the introduction of the determination or adjudication at such subsequent proceedings.Article VI. Acts Not Reviewable in ReceivingState; Return.(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove a patient from the receiving state there is pending against the patient within such state any criminal charge or if the patient is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the patient shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport patients pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.(b) A patient who escapes while receiving care and treatment or who violates provisions of aftercare by leaving the jurisdiction, or while being detained or transported pursuant to this compact shall be deemed an escapee from the sending state and from the state in which the facility is situated or the aftercare was being provided. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.Article VII. Federal Aid.Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any facility or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto and any patient in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision: Provided, That if such program or activity is not part of the customary regimen of the facility or program the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.Article VIII. Entry into Force.This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states from among the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states, or any other state upon similar action by such state.Article IX. Withdrawal and Termination.This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two years after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such patients as it may have in other party states pursuant to the provisions of this compact.Article X. Other Arrangements Unaffected.Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the custody, care, treatment, rehabilitation or aftercare of patients nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative arrangements.Article XI. Construction and Severability.The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

      "text": "Development of a strategic plan for a sequential intercept model to divert adults and juveniles with mental illness, developmental disabilities, cognitive disabilities, and substance use disorders away from the criminal justice system into treatment and to promote continuity of care and interventions; directing submission of a report to the Legislature.(a) The Legislature finds that the state’s adult and juvenile forensic patient populations continue to increase and that the placement of forensic patients at state health care facilities, diversion facilities, group homes, transitional living facilities, in the community, and other settings continues to rapidly escalate. The Legislature further finds that persons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, cognitive disabilities including, but not limited to, brain injuries, and/or substance use disorder may be overrepresented in the criminal justice system, and many of these people might not present a danger to the public if they could participate in a functioning community behavioral health continuum of care. The Legislature further finds that the increasing adult and juvenile forensic patient populations, the placement and treatment of adult and juvenile forensic patients, and the release of persons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, and other disabilities creates significant clinical, public safety, staffing, and fiscal needs and burdens for the judiciary, law enforcement, state health care facilities, correctional facilities, behavioral health professionals, hospitals, and the public. The Legislature further finds that there is a need for improved coordination among the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health Facilities, the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and the Division of Rehabilitation Services to promote the identification, safe discharge, and effective community intervention and placement of persons who suffer from mental illness, a developmental disability, a cognitive disability including, but not limited to, a brain injury, and/or substance use disorder. The Legislature further finds that there is a need to develop functional standards and protocols for the identification, management, qualified assessment, and treatment of adult and juvenile forensic patients.(b) The Chairman of the Dangerousness Assessment Advisory Board shall convene a multi-disciplinary study group of the following persons:(1) The Statewide Forensic Clinical Director;(2) The Statewide Forensic Coordinator;(3) The two forensic psychiatrists who are members of the Dangerousness Assessment Advisory Board;(4) The two psychologists who are members of the Dangerousness Assessment Advisory Board;(5) The Director of the Office of Drug Control Policy within the Department of Human Services;(6) A designee of the Supreme Court of Appeals;(7) A designee of the Bureau for Social Services within the Department of Human Services with experience in juvenile forensic matters;(8) A designee of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation within the Department of Homeland Security;(9) A designee of the Division of Rehabilitation Services within the Department of Commerce;(10) A designee of the Prosecuting Attorneys Institute;(11) A designee of the Public Defender Services;(12) A designee of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association who is a licensed clinician with forensic patient experience;(13) A designee of the West Virginia Hospital Association;(14) A designee of the West Virginia Housing Development Fund;(15) A designee of Disability Rights of West Virginia;(16) A designee of the West Virginia Sheriff’s Association;(17) A designee of the Juvenile Justice Commission;(18) A designee of the West Virginia University Center for Excellence in Disabilities;(19) A designee of the Department of Veterans Assistance;(20) A designee of the Department of Health Facilities;(21) A senator appointed by the President of the Senate; and(22) A delegate appointed by the Speaker of the House.(c) The purpose of the multi-disciplinary study group is to provide opinion, guidance, and informed objective expertise to the Legislature regarding each of the following areas:(1) The development and implementation of a sequential intercept model to divert adults and juveniles with mental illness, developmental disabilities, cognitive disabilities including, but not limited to, brain injuries, and/or substance use disorders away from the criminal justice system and into community-based treatment or other settings where appropriate;(2) The review and recommendation of standards and protocols for the evaluation, treatment, management, and stabilization of adult and juvenile forensic patients;(3) A recommendation regarding standards and protocols to promote continuity of care and interventions for adult and juvenile forensic patients and inmates released from correctional facilities;(4) The recommendation of a model to coordinate services and interventions among the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health Facilities, the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Division of Rehabilitation Services, behavioral healthcare providers, law enforcement, and the court system to facilitate the appropriate diversion, identification, evaluation, assessment, management, and placement of adults and juveniles who suffer from mental illness, a development disability, a cognitive disability including, but not limited to, a brain injury, and/or substance use disorder to ensure public safety and the effective clinical management of such persons;(5) The identification of potential funding sources and the scope of resources needed for the implementation of the study group’s recommendations; and(6) Any other issues related to addressing the Legislature's findings.(d) The provisions of §6-9A-1et seq. and §29B-1-1et seq. of this code are inapplicable to the operation of the study group.(e) The study group established in this section is hereby continued. The study group shall submit a supplemental report containing its findings and recommendations to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates on or before November 30, 2024. Thereafter, the study group shall submit an annual report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates updating its findings and recommendations on topics specified by the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary, the Joint Standing Committee on Finance, the Joint Standing Committee on Health, or the Legislative Oversight Committee on Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority.(f) Each member of the multi-disciplinary study group whose regular salary is not paid by the State of West Virginia shall be paid the same compensation and expense reimbursement that is paid to members of the Legislature for their interim duties as recommended by the Citizens Legislative Compensation Commission and authorized by law for each day or portion thereof engaged in the discharge of official duties. Reimbursement for expenses shall not be made, except upon an itemized account, properly certified by the members of the study group. All reimbursement for expenses shall be paid out of the State Treasury upon a requisition of the State Auditor.(g) The study group steering committee comprised of the Chairman of the Dangerousness Assessment Advisory Board, the Statewide Forensic Clinical Director, and the Statewide Forensic Coordinator may:(1) Enter into any contract for administrative support services as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section:Provided, That such services may only be paid for through grant funding;(2) Enter into a memorandum of understanding with and between any of the members of the study group as necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section; and(3) Seek grant funding to accomplish the purposes of this section.",
