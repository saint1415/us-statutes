Punishment prohibited before trial.No person, while being held for trial or awaiting a verdict, may be subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the charges pending against the person, nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed upon such person be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to insure the person's presence, but the person may be subjected to minor punishment during that period for infractions of discipline.§15-1E-14. Delivery of offenders to civil authorities.(a) A person subject to this article accused of an offense against civil authority may be delivered, upon request, to the civil authority for trial or confinement.(b) When delivery under this section is made to any civil authority of a person undergoing sentence of a court-martial, the delivery, if followed by conviction in a civil tribunal, interrupts the execution of the sentence of the court-martial, and the offender after having answered to the civil authorities for the offense shall, upon the request of competent military authority, be returned to the place of original custody for the completion of the person's sentence.PART III.

Commanding officer's nonjudicial punishment.(a) Under such regulations as prescribed, any commanding officer (and for purposes of this article, officers-in-charge) may impose disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial pursuant to this article.

Should the commanding officer determine that the punishment options may include arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused shall be notified of the right to demand trial by court-martial. Should the commanding officer determine that the punishment options will not include arrest in quarters or restriction, the accused shall be notified that there is no right to trial by courts-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment(g) The officer who imposes the punishment, or the successor in command, may, at any time, suspend, set aside, mitigate, or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The officer also may:(1) Mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay;(2) Mitigate arrest in quarters to restriction; or(3) Mitigate extra duties to restriction.The mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this section by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.(h) A person punished under this section who considers the punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority within fifteen days after the punishment is either announced or sent to the accused, as the commander may determine. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (g) by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment, the authority that is to act on the appeal may refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.(i) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission and not properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial and, when so shown, it shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.(j) Whenever a punishment of forfeiture of pay is imposed under this article, the forfeiture may apply to pay accruing before, on, or after the date that punishment is imposed.(k) Regulations may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this section and may prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.PART IV.

However, the person authorized under regulations prescribed under section twenty-seven of this article to detail counsel, in that person's sole discretion:(A) May detail additional military counsel as assistant defense counsel; and(B) If the accused is represented by military counsel of the accused's own selection under paragraph (B), subdivision (3), may approve a request from the accused that military counsel detailed under paragraph (A), subdivision (3), act as associate defense counsel.(7) The senior force judge advocate of the same force of which the accused is a member, shall determine whether the military counsel selected by an accused is reasonably available.(c) In any court-martial proceeding resulting in a conviction, the defense counsel:(1) May forward for attachment to the record of proceedings a brief of such matters as counsel determines should be considered in behalf of the accused on review, including any objection to the contents of the record which counsel considers appropriate;(2) May assist the accused in the submission of any matter under section sixty of this article; and(3) May take other action authorized by this article.§15-1E-39.

These proceedings may be conducted notwithstanding the number of court members and without regard to section twenty-nine.(c) When the members of a court-martial deliberate or vote, only the members may be present. All other proceedings, including any other consultation of the members of the court with counsel or the military judge, shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel, the trial counsel, and the military judge.§15-1E-40. Continuances.The military judge of a court-martial or a summary court-martial may, for reasonable cause, grant a continuance to any party for such time, and as often, as may appear to be just.§15-1E-41. Challenges.(a)(1) The military judge and members of a general or special court-martial may be challenged by the accused or the trial counsel for cause stated to the court. The military judge or the court shall determine the relevancy and validity of challenges for cause and may not receive a challenge to more than one person at a time. Challenges by the trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.(2) If exercise of a challenge for cause reduces the court below the minimum number of members required by section sixteen of this article, all parties shall, notwithstanding section twenty-nine of this article, either exercise or waive any challenge for cause then apparent against the remaining members of the court before additional members are detailed to the court.

The military judge may not be challenged except for cause.(2) If exercise of a peremptory challenge reduces the court below the minimum number of members required by section sixteen of this article, the parties shall, notwithstanding section twenty-nine of this article, either exercise or waive any remaining peremptory challenge, not previously waived, against the remaining members of the court before additional members are detailed to the court.(3) Whenever additional members are detailed to the court, and after any challenges for cause against such additional members are presented and decided, each accused and the trial counsel are entitled to one peremptory challenge against members not previously subject to peremptory challenge.§15-1E-42. Oaths or affirmations.(a) Before performing their respective duties, military judges, general and special courts-martial members, trial counsel, defense counsel, reporters, and interpreters shall take an oath or affirmation in the presence of the accused to perform their duties faithfully. The form of the oath or affirmation, the time and place of the taking thereof, the manner of recording the same, and whether the oath or affirmation shall be taken for all cases in which these duties are to be performed or for a particular case, shall be as prescribed in regulation or as provided by law. These regulations may provide that an oath or affirmation to perform faithfully the duties as a military judge, trial counsel, or defense counsel may be taken at any time by any judge advocate or other person certified or designated to be qualified or competent for the duty, and if such an oath or affirmation is taken, it need not again be taken at the time the judge advocate or other person is detailed to that duty.(b) Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined under oath or affirmation.§15-1E-43. Statute of limitations.(a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a person charged with any offense is not liable to be tried by court-martial or punished under section fifteen of this article if the offense was committed more than three years before the receipt of sworn charges and specifications by an officer exercising court-martial jurisdiction over the command or before the imposition of punishment under section fifteen of this article.(b) Periods in which the accused is absent without authority or fleeing from justice shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation prescribed in this article.(c) Periods in which the accused was absent from territory in which the state has the authority to apprehend him or her, or in the custody of civil authorities, or in the hands of the enemy, shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation prescribed in this article.(d) When the United States is at war, the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense under this article:(1) Involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United States, any state, or any agency of either in any manner, whether by conspiracy or not;(2) Committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control, or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States or any state; or(3) Committed in connection with the negotiation, procurement, award, performance, payment, interim financing, cancellation, or other termination or settlement, of any contract, subcontract, or purchase order which is connected with or related to the prosecution of the war, or with any disposition of termination inventory by any war contractor or government agency;is suspended until two years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed by the President or by a joint resolution of Congress.(e)(1) If charges or specifications are dismissed as defective or insufficient for any cause and the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations:(A) Has expired or will expire.(B) Will expire within one hundred eighty days after the date of dismissal of the charges and specifications,trial and punishment under new charges and specifications are not barred by the statute of limitations if the conditions specified in subdivision (2) are met.(2) The conditions referred to in subdivision (1) are that the new charges and specifications must:(A) Be received by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command within one hundred eighty days after the dismissal of the charges or specifications; and(B) Allege the same acts or omissions that were alleged in the dismissed charges or specifications or allege acts or omissions that were included in the dismissed charges or specifications.§15-1E-44. Former jeopardy.(a) No person may, without his or her consent, be tried a second time for the same offense.(b) No proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty by a court-martial upon any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this section until the finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has been fully completed.(c) A proceeding which, after the introduction of evidence but before a finding, is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion of the prosecution for failure of available evidence or witnesses without any fault of the accused is a trial in the sense of this article.§15-1E-45. Pleas of the accused.(a) If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading, or after a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that the accused has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect, or if the accused fails or refuses to plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court shall proceed as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.(b) With respect to any charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification may be entered immediately without vote. This finding shall constitute the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn prior to announcement of the sentence, in which event, the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.§15-1E-46. Opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence.The trial counsel, the defense counsel, and the court-martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence as prescribed by regulations and provided by law. Process issued in court-martial cases to compel witnesses to appear and testify and to compel the production of other evidence shall apply the principles of law and the rules of courts-martial generally recognized in military criminal cases in the courts of the Armed Forces of the United States, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this article. Process shall run to any part of the United States, or the Territories, Commonwealths, and possessions, and may be executed by civil officers as prescribed by the laws of the place where the witness or evidence is located or of the United States.§15-1E-47. Refusal to appear or testify.(a) Any person not subject to this article who:(1) Has been duly subpoenaed to appear as a witness or to produce books and records before a court-martial or court of inquiry, or before any military or civil officer designated to take a deposition to be read in evidence before such a court;(2) Has been duly paid or tendered the fees and mileage of a witness at the rates allowed to witnesses attending a criminal court of the state; and(3) Willfully neglects or refuses to appear, or refuses to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce any evidence which that person may have been legally subpoenaed to produce; may be punished by the military court in the same manner as a criminal court of the state.(b) The fees and mileage of witnesses shall be advanced or paid out of the appropriations for the compensation of witnesses.§15-1E-48. Contempts.A military judge or summary court-martial officer may punish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in its presence, or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder.(1) A person subject to this article may be punished for contempt by confinement not to exceed thirty days or a fine of $100, or both.(2) A person not subject to this article may be punished for contempt by a military court in the same manner as a criminal court of the state.§15-1E-49. Depositions.(a) At any time after charges have been signed as provided in section thirty of this article, any party may take oral or written depositions unless the military judge or summary court-martial officer hearing the case or, if the case is not being heard, an authority competent to convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good cause.(b) The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for taking the deposition.(c) Depositions may be taken before and authenticated by any military or civil officer authorized by the laws of the state or by the laws of the place where the deposition is taken to administer oaths.(d) A duly authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to the other parties, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, digital image or file, or similar material, may be played in evidence before any military court, if it appears:(1) That the witness resides or is beyond the state in which the court is ordered to sit, or beyond one hundred miles from the place of trial or hearing;(2) That the witness by reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, non amenability to process, or other reasonable cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of trial or hearing; or(3) That the present whereabouts of the witness is unknown.§15-1E-50. Admissibility of records of courts of inquiry.(a) In any case not extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer, the sworn testimony, contained in the duly authenticated record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, of a person whose oral testimony cannot be obtained, may, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, be read in evidence by any party before a court-martial if the accused was a party before the court of inquiry and if the same issue was involved or if the accused consents to the introduction of such evidence.(b) Such testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.(c) Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry.§15-1E-50a. Defense of lack of mental responsibility.(a) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.(b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.(c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and charge them to find the accused:(1) Guilty;(2) Not guilty; or(3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.(d) Subsection (c) does not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. In the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only or a summary court-martial officer, whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge or summary court-martial officer shall find the accused:(1) Guilty;(2) Not guilty; or(3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section fifty-two of this article, the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility if:(1) A majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established; or(2) In the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only or a summary court-martial officer, the military judge or summary court-martial officer determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.§15-1E-51. Voting and rulings.(a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.(b) The military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in section fifty-two of this article, beginning with the junior in rank.(c) Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them:(1) That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his or her guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;(2) That in the case being considered, if there is a or reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused must be acquitted;(3) That, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and(4) That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the state.(d) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request, find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.§15-1E-52. Number of votes required.(a) No person may be convicted of an offense except as provided in section forty-two of this article or by the concurrence of two thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.(b) All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.§15-1E-53. Court to announce action.A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties as soon as determined.§15-1E-54. Record of trial.(a) Each general and special court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge. If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his or her death, disability, or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member, if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of his or her death, disability, or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge, the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a member under this subsection.(b) (1) A complete verbatim record of the proceedings and testimony shall be prepared in each general and special court-martial case resulting in a conviction.(2) In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such matters as may be prescribed by regulations.(c) Each summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in the manner as may be prescribed by regulations.(d) A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.PART VIII. SENTENCES.§15-1E-55. Cruel and unusual punishments prohibited.Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment may not be adjudged by a court-martial or inflicted upon any person subject to this article. The use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.§15-1E-56. Maximum limits.(a) The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as prescribed by this article, but in no instance may a sentence exceed more than ten years for a military offense, nor shall a sentence of death be adjudged. A conviction by general court-martial of any military offense for which an accused may receive a sentence of confinement for more than one year is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a summary court-martial, all other military offenses are misdemeanors. Any conviction by a summary court-martial is not a criminal conviction.(b) The limits of punishment for violations of the punitive articles prescribed herein shall be lesser of the sentences prescribed by the manual for courts-martial of the United States in effect on January 1, 2004, and the state manual for courts-martial, but in no instance shall any punishment exceed that authorized by this article.§15-1E-57. Effective date of sentences.(a) Whenever a sentence of a court-martial as lawfully adjudged and approved includes a forfeiture of pay or allowances in addition to confinement not suspended, the forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances becoming due on or after the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before that date.(b) Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.(c) All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date ordered executed.§15-1E-57a. Deferment of sentences.(a) On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under that person's jurisdiction, the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned, may in that person's sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the person who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under that person's jurisdiction, by the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.(b)(1) In any case in which a court-martial sentences an accused referred to in subdivision (2) of this subsection, to confinement, the convening authority may defer the service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of the accused, until after the accused has been permanently released to the state military forces by a state, the United States, or a foreign country referred to in that subdivision.(2) Subdivision (1) of this subsection applies to a person subject to this article who:(A) While in the custody of a state, the United States, or a foreign country is temporarily returned by that state, the United States, or a foreign country to the state military forces for trial by court-martial; and(B) After the court-martial, is returned to that state, the United States, or a foreign country under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.(3) In this subsection, the term \"state\" includes the District of Columbia and any Commonwealth, Territory, or possession of the United States.(c) In any case in which a court-martial sentences an accused to confinement and the sentence to confinement has been ordered executed, but in which review of the case under subsection (a), section sixty-seven of this article is pending, the Adjutant General may defer further service of the sentence to confinement while that review is pending.§15-1E-58. Execution of confinement.(a) A sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place authorized by this article. Persons so confined are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons regularly confined or committed to that place of confinement.(b) The omission of \"hard labor\" as a sentence authorized under this article does not deprive the state confinement facility from employing it, if it otherwise is within the authority of that facility to do so.(c) No place of confinement may require payment of any fee or charge for so receiving or confining a person except as otherwise provided by law.§15-1E-58a. Sentences: Reduction in enlisted grade upon approval.(a) A court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-1, as approved by the convening authority, that includes:(1) A dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge; or(2) Confinement; reduces that member to pay grade E-1, effective on the date of that approval.(b) If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade under subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved, or, as finally approved, does not include any punishment named in subsection (a), the rights and privileges of which the person was deprived because of that reduction shall be restored, including pay and allowances.§15-1E-58b. Sentences: Forfeiture of pay and allowances during confinement.(a)(1) A court-martial sentence described in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall result in the forfeiture of pay, or of pay and allowances, due that member during any period of confinement or parole. The forfeiture pursuant to this section shall take effect on the date determined under subsection (a), section fifty-seven of this article and may be deferred as provided by that section. The pay and allowances forfeited, in the case of a general court-martial, shall be all pay and allowances due that member during such period and, in the case of a special court-martial, shall be two-thirds of all pay due that member during such period.(2) A sentence covered by this section is any sentence that includes:(A) Confinement for more than six months; or(B) Confinement for six months or less and a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or dismissal.(b) In a case involving an accused who has dependents, the convening authority or other person acting under section sixty of this article may waive any or all of the forfeitures of pay and allowances required by subsection (a) for a period not to exceed six months. Any amount of pay or allowances that, except for a waiver under this subsection, would be forfeited shall be paid, as the convening authority or other person taking action directs, to the dependents of the accused.(c) If the sentence of a member who forfeits pay and allowances under subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved or, as finally approved, does not provide for a punishment referred to in subdivision (2), subsection (a), the member shall be paid the pay and allowances which the member would have been paid, except for the forfeiture, for the period during which the forfeiture was in effect.PART IX. POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE AND REVIEW OF COURTS-MARTIAL.§15-1E-59. Error of law; lesser included offense.(a) A finding or sentence of a court-martial may not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.(b) Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, so much of the finding as includes a lesser included offense.§15-1E-60. Action by the convening authority.(a) The findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be reported promptly to the convening authority after the announcement of the sentence.(b)(1) The accused may submit to the convening authority matters for consideration by the convening authority with respect to the findings and the sentence. Any such submission shall be in writing. Except in a summary court-martial case, such a submission shall be made within ten days after the accused has been given an authenticated record of trial and, if applicable, the recommendation of a judge advocate under subsection (d). In a summary court-martial case, such a submission shall be made within seven days after the sentence is announced.(2) If the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such matters, the convening authority or other person taking action under this section, for good cause, may extend the applicable period under subdivision (1) for not more than an additional twenty days.(3) In a summary court-martial case, the accused shall be promptly provided a copy of the record of trial for use in preparing a submission authorized by subdivision (1).(4) The accused may waive the right to make a submission to the convening authority under subdivision (1). Such a waiver must be made in writing and may not be revoked. For the purposes of subdivision (2), subsection (c), the time within which the accused may make a submission under this subsection shall be deemed to have expired upon the submission of such a waiver to the convening authority.(c)(1) The authority under this section to modify the findings and sentence of a court-martial is a matter of command prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening authority. If it is impractical for the convening authority to act, the convening authority shall forward the case to a person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction who may take action under this section.(2) Action on the sentence of a court-martial shall be taken by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section. Such action may be taken only after consideration of any matters submitted by the accused under subsection (b) or after the time for submitting such matters expires, whichever is earlier. The convening authority or other person taking such action, in that person's sole discretion may approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend the sentence in whole or in part.(3) Action on the findings of a court-martial by the convening authority or other person acting on the sentence is not required. However, such person, in the person's sole discretion may:(A) Dismiss any charge or specification by setting aside a finding of guilty thereto; or(B) Change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.(d) Before acting under this section on any general or special court-martial case in which there is a finding of guilt, the convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall obtain and consider the written recommendation of a judge advocate. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall refer the record of trial to the judge advocate, and the judge advocate shall use such record in the preparation of the recommendation. The recommendation of the judge advocate shall include such matters as may be prescribed by regulation and shall be served on the accused, who may submit any matter in response under subsection (b). Failure to object in the response to the recommendation or to any matter attached to the recommendation waives the right to object thereto.(e)(1) The convening authority or other person taking action under this section, in the person's sole discretion, may order a proceeding in revision or a rehearing.(2) A proceeding in revision may be ordered if there is an apparent error or omission in the record or if the record shows improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect to the findings or sentence that can be rectified without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused. In no case, however, may a proceeding in revision:(A) Reconsider a finding of not guilty of any specification or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;(B) Reconsider a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless there has been a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some section of this article; or(C) Increase the severity of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory.(3) A rehearing may be ordered by the convening authority or other person taking action under this section if that person disapproves the findings and sentence and states the reasons for disapproval of the findings. If such person disapproves the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, that person shall dismiss the charges. A rehearing as to the findings may not be ordered where there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. A rehearing as to the sentence may be ordered if the convening authority or other person taking action under this subsection disapproves the sentence.§15-1E-61. Withdrawal of appeal.(a) In each case subject to appellate review under this article, the accused may file with the convening authority a statement expressly withdrawing the right of the accused to such appeal. Such a withdrawal shall be signed by both the accused and his or her defense counsel and must be filed in accordance with appellate procedures as provided by law.(b) The accused may withdraw an appeal at any time in accordance with appellate procedures as provided by law.§15-1E-62.

THE CHILD PROTECTION ACT OF 2006.§15-1I-1. The Child Protection Act of 2006.This article and those other amendments and additions to this code established by this Act, enacted during the first extraordinary session of the West Virginia Legislature, two thousand six shall be known as \"The Child Protection Act of 2006.\"§15-1I-2. Legislative findings.(a) The purpose of \"The Child Protection Act of 2006\" is to put in place a series of programs, criminal law revisions, and other reforms to provide and promote the ability of the children of this state to live their lives without being exposed and subjected to neglect and physical and sexual abuse. The targeted increases in terms of incarceration, enhanced treatment, post-release supervision, and new approaches toward the state’s child protection system will, in the aggregate, strengthen government’s ability to address this most serious problem. The Legislature finds that the broad reaching measures encompassed in this Act will provide for greater intervention among and punishment and monitoring of individuals who create a risk to our children’s safety and well-being.(b) The Legislature further finds that the following reforms implemented as part of this Act will provide protections to the children of this state and are all important to eliminate risks to children and are essential elements of \"The Child Protection Act of 2006\":(1) Creating a special unit in the State Police specializing in the investigation of child abuse and neglect — §15-2-15 of this code;(2) Modifying the Sex Offender Registration Act to ensure more effective registration, identification, and monitoring of persons convicted of sexual offenses — §15-12-1et seq. of this code;(3) Establishing the Child Abuse and Neglect Registry, requiring the registry to disclose information to certain state and local officials — §15-13-1et seq. of this code;(4) Providing for coded driver’s licenses and nondriver identification cards to more easily identify sexually violent predators — §17B-2-3 of this code;(5) Prohibiting contractors and service providers convicted of certain offenses from accessing school grounds and providing for the release of criminal history information by the central abuse registry to county school boards — §18-5-15c of this code;(6) Establishing a task force to study the feasibility of constructing separate correctional facilities for the incarceration and treatment of sex offenders — §25-1-22 of this code;(7) Requiring the State Police and the Department of Human Services to maintain statewide child abuse and neglect statistical indices of all convictions and allegations, respectively — §15-2-15 and §49-2-813 of this code;(8) Providing for increased terms of incarceration for first degree sexual assault and first degree sexual abuse committed against children under the age of 12 — §61-8B-3 and §61-8B-7 of this code;(9) Eliminating eligibility of certain sex offenders for probation, home incarceration, and alternative sentences and providing for enhanced terms of incarceration for certain subsequent sex offenses committed by recidivist sex offenders — §61-8B-9a and §61-8B-9b of this code;(10) Providing for polygraph examinations for certain sex offenders on probation, parole, or supervised release — §62-11D-1et seq. of this code;(11) Providing for electronic monitoring of certain sex offenders on probation, parole, and supervised release — §62-11D-1et seq. of this code;(12) Establishing a task force to develop measures aimed at managing sexually violent predators released from confinement — §62-11E-1et seq. of this code;(13) Making psychiatric evaluations a condition of probation eligibility for certain sex offenders (- §62-12-2 of this code;(14) Authorizing the Department of Human Services to establish qualifications for sex offender treatment programs and counselors — §62-12-2 and §62-12-26 of this code;(15) Providing for extended supervision of certain offenders and supervised release requirements for sexually violent offenders — §62-12-26 of this code; and(16) Providing for prerelease risk assessments of certain sex offenders — §62-12-27 of this code.(c) In addition, the Legislature finds that those enhanced terms of incarceration and post-conviction measures provided for in this Act which impact certain offenders convicted of sexual offenses against adults are necessary and appropriate to protect children from neglect and physical and sexual abuse given that: (1) Clinical research indicates that a substantial percentage of sexual offenders \"cross over\" among age groups in selecting their victims; (2) many of the risk factors prevalent among sex offenders that \"cross over\" (e.g., substance abuse, lack of empathy toward victim, inability to control inappropriate impulses, childhood abuse) also are prevalent among perpetrators of child abuse and neglect; and (3) enhanced terms of incarceration, post-conviction supervision, monitoring,` and treatment measures will enable the criminal justice system to identify and address those \"cross over\" offenders before they can victimize additional children.ARTICLE 1J. THE WEST VIRGINIA MILITARY AUTHORITY ACT.§15–1J-1. Short title.This article shall be known and may be cited as the West Virginia Military Authority Act.§15-1J-2. Legislative findings.The Legislature finds that the West Virginia National Guard is a unique entity that has a dual mission for both West Virginia and the United States. In this dual capacity, the West Virginia National Guard receives funds to administer programs, including the hiring of employees, that the federal government, including the Department of Defense, provides to the guard in support of specific activities for various federal agencies for national security and homeland security purposes. These programs fulfill specific agency purposes and necessarily require continued funding by the federal government.Additionally, the guard continues to receive federal funding to develop and maintain capabilities to house, refurbish, rebuild and maintain military equipment and conduct other test and operational activities to support national and homeland security objectives. These activities require the guard to enter into contracts and subcontracts for specialized technical services and hire persons who will be compensated, in whole or in part, with federal funds. It is further determined and declared that it is necessary for the guard to develop and implement a procedure for hiring and management of nonmilitary employees to support its specific missions.§15-1J-3.

State Police Voluntary Contribution Fund.(a) The Legislature finds that from the year 1951 to 2003, employees of the West Virginia State Police or its predecessor agencies have operated a voluntary contribution fund. Upon the death of a member or employee of the West Virginia State Police who, upon his or her death, was a member of the contribution fund, active members and employees of the West Virginia State Police who have voluntarily chosen to be members of the fund have been permitted, as an expression of respect and gratitude for the contributions and service of the deceased member in protecting the public, to donate small financial contributions to a designated beneficiary of the deceased member. The contributions were deposited into the contribution fund and the disbursements were made from the fund.The Legislature further finds, upon the reports of the Legislative Auditor, that over the years, without statutory authority to do so, administrators of the West Virginia State Police and its predecessor agencies assumed control of the administration of the contribution fund, performing or directing the administrative functions necessary to receive contributions to and disbursements from the contribution fund.The Legislature further finds that the State of West Virginia had not established the contribution fund or any similar benefit plan for the members and employees of the West Virginia State Police or its predecessor agencies, nor approved the same as an official state benefit program or plan in any manner whatsoever. In the absence of the establishment or approval of such a program or plan by the Legislature, the exercise of administrative powers for these purposes is inappropriate.The Legislature further finds that the contribution fund is not a state program, but a private activity to which individual employees of the West Virginia State Police have committed state time and resources.The Legislature further finds that the contributions and service of deceased members and employees of the West Virginia State Police merit sincere, dignified and personal voluntary expressions of respect and gratitude from fellow members and employees of the deceased. The Legislature further finds that the continuance of the contribution fund or similar benefit plan for the purposes of facilitating those personal voluntary expressions of respect and gratitude may be appropriate under certain circumstances.It is therefore the intent of the Legislature to authorize the limited use of staff and other resources incidental to the continued administration of the private contribution fund in accordance with the provisions of this section.(b) The limited use of State Police staff time, postage, duplicating and incidental resources is authorized in the continued administration of the contribution fund for the purpose of facilitating contributions and disbursements from the fund if the following conditions have been met:(1) The superintendent has provided each member and employee of the West Virginia State Police a copy of this section and a statement in writing that clearly advises the member or employee that the contribution fund is a private activity established and maintained by members and employees of the West Virginia State Police in their private capacity with limited administration by the West Virginia State Police and is not in any manner a benefit or other plan provided by or on behalf of the State of West Virginia and that participation in the fund or plan is not required, but is only permitted if the member or employee elects to participate on a voluntary basis with no obligation to give nor opportunity for coerced participation and that the purpose of the fund is to facilitate participating members' expressions of admiration, appreciation and bereavement to the survivors of deceased members;(2) All rosters, records and accounts of the contribution fund are available for public inspection and audit; and(3) State Police administration is consistent with all applicable federal and state tax requirements.(c) Membership in the State Police Contribution Fund is voluntary. On or before July 31, 2006, members or employees hired between January 1, 2003, and the effective date of this section may elect to participate in the fund, and within five days of employment or reemployment with the West Virginia State Police, a member or employee may elect to participate in the fund: Provided, That any member of the original contribution fund in good standing upon the effective date of this section shall be presumed to be a member of the contribution fund. A retired member may maintain membership in the fund. A member may terminate membership in the fund at any time, by written notice to the superintendent, or by ceasing to make contributions to the fund. Upon the death of a member of the fund, the superintendent is authorized to collect a contribution not to exceed the sum of $5 from all personnel participating in the fund, payable to a designated beneficiary of the deceased member. To aid administrative efficiency and ease the burden of participation, the superintendent may collect funds prospectively to cover an estimated number of deaths in a given period: Provided, That any such remaining funds credited to a deceased member shall be returned to the member's designated beneficiary.(d) Use of coercion in an attempt to influence a West Virginia State Police officer's or employee's election to participate in the contribution fund is prohibited and grounds for dismissal from employment.(e) The superintendent is authorized to establish and maintain a nongovernmental bank account established by agreement with a bank within the state to receive contributions to and make disbursements from the fund. These receipts are not to be deposited or held in the state Treasury.(f) The superintendent shall verify any death of a member of the fund and authorize the dissemination of a notice of the death to members of the fund. The superintendent shall use the most cost efficient means of communication available in making these notifications.(g) The superintendent is authorized to develop a written internal department policy for the operation of the contribution fund, which may include terms and conditions of membership and the development of any necessary forms or agreements for enrollment in the fund and the designation of a beneficiary.§15-2-10.

He or she shall also provide the standard uniforms for all members of the State Police, for officers, noncommissioned officers and troopers provided for in this section. All uniforms and all arms, weapons and other property furnished the members of the State Police by the State of West Virginia are and remain the property of the state.(d) The superintendent may purchase and maintain on behalf of members group life insurance not to exceed the amount of $5,000 on behalf of each member.(e) The superintendent may contract and furnish at State Police expense medical and hospital services for treatment of illness or injury of a member which shall be determined by the superintendent to have been incurred by the member while engaged in the performance of duty and from causes beyond control of the members. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the superintendent has the right of subrogation in any civil action or settlement brought by or on behalf of a member in relation to any act by another which results in the illness, injury or death of a member. To this end, the superintendent may initiate an action on behalf of the State Police in order to recover the costs incurred in providing medical and hospital services for the treatment of a member resulting from injury or illness originating in the performance of official duties. This subsection shall not affect the power of a court to apply ordinary equitable defenses to the right of subrogation.The superintendent may also consult with the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner in an effort to defray the cost of medical and hospital services. In no case will the compensation rendered to health care providers for medical and hospital services exceed the then current rate schedule in use by the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner.Third-party reimbursements received by the superintendent after the expiration of the fiscal year in which the injury, illness or death occurred will be deposited to a nonexpiring special revenue account.

Awarding service revolver upon retirement and disposal of service weapon when replaced due to routine wear.(a) Upon the retirement of a member of the West Virginia state police, the superintendent shall award to the retiring member his or her service revolver, without charge, upon determining:(1) That the retiring member is retiring honorably with at least twenty years of service; or(2) Such retiring member is retiring with less than twenty years of service based upon a determination that such member is totally physically disabled as a result of his or her service with the West Virginia state police.(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the superintendent may not award his or her service revolver to any member whom the superintendent finds to be mentally incapacitated or who constitutes a danger to any person or the community.(c) The disposal of state police service weapons, when replaced due to routine wear, shall not fall under the jurisdiction of the agency for surplus property, within the Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration. The superintendent may offer these surplus weapons for sale to any active or retired member of the State Police, at fair market value, with the proceeds from any sales used to offset the cost of the new weapons.§15-2-44. Federal law maximum benefit limitations.Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or state law, the board shall administer the fund in compliance with the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations under that section to the extent applicable to governmental plans (hereafter sometimes referred to as the \"415 limitation(s)\" or \"415 dollar limitation(s)\"), so that the annual benefit payable under this system to a member shall not exceed those limitations. Any annual benefit payable under this system shall be reduced or limited if necessary to an amount which does not exceed those limitations. The extent to which any annuity or other annual benefit payable under this fund shall be reduced, as compared with the extent to which an annuity, contributions or other benefits under any other defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans required to be taken into consideration under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be reduced, shall be proportional on a percentage basis to the reductions made in such other plans administered by the board and required to be so taken into consideration under Section 415, unless a disproportionate reduction is determined by the board to maximize the aggregate benefits payable to the member. If the reduction is under this fund, the board shall advise affected members or retirants of any additional limitation on the annuities or other annual benefit required by this section. For purposes of the 415 limitations, the \"limitation year\" shall be the calendar year. The 415 limitations are incorporated herein by reference, except to the extent the following provisions may modify the default provisions thereunder:(a) The annual adjustment to the 415 dollar limitations made by Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder shall apply for each limitation year. The annual adjustments to the dollar limitations under Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code which become effective: (i) After a retirant's severance from employment with the employer; or (ii) after the annuity starting date in the case of a retirant who has already commenced receiving benefits, will apply with respect to a retirant's annual benefit in any limitation year. A retirant's annual benefit payable in any limitation year from this retirement fund shall in no event be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.(b) For purposes of this section, the \"annual benefit\" means a benefit that is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time as such other form of benefit, using factors prescribed in the 415 limitation regulations, before applying the 415 limitations. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for: (1) Survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the member's benefit were paid in another form; (2) benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (3) the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this article, and the plan provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this article applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.(c) Adjustment for benefit forms not subject to Section 417(e)(3). -- The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection if the form of the member's benefit is either: (1) A nondecreasing annuity (other than a straight life annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the member (or, in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse); or (2) an annuity that decreases during the life of the member merely because of: (i) The death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below fifty percent of the benefit payable before the death of the survivor annuitant); or (ii) the cessation or reduction of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code). The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of: (I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit; and (II) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62) for that annuity starting date.(d) Adjustment for benefit forms subject to Section 417(e)(3). -- The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection if the form of the member's benefit is other than a benefit form described in subdivision (c) of this section. In this case, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity shall be determined as follows: The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of: (1) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate specified in this retirement fund and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in this retirement fund for adjusting benefits in the same form; (2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five and a half percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62) for that annuity starting date; and (3) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), divided by 1.05.(e) Benefits payable prior to age sixty-two. --(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, if the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two, the 415 dollar limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, so that the limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when the retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to an annual benefit in the amount of the applicable dollar limitation of Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code) beginning at age sixty-two.(2) The limitation reduction provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not apply if the member commencing retirement benefits before age sixty-two is a qualified participant. A qualified participant for this purpose is a participant in a defined benefit plan maintained by a state, or any political subdivision of a state, with respect to whom the service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under the defined benefit plan includes at least fifteen years of service: (i) As a full-time employee of any police or fire department organized and operated by the state or political subdivision maintaining the defined benefit plan to provide police protection, firefighting services or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of such state or political subdivision; or (ii) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.(3) The limitation reduction provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.(4) For purposes of adjusting the 415 dollar limitation for benefit commencement before age sixty-two or after age sixty-five (if the plan provides for such adjustment), no adjustment is made to reflect the probability of a member's death: (i) After the annuity starting date and before age sixty-two; or (ii) after age sixty-five and before the annuity starting date.(f) Adjustment when member has less than ten years of participation. -- In the case of a member who has less than ten years of participation in the retirement fund (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii)), the 415 dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and subdivision (e) of this section) shall be reduced by multiplying the otherwise applicable limitation by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of participation in the plan (or one, if greater), and the denominator of which is ten. This adjustment shall not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.(g) The application of the provisions of this section shall not cause the maximum annual benefit provided to a member to be less than the member's accrued benefit as of December 31, 2008 (the end of the limitation year that is immediately prior to the effective date of the final regulations for this retirement system as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.415(a)-1(g)(2)), under provisions of the retirement system that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007, provided that such provisions satisfied the applicable requirements of statutory provisions, regulations, and other published guidance relating to Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect as of December 31, 2008, as described in Treasury Regulation §1.415(a)-1(g)(4). If additional benefits are accrued for a member under this retirement system after January 1, 2009, then the sum of the benefits described under the first sentence of this subsection and benefits accrued for a member after January 1, 2009, must satisfy the requirements of Section 415, taking into account all applicable requirements of the final 415 Treasury Regulations.§15-2-45. Federal law minimum required distributions.The requirements of this section apply to any distribution of a member’s or beneficiary’s interest and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this code. This section applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 1986. Notwithstanding anything in the retirement system to the contrary, the payment of benefits under this article shall be determined and made in accordance with §401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder as applicable to governmental plans, including without limitation the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of §401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder, and the incidental benefit rule of §1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of the regulations.

Benefit payments under this section shall not be delayed pending, or contingent upon, receipt of an application for retirement from the member.(b) If a member dies after distribution to him or her has commenced pursuant to this section but before his or her entire interest in the retirement system has been distributed, then the remaining portion of that interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of his or her death.(c) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced, then his or her entire interest in the fund is to be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death, unless the provisions of subsection (d) of this section apply.(d) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced, and the member’s interest is eligible to be paid in the form of a survivor annuity to a designated beneficiary, distributions are to be made over the life of that beneficiary or over a period certain not greater than the life expectancy of that beneficiary, commencing on or before the following:(1) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or(2) If the member’s sole designated beneficiary is either the surviving spouse or a former spouse who, as an alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, is receiving 100 percent of the survivor benefit, distributions are to commence on or before the later of:(A) December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained the applicable age as set forth in the definition of required beginning date provided in subsection (a) of this section; or(B) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.(e) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced and the survivor annuity provisions of subsection (d) of this section are not applicable, any designated beneficiary who is eligible to receive a distribution pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section may elect to have life expectancy treatment apply to the distribution for purposes of determining whether any portion of the distribution is an eligible rollover distribution:Provided, That any such election shall not delay the required distribution of the deceased member’s entire interest in the retirement system beyond December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death as required by subsection (c) of this section:Provided, however, That the election is timely made in a form acceptable to the board on or before the following:(1) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or(2) If the member’s sole designated beneficiary is either the surviving spouse or a former spouse who, as an alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, is receiving 100 percent of the survivor benefit, election of life expectancy treatment must be made on or before the earlier of:(A) The later of: (i) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or (ii) December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained the applicable age as set forth in the definition of required beginning date provided in subsection (a) of this section; or(B) October 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death.§15-2-46. Direct rollovers.(a) Except where otherwise stated, this section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this fund, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:(1) \"Eligible rollover distribution\" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any of the following: (i) Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or the joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities; (iv) any hardship distribution described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(iv) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (v) any other distribution or distributions that are reasonably expected to total less than $200 during a year. For distributions after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, this portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007) to a qualified trust which is part of a defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006) to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(a) or(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred (including interest or earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution which is not so includable, or (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007) to a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code.(2) \"Eligible retirement plan\" means an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution: Provided, That in the case of an eligible rollover distribution prior to January 1, 2002, to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is limited to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. For distributions after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into the plan from this system. For distributions after December 31, 2007, an eligible retirement plan also means a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code: Provided, That in the case of an eligible rollover distribution after December 31, 2007, to a designated beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) as such term is defined in Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible retirement plan is limited to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity which meets the conditions of Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code.(3) \"Distributee\" means a member. In addition, the member's surviving spouse and the member's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to governmental plans, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, the board shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent for the exclusive benefit of the members and their beneficiaries. Any provision of this article referencing or relating to these federal qualification requirements shall be effective as of the date required by federal law. The board may promulgate rules and amend or repeal conflicting rules in accordance with the authority granted to the board pursuant to section one, article ten-d of chapter five to assure compliance with this section.§15-2-48. Specification of actuarial assumptions.The board shall specify and adopt all actuarial assumptions for the fund at its first meeting of every calendar year or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, which assumptions shall become part of the terms of the fund.§15-2-49.

Any change in benefits resulting from this recalculation shall not be retroactive in nature. The provisions of subsection (c), section twenty-nine of this article shall not apply with respect to payments for medical, surgical, laboratory, X-ray, hospital, ambulance and dental expenses and fees.

The president may designate the vice president of the association or the chairman of the association's board of directors to act on his or her behalf. The West Virginia State Police will calculate the dollar value of the donated leave based on the hourly rate of the donor multiplied by the number of hours of annual leave to be donated and the donee will use the annual leave at the present dollar value of the donee's hourly rate. The donated annual leave may be used by the president or designee in the performance of his or her duties including: (1) Assistance to members; and (2) the legislative session and legislative meetings.(b) When the president of the association or his or her designee uses the donated annual leave he or she is considered on personal annual leave of absence with pay just as if he or she used his or her annual leave.

Correction of errors; underpayments; overpayments.(a)General rule. — Upon learning of any errors, the board shall correct errors in the system in a timely manner whether the individual, entity, or board was at fault for the error with the intent of placing the affected individual, entity and retirement board in the position each would have been in had the error not occurred.(b)Underpayments to the system. — Any error resulting in an underpayment to the system may be corrected by the member or retirant remitting the required employee contribution or underpayment and the employer remitting the required employer contribution or underpayment. Interest shall accumulate in accordance with the legislative rule 162 CSR 7 concerning retirement board refund, reinstatement, retroactive service, loan and correction of error interest factors and any accumulating interest owed on the employee and employer contributions or underpayments resulting from an employer error is the responsibility of the employer. The employer may remit total payment and the employee reimburse the employer through payroll deduction over a period equivalent to the time period during which the employer error occurred. If the correction of an error involving an underpayment to the system will result in the system correcting an erroneous underpayment from the system, the correction of the underpayment from the system shall be made only after the board receives full payment of all required employee and employer contributions or underpayments, including interest.(c)Overpayments to the system by an employer. — When mistaken or excess employer contributions, including any overpayments have been made to the system by the employer, the board shall credit the employer with an amount equal to the overpayment, to be offset against the employer’s future liability for employer contributions to the system.

Alternatively, in its full and complete discretion, the board may require the employer employing the individual to pay the individual the amounts as wages, with the board crediting the employer with a corresponding amount to offset against its future contributions to the plan. If the employer has no future liability for employer contributions to the system, the board shall refund said amount directly to the employer:Provided, That the wages paid to the individual shall not be considered compensation for any purposes of this article.

Federal law maximum benefit limitations.Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or state law, the board shall administer the retirement system in compliance with the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations under that section to the extent applicable to governmental plans (hereafter sometimes referred to as the \"415 limitation(s)\" or \"415 dollar limitation(s)\"), so that the annual benefit payable under this system to a member shall not exceed those limitations. Any annual benefit payable under this system shall be reduced or limited if necessary to an amount which does not exceed those limitations. The extent to which any annuity or other annual benefit payable under this retirement system shall be reduced, as compared with the extent to which an annuity, contributions or other benefits under any other defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans required to be taken into consideration under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be reduced, shall be proportional on a percentage basis to the reductions made in such other plans administered by the board and required to be so taken into consideration under Section 415, unless a disproportionate reduction is determined by the board to maximize the aggregate benefits payable to the member. If the reduction is under this retirement system, the board shall advise affected members or retirants of any additional limitation on the annuities or other annual benefit required by this section. For purposes of the 415 limitations, the \"limitation year\" shall be the calendar year. The 415 limitations are incorporated herein by reference, except to the extent the following provisions may modify the default provisions thereunder:(a) The annual adjustment to the 415 dollar limitations made by Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder shall apply for each limitation year. The annual adjustments to the dollar limitations under Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code which become effective: (i) After a retirant's severance from employment with the employer; or (ii) after the annuity starting date in the case of a retirant who has already commenced receiving benefits, will apply with respect to a retirant's annual benefit in any limitation year. A retirant's annual benefit payable in any limitation year from this retirement system shall in no event be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.(b) For purposes of this section, the \"annual benefit\" means a benefit that is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. Except as provided below, where a benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, the benefit shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time as such other form of benefit, using factors prescribed in the 415 limitation regulations, before applying the 415 limitations. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for: (1) Survivor benefits payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the member's benefit were paid in another form; (2) benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (3) the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this article, and the plan provides that the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this article applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.(c) Adjustment for benefit forms not subject to Section 417(e)(3). -- The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection if the form of the member's benefit is either: (1) A nondecreasing annuity (other than a straight life annuity) payable for a period of not less than the life of the member (or, in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the life of the surviving spouse); or (2) an annuity that decreases during the life of the member merely because of: (i) The death of the survivor annuitant (but only if the reduction is not below fifty percent of the benefit payable before the death of the survivor annuitant); or (ii) the cessation or reduction of Social Security supplements or qualified disability payments (as defined in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code). The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of: (I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit; and (II) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62) for that annuity starting date.(d) Adjustment for benefit forms subject to Section 417(e)(3). -- The straight life annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the member's form of benefit shall be determined under this subsection if the form of the member's benefit is other than a benefit form described in subdivision (c) of this section. In this case, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity shall be determined as follows: The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of: (1) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate specified in this retirement system and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in this retirement system for adjusting benefits in the same form; (2) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using a five and a half percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62) for that annuity starting date; and (3) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table defined in Treasury Regulation §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), divided by 1.05.(e) Benefits payable prior to age sixty-two. --(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, if the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two, the 415 dollar limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, so that the limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when the retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to an annual benefit in the amount of the applicable dollar limitation of Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code) beginning at age sixty-two.(2) The limitation reduction provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not apply if the member commencing retirement benefits before age sixty-two is a qualified participant. A qualified participant for this purpose is a participant in a defined benefit plan maintained by a state, or any political subdivision of a state, with respect to whom the service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under the defined benefit plan includes at least fifteen years of service: (i) As a full-time employee of any police or fire department organized and operated by the state or political subdivision maintaining the defined benefit plan to provide police protection, firefighting services or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of such state or political subdivision; or (ii) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.(3) The limitation reduction provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.(4) For purposes of adjusting the 415 dollar limitation for benefit commencement before age sixty-two or after age sixty-five (if the plan provides for such adjustment), no adjustment is made to reflect the probability of a member's death: (i) After the annuity starting date and before age sixty-two; or (ii) after age sixty-five and before the annuity starting date.(f) Adjustment when member has less than ten years of participation. -- In the case of a member who has less than ten years of participation in the retirement system (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii)), the 415 dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and subdivision (e) of this section) shall be reduced by multiplying the otherwise applicable limitation by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of participation in the plan (or one, if greater), and the denominator of which is ten. This adjustment shall not be applicable to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits.(g) The application of the provisions of this section shall not cause the maximum annual benefit provided to a member to be less than the member's accrued benefit as of December 31, 2008 (the end of the limitation year that is immediately prior to the effective date of the final regulations for this retirement system as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.415(a)-1(g)(2)), under provisions of the retirement system that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007, provided that such provisions satisfied the applicable requirements of statutory provisions, regulations and other published guidance relating to Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect as of the end of December 31, 2008, as described in Treasury Regulation §1.415(a)-1(g)(4). If additional benefits are accrued for a member under this retirement system after January 1, 2009, then the sum of the benefits described under the first sentence of this subsection and benefits accrued for a member after January 1, 2009, must satisfy the requirements of Section 415, taking into account all applicable requirements of the final 415 Treasury Regulations.§15-2A-6b. Federal law minimum required distributions.The requirements of this section apply to any distribution of a member’s interest and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this retirement system. This section applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 1986. Notwithstanding anything in the retirement system to the contrary, the payment of benefits under this article shall be determined and made in accordance with §401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder as applicable to governmental plans, including without limitation the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of § 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder, and the incidental benefit rule of §1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of the regulations.

The following provisions apply to payments of benefits required under this article:(a) The payment of benefits under the retirement system to any member shall be distributed to him or her not later than the required beginning date, or be distributed to him or her commencing not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations prescribed under §401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, over the life of the member or over the lives of the member and his or her beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member and his or her beneficiary:Provided, That the requirements of this section may not be construed to grant a right to a form of benefit which is not otherwise available to a particular member under this retirement system. Benefit payments under this section shall not be delayed pending, or contingent upon, receipt of an application for retirement from the member.(b) If a member dies after distribution to him or her has commenced pursuant to this section but before his or her entire interest in the retirement system has been distributed, then the remaining portion of that interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of his or her death.(c) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced, then his or her entire interest in the retirement system is to be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death, unless the provisions of subsection (d) of this section apply.(d) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced, and the member’s interest is eligible to be paid in the form of a survivor annuity to a designated beneficiary, distributions are to be made over the life of that beneficiary or over a period certain not greater than the life expectancy of that beneficiary, commencing on or before the following:(1) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or(2) If the member’s sole designated beneficiary is either the surviving spouse or a former spouse who, as an alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, is receiving 100 percent of the survivor benefit, distributions are to commence on or before the later of:(A) December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained the applicable age as set forth in the definition of required beginning date provided in §15-2A-2 of this code; or(B) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.(e) If a member dies before distribution to him or her has commenced and the survivor annuity provisions of subsection (d) of this section are not applicable, any designated beneficiary who is eligible to receive a distribution pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section may elect to have life expectancy treatment apply to the distribution for purposes of determining whether any portion of the distribution is an eligible rollover distribution:Provided, That any such election shall not delay the required distribution of the deceased member’s entire interest in the retirement system beyond December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death as required by subsection (c) of this section:Provided, however, That the election is timely made in a form acceptable to the board on or before the following:(1) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or(2) If the member’s sole designated beneficiary is either the surviving spouse or a former spouse who, as an alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, is receiving 100 percent of the survivor benefit, election of life expectancy treatment must be made on or before the earlier of:(A) The later of: (i) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died; or (ii) December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained the applicable age as set forth in the definition of required beginning date provided in §15-2A-2 of this code; or(B) October 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death.§15-2A-6c. Direct rollovers.(a) Except where otherwise stated, this section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this system, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.

Emergency Management Assistance Compact.The \"Emergency Management Assistance Compact\" is hereby approved, ratified, adopted, enacted into law and entered into by the State of West Virginia with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in accordance with its terms, in a form substantially as follows:EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACTARTICLE I - PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIESThis compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.ARTICLE II - GENERAL IMPLEMENTATIONEach party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.ARTICLE III - PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES(a) It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:(1) Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.(2) Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.(3) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.(4) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.(5) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material.(6) Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.(7) Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.(b) The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:(1) A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.(2) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.(3) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.(c) There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.ARTICLE IV - LIMITATIONSAny party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof: Provided, That it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s), whichever is longer.ARTICLE V - LICENSES AND PERMITSWhenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.ARTICLE VI - LIABILITYOfficers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.ARTICLE VII - SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTSInasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.ARTICLE VIII - COMPENSATIONEach party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.ARTICLE IX - REIMBURSEMENTAny party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests: Provided, That any aiding party state may assume, in whole or in part, such loss, damage, expense or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost: Provided, however, That any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.ARTICLE X - EVACUATIONPlans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.ARTICLE XI - IMPLEMENTATION(a) This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty days after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.(c) Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.ARTICLE XII - VALIDITYThis compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the Constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.ARTICLE XIII - ADDITIONAL PROVISIONSNothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under Section 1385 of Title 18, United States Code.ARTICLE XIV - REPORTING TO LEGISLATUREThe director of the Office of Emergency Services shall, on or before January 1, 1997, provide to the Joint Committee on Government and Finance copies of all mutual aid plans and procedures promulgated, developed or entered into after the effective date of this section.

The system shall provide for mutual assistance among the participating political subdivisions in the prevention of, response to and recovery from any disaster that results in a formal state of emergency or state of preparedness in a participating political subdivision, subject to that participating political subdivision's criteria for declaration. The system shall provide for mutual cooperation among the participating subdivisions in conducting disaster-related exercises, testing or other training activities outside actual declared emergency periods. This section provides no immunity, rights or privileges for any individual responding to a state of emergency or state of preparedness that is not requested or authorized to respond by a participating political subdivision. Participating political subdivisions will be ensured, to the fullest extent possible, eligibility for state and federal disaster funding.(b) Upon the enactment of this legislation, all political subdivisions within the state are members of the statewide mutual aid system: Provided, That a political subdivision within the state may elect not to participate or to withdraw from the system upon the enactment of an appropriate resolution by its governing body declaring that it elects not to participate in the statewide mutual aid system. A copy of any such resolution shall be provided to the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.(c) This section does not preclude participating political subdivisions from entering into supplementary agreements with another political subdivision and does not affect any other agreement to which a political subdivision may currently be a party to, or decide to be a party to.(d) \"Emergency responder\", as used in this article, shall mean anyone with special skills, qualifications, training, knowledge and experience in the public or private sectors that would be beneficial to a participating political subdivision in response to a locally declared emergency as defined in any applicable law or ordinance or authorized drill or exercises; and who is requested and authorized to respond.

Such bonds shall be authorized by a resolution of the board which shall recite an estimate by the board of such cost, and shall provide for the issuance of bonds in an amount sufficient, when sold as hereinafter provided, to produce such cost, less the amount of any grant or grants, gift or gifts, received or in the opinion of the board expected to be received from the United States of America, or from any other source.

Declaration of policy.The Legislature declares: (1) That recent technological developments make possible an enemy attack of unprecedented destructiveness, which may result in the death of inability to act of a large proportion of the membership of the Legislature; (2) that to conform in time of attack to existing legal requirements pertaining to the Legislature would be impracticable, would admit of undue delay, and would jeopardize continuity of operation of a legally constituted Legislature; and (3) that it is therefore necessary to adopt special provisions as hereinafter set out for the effective operation of the Legislature.§15-7-3. Definitions.As used in this article:(a) \"Attack\" means any action or series of actions taken by an enemy of the United States resulting in substantial damage or injury to persons or property in this state whether through sabotage, bombs, missiles, shellfire, or atomic, radiological, chemical, bacteriological, or biological means or other weapons or methods.(b) \"Unavailable\" means absent from the place of session (other than on official business of the Legislature), or unable, for physical, mental or legal reasons, to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of a legislator, whether or not such absence or inability would give rise to a vacancy under existing Constitutional or statutory provisions.§15-7-4. Designation of emergency interim successors to legislators.Each legislator shall designate not fewer than three nor more than seven emergency interim successors to his powers and duties and specify their order of succession. Each legislator shall review and, as necessary, promptly revise the designations of emergency interim successors to his powers and duties to insure that at all times there are at least three such qualified emergency interim successors.§15-7-5. Status, qualifications and term of emergency interim successors.An emergency interim successor is one who is designated for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but not the office, of a legislator. No person shall be designated or serve as an emergency interim successor unless he may under the Constitution and statutes hold the office of the legislator to whose powers and duties he is designated to succeed, but no Constitutional or statutory provision prohibiting a legislator from holding another office or prohibiting the holder of another office from being a legislator shall be applicable to an emergency interim successor. An emergency interim successor shall serve at the pleasure of the legislator designating him or of any subsequent incumbent of the legislative office.§15-7-6. Contingent method of designating emergency interim successors.Prior to an attack, if a legislator fails to designate the required minimum number of emergency interim successors within thirty days following the effective date of this article or, after such period, if for any reason the number of emergency interim successors for any legislator falls below the required minimum and remains below such minimum for a period of thirty days, then the floor leader of the same political party in the same house as such legislator shall promptly designate as many emergency interim successors as are required to achieve such minimum number, but the emergency interim successors so designated shall not have a rank in order of succession higher than that of any remaining emergency interim successor previously designated by a legislator for succession to his own powers and duties. Each emergency interim successor designated by the respective floor leaders shall serve at the pleasure of the person designating him but the legislator for whom the emergency interim successor is designated or any subsequent incumbent of his office may change the rank in order of succession or replace at his pleasure any emergency interim successor so designated.§15-7-7. Recording and publication of successor's name.Each designation of an emergency interim successor shall become effective when the legislator or floor leader authorized by section six of this article to make such designation files with the Secretary of State the successor's name, address and rank in order of succession. The removal of an emergency interim successor or change in order of succession shall become effective when the legislator or floor leader authorized by section six of this article to do so, files this information with the Secretary of State. All such data shall be open to public inspection. The Secretary of State shall inform the Governor, the director of the Office of Emergency Services, the clerk of the house concerned and all emergency interim successors of all such designations, removals and changes in order of succession. The clerk of each house shall enter all information regarding emergency interim successors for the house in its public journal at the beginning of each legislative session and shall enter all changes in membership or order of succession as soon as possible after their occurrence.§15-7-8. Oath of emergency interim successors.Promptly after designation each emergency interim successor shall take the oath required for the legislator to whose powers and duties he is designated to succeed. No other oath shall be required.§15-7-9. Duty of emergency interim successors.Each emergency interim successor shall keep himself generally informed as to the duties, procedures, practices and current business of the Legislature, and each legislator shall assist his emergency interim successors to keep themselves so informed.§15-7-10. Place of legislative session in event of attack, etc.Whenever in the event of an attack, or upon findings that an attack may be imminent, the Governor deems the place of session then prescribed to be unsafe, he may change it to any place within or without the state which he deems safer and convenient.§15-7-11. Assumption of powers and duties of legislator by emergency interim successor.If in the event of an attack a legislator is unavailable, his emergency interim successor highest in order of succession who is not unavailable shall, except for the power and duty to appoint emergency interim successors, exercise the powers and assume the duties of such legislator. An emergency interim successor shall exercise these powers and assume these duties until the incumbent legislator, and emergency interim successor higher in order of succession, or a legislator appointed or elected and legally qualified can act. Each house of the Legislature shall, in accordance with its own rules, determine who is entitled under the provisions of this article to exercise the powers and assume the duties of its members.

These assigned personnel shall continue to be covered by all employee rights and benefits provided by the assisting agency, including workers' compensation, to the same extent as though such personnel were functioning within the normal scope of their duties.(d) No request or agreement between the heads of law-enforcement agencies, or the heads of campus police, made or entered into pursuant to this article shall remain in force or effect until a copy of said request or agreement is filed with the office of the circuit clerk of the county or counties in which the law-enforcement agencies, or the campus police, involved operate.

BLUE ALERT PLAN.§15-3C-1. Short title.This article shall be known and may be cited as the \"Blue Alert Plan\".§15-3C-2. Findings and declarations relative to the \"Blue Alert Plan\".(a) The Legislature finds that:(1) Public alerts can be one of the most effective tools in locating criminal suspects;(2) The disappearance of a law-enforcement officer in the line of duty or a person who kills or inflicts a life-threatening injury upon a law-enforcement officer poses a serious threat to the safety of the public, and the rapid dissemination of information, including a description of the missing law-enforcement officer, suspect, or suspects, details of the crime, and of any vehicles involved, to the citizens of the affected community and region is, therefore, critical;(3) Alerted to the situation, the citizenry become an extensive network of eyes and ears serving to assist law enforcement in quickly locating and safely notifying the law-enforcement community of the location of the missing law-enforcement officer, suspect, or suspects;(4) The most effective method of immediately notifying the public of the location of a missing law-enforcement officer or a person who kills or inflicts a life-threatening injury upon a law-enforcement officer is through the broadcast media; and(5) All forms of developing technologies are required to assist law enforcement in rapidly responding to these alerts and are an additional tool for assuring the well-being and safety of our law-enforcement officers and the public. Thus, the use of traffic video recording and monitoring devices for the purpose of surveillance of a suspect vehicle adds yet another set of eyes to assist law enforcement and aid in locating a missing law-enforcement officer or the apprehension of a suspect or suspects who kill or inflict a life-threatening injury upon a law-enforcement officer.(b) The Legislature declares that given the successes other states and regions have experienced in using broadcast media alerts to quickly locate a missing law-enforcement officer or locate and safely apprehend a suspect or suspects who kill or inflict a life-threatening injury upon a law-enforcement officer, and, with the recent development of highway video recording and monitoring systems, it is altogether fitting and proper, and within the public interest, to establish this program for West Virginia.§15-3C-3. Establishment of \"Blue Alert\" program.(a) The Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police shall establish a Blue Alert program authorizing the broadcast media, upon notice from the West Virginia State Police, to broadcast an alert to inform the public of a law-enforcement officer who is missing in the line of duty or a suspect or suspects who kill or inflict a life-threatening injury upon a law- enforcement officer, subject to the criteria established in §15-3C-4 of this code.

Short title.This article shall be known and may be cited as the Missing Persons Act.§15-3D-2. Findings.The Legislature finds that:(1) The ability of law-enforcement agencies to rapidly respond in the hours following the discovery that an individual is missing is a crucial factor in the likelihood that the person will ultimately be located and recovered. The prompt communication of detailed information to the public through emergency broadcast systems and media outlets, including through social media platforms and missing persons databases, can be one of the most effective tools in a missing persons investigation.(2) A number of national and state-level databases are available to allow law-enforcement agencies and medical examiners to electronically share key information with other law-enforcement agencies and the public related to the investigation of a missing person or unidentified human remains.(3) In light of technological developments, it is imperative that all law-enforcement agencies in West Virginia follow certain minimum procedures for responding to missing persons complaints and submit key information to national and state-level databases in a timely manner.§15-2-55.

Findings and declarations relative to Green Alert Plan.(a) The Legislature finds that:(1) According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 20 veterans commit suicide each day across the country;(2) While veterans make up less than nine percent of the total U.S. population, tragically, they account for 19 percent of all suicides in America;(3) By establishing the Green Alert Plan, law enforcement will be provided with additional tools that will help them in responding to an at-risk veteran’s disappearance and place an emphasis on the risk of suicide for veterans with a service-related condition;(4) The Green Alert Plan would also allow for a more rapid dissemination of information on the missing at-risk veteran to the public, who, having been alerted to the situation, now become an extensive network of eyes and ears serving to assist law enforcement in quickly locating and safely recovering a missing at-risk veteran, and potentially saving them serious injury or suicide; and(5) Given the success of both the Amber and Silver Alert systems, expanding the program to include at-risk veterans is imperative to help those who have served.(b) The Legislature declares that creating a Green Alert is a way to prevent more tragedies and help ensure our veterans get back home safely.§15-3E-3.

      "text": "Legislative findings.(a) The purpose of \"The Child Protection Act of 2006\" is to put in place a series of programs, criminal law revisions, and other reforms to provide and promote the ability of the children of this state to live their lives without being exposed and subjected to neglect and physical and sexual abuse. The targeted increases in terms of incarceration, enhanced treatment, post-release supervision, and new approaches toward the state’s child protection system will, in the aggregate, strengthen government’s ability to address this most serious problem. The Legislature finds that the broad reaching measures encompassed in this Act will provide for greater intervention among and punishment and monitoring of individuals who create a risk to our children’s safety and well-being.(b) The Legislature further finds that the following reforms implemented as part of this Act will provide protections to the children of this state and are all important to eliminate risks to children and are essential elements of \"The Child Protection Act of 2006\":(1) Creating a special unit in the State Police specializing in the investigation of child abuse and neglect — §15-2-15 of this code;(2) Modifying the Sex Offender Registration Act to ensure more effective registration, identification, and monitoring of persons convicted of sexual offenses — §15-12-1et seq. of this code;(3) Establishing the Child Abuse and Neglect Registry, requiring the registry to disclose information to certain state and local officials — §15-13-1et seq. of this code;(4) Providing for coded driver’s licenses and nondriver identification cards to more easily identify sexually violent predators — §17B-2-3 of this code;(5) Prohibiting contractors and service providers convicted of certain offenses from accessing school grounds and providing for the release of criminal history information by the central abuse registry to county school boards — §18-5-15c of this code;(6) Establishing a task force to study the feasibility of constructing separate correctional facilities for the incarceration and treatment of sex offenders — §25-1-22 of this code;(7) Requiring the State Police and the Department of Human Services to maintain statewide child abuse and neglect statistical indices of all convictions and allegations, respectively — §15-2-15 and §49-2-813 of this code;(8) Providing for increased terms of incarceration for first degree sexual assault and first degree sexual abuse committed against children under the age of 12 — §61-8B-3 and §61-8B-7 of this code;(9) Eliminating eligibility of certain sex offenders for probation, home incarceration, and alternative sentences and providing for enhanced terms of incarceration for certain subsequent sex offenses committed by recidivist sex offenders — §61-8B-9a and §61-8B-9b of this code;(10) Providing for polygraph examinations for certain sex offenders on probation, parole, or supervised release — §62-11D-1et seq. of this code;(11) Providing for electronic monitoring of certain sex offenders on probation, parole, and supervised release — §62-11D-1et seq. of this code;(12) Establishing a task force to develop measures aimed at managing sexually violent predators released from confinement — §62-11E-1et seq. of this code;(13) Making psychiatric evaluations a condition of probation eligibility for certain sex offenders (- §62-12-2 of this code;(14) Authorizing the Department of Human Services to establish qualifications for sex offender treatment programs and counselors — §62-12-2 and §62-12-26 of this code;(15) Providing for extended supervision of certain offenders and supervised release requirements for sexually violent offenders — §62-12-26 of this code; and(16) Providing for prerelease risk assessments of certain sex offenders — §62-12-27 of this code.(c) In addition, the Legislature finds that those enhanced terms of incarceration and post-conviction measures provided for in this Act which impact certain offenders convicted of sexual offenses against adults are necessary and appropriate to protect children from neglect and physical and sexual abuse given that: (1) Clinical research indicates that a substantial percentage of sexual offenders \"cross over\" among age groups in selecting their victims; (2) many of the risk factors prevalent among sex offenders that \"cross over\" (e.g., substance abuse, lack of empathy toward victim, inability to control inappropriate impulses, childhood abuse) also are prevalent among perpetrators of child abuse and neglect; and (3) enhanced terms of incarceration, post-conviction supervision, monitoring,` and treatment measures will enable the criminal justice system to identify and address those \"cross over\" offenders before they can victimize additional children.",
