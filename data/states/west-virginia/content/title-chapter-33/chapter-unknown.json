Payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except: (A) Where the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of the reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or (B) where the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured, has assumed the policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under the policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to payees.(2) The reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against the ceding insurer on the contract reinsured within a reasonable time after the claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding. During the pendency of the claim, any assuming insurer may investigate the claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where the claim is to be adjudicated any defenses which it deems available to the ceding insurer or its liquidator. The expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. Where two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose a defense to the claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though the expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer.(d) Any licensed insurer may accept reinsurance for the same kinds of insurance and within the same limits as it is authorized to transact direct insurance.(e) A licensed insurer may reinsure all or substantially all of its risks on property or lives located in West Virginia, or substantially all of a major class thereof, with another insurer by an assumption reinsurance agreement: Provided, That the assumption reinsurance agreement shall not become effective unless filed in advance with and approved in writing by the Commissioner: Provided, however, That if a licensed insurer is deemed by the Commissioner to be in hazardous financial condition, as defined in article thirty-four-a of this chapter, or an administrative or judicial proceeding has been instituted against it for the purpose of liquidating, reorganizing or conserving the insurer, and the transfer of the contracts of insurance is determined by the Commissioner to be in the best interest of the policyholders, the Commissioner may by written order waive the advance filing and approval required by this section, which waiver may include a form of implied consent and adequate notification to the policyholder of the circumstances requiring the transfer.(f) The Commissioner shall approve a reinsurance agreement within one hundred twenty days after the filing of same unless he or she finds that it is inequitable to the licensed insurer, its owners or its policyholders or would substantially reduce the protection or service to its policyholders. If the Commissioner does not approve the agreement, he or she shall notify the insurer in writing specifying his or her reasons therefor. If the Commissioner does not disapprove the agreement within one hundred twenty days, the agreement shall be deemed approved.(g) A filing may not be made pursuant to this section unless the reinsurance agreement is certified under oath by responsible officers of the reinsurer and the reinsured to contain the entire agreement between the parties to the reinsurance agreement.(h) The Commissioner shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter twenty-nine-a of this code for the implementation and administration of the provisions of this section to include, but not be limited to, the type of assumption agreements subject to the provisions of this section, their content and the standards the Commissioner may utilize in reviewing the agreements.(i) Any insurer subject to this section is also subject to the provisions of article thirty-eight of this chapter.",

      "text": "Construction of policies.(a) Every insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy and as amplified, extended or modified by any rider, endorsement or application attached to and made a part of the policy: Provided, That the word \"physician\" when used in any accident and sickness policy or other contract providing for the payment of surgical procedures shall be construed to include a physician, dentist or chiropodist-podiatrist performing surgical procedures or chiropractor performing other health care services within the scope of his or her professional license: Provided, however, That any policy of insurance or medical or health service contract providing for payment or reimbursement for any professional services pertaining to eye examination, refractions or the fitting of corrective lenses shall be construed to include payment or reimbursement for professional services rendered by either a duly licensed physician or a duly licensed optometrist, within the scope of their respective professional licenses, and that the insured or subscriber have freedom of choice to select either a physician or an optometrist to render or perform professional services.(b) The Legislature finds:(1) That consumers and insurers both benefit from the legislative mandate that the Insurance Commissioner approve the forms used and the rates charged by insurance companies in this state;(2) That certain classes of persons are seeking refunds of insurance premiums and seeking to void exclusions and other policy provisions on the basis that insurance companies allegedly failed to provide or demonstrate a reduction in premiums charged in relation to certain terms or exclusions incorporated into policies of insurance;(3) That historically, as a prerequisite to a rate or form being approved, neither the Legislature nor the Insurance Commissioner has ever required that the insurer demonstrate that there was a specific premium reduction for certain exclusions incorporated into policies of insurance;(4) That the provisions of this chapter were enacted with the intent of requiring the filing of all rates and forms with the Insurance Commissioner to enable the Insurance Commissioner to review and regulate rates and forms in a fair and consistent manner;(5) That the provisions of this chapter do not provide and were not intended to provide the basis for monetary damages in the form of premium refunds or partial premium refunds when the form used and the rates charged by the insurance company have been approved by the Insurance Commissioner;(6) That actions seeking premium refunds or partial premium refunds have a severe and negative impact upon insurers operating in this state by imposing unexpected liabilities when insurers have relied upon the Insurance Commissioner's approval of the forms used and the rates charged insureds; and(7) That it is in the best interest of the citizens of this state to ensure a stable insurance market.(c) Nothing in this chapter may be construed as requiring specific line item premium discounts or rate adjustments corresponding to any exclusion, condition, definition, term or limitation in any policy of insurance, including policies incorporating statutorily mandated benefits or optional benefits which as a matter of law must be offered. Where any insurance policy form, including any endorsement thereto, has been approved by the commissioner, and the corresponding rate has been approved by the commissioner, there is a presumption that the policy forms and rate structure are in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of the Legislature that the amendments in this section enacted during the regular session of two thousand two are: (1) A clarification of existing law as previously enacted by the Legislature, including, but not limited to, the provisions of subsection (k), section thirty-one of this article; and, (2) specifically intended to clarify the law and correct a misinterpretation and misapplication of the law that was expressed in the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in the case of Mitchell v. Broadnax, 537 S.E.2d 882 (W.Va. 2000). These amendments are a clarification of the existing law as previously enacted by this Legislature.",

In the absence of an agreement with the creditor to the contrary, the other person shall not be entitled to any distribution, however, until the amount paid to the creditor on the undertaking plus the distributions paid on the claim from the insurer's estate to the creditor equals the amount of the entire claim of the creditor. Any excess received by the creditor shall be held by him or her in trust for such other person. The term \"other person\", as used in this section, is not intended to apply to a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.(f) Unless such claim is filed in the manner and within the time provided in sections eighteen and thirty of this article, it shall not be entitled to filing or allowance and no action may be maintained thereon. In the liquidation, pursuant to the provisions of this article, of any domestic insurer which has issued policies insuring the lives of persons, the commissioner shall, within thirty days after the last day set for the filing of claims, make a list of the persons who have not filed proofs of claim with him or her and to whom, according to the books of the insurer, there are amounts owing under such policies and he or she shall set opposite the name of each person the amount so owing to the person. Each person whose name appears upon the list shall be considered to have duly filed, prior to the last day set for the filing of claims, a claim for the amount set opposite his or her name on the list.(g)(1) Claims founded upon unliquidated or undetermined demands must be filed within the time limit provided in this article for the filing of claims, but claims founded upon such demands shall not share in any distribution to creditors of a person proceeded against under section nineteen-a of this article until the claims have been definitely determined, proved and allowed. Thereafter, the claims shall share ratably with other claims of the same class in all subsequent distributions.(2) An unliquidated or undetermined claim or demand within the meaning of this article shall be considered to be any claim or demand upon which a right of action has accrued at the date of the order of liquidation and upon which the liability has not been determined or the amount thereof liquidated.(h) The commissioner may require, as a condition of payment of the final liquidation dividend to a lender, or his or her assignee, who has filed a claim for an unearned premium as an assignee of the insured for valuable consideration:(1) That such assignee of the insured shall assign to the liquidator all his or her right, title and interest in any unsatisfied debt of the insured to the assignee, pertaining to policies of the insolvent insurer, remaining unpaid after crediting the final liquidation dividend, if the amount of the unsatisfied debt is less than $100.01; and(2) That all of the documents giving rise to the debt be delivered to him or her.(i) The commissioner may determine whether or not it will be feasible to attempt to collect any assigned debt. If the commissioner determines not to pursue collection of any such debt, he or she shall file a declaration to that effect with the liquidation court and be relieved of any further responsibility in respect to the debt.(j) As used in this section, \"insured\" means a natural person who purchased insurance or coverage from the insolvent insurer for personal, family, or household purposes.",

Where the insurance covers properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed both in and out of this state and this state is the insured's home state, the sum payable shall be computed on that portion of the gross premiums allocated to this state, plus an amount equal to the portion of the gross premiums allocated to other states or territories on the basis of the tax rates and fees applicable to properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed outside of this state, and less the amount of gross premiums allocated to this state and returned to the insured due to cancellation of policy: Provided, That the surcharge imposed by section thirty-three, article three of this chapter on surplus lines policies shall no longer be effective with respect to premium attributable to coverage under such policies for periods after June 30, 2011: Provided, however, That twelve per cent of taxes collected under this subsection with respect to premium attributable to coverage under such policies after June 30, 2011, shall be disbursed and distributed in accordance with subsection (d), section thirty-three, article three of this chapter and eighty-eight per cent in accordance with subdivision two, subsection (f) of this section. The tax on any portion of the premium unearned at termination of insurance having been credited by the state to the licensee shall be returned to the policyholder directly by the surplus lines licensee or through the producing broker, if any.(b) The individual insurance producer may not:(1) Pay directly or indirectly the tax or any portion thereof, either as an inducement to the policyholder to purchase the insurance or for any other reason; or(2) Rebate all or part of the tax or the surplus lines licensee's commission, either as an inducement to the policyholder to purchase the insurance or for any reason.(c) The surplus lines licensee may charge the prospective policyholder a fee for the cost of underwriting, issuing, processing, inspecting, service or auditing the policy for placement with the surplus lines insurer if:(1) The service is required by the surplus lines insurer;(2) The service is actually provided by the individual insurance producer or the cost of the service is actually incurred by the surplus lines licensee; and(3) The provision or cost of the service is reasonable, documented and verifiable.(d) The surplus lines licensee shall make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the policyholder of:(1) The total amount of premium for the policy;(2) Any fee charged;(3) The total amount of any fee charged; and(4) The total amount of tax on the premium and fee.(e) The clear and conspicuous written disclosure required by subdivision (4) of this subsection is subject to the record maintenance requirements of section eight of this article.(f)(1) This tax is imposed for the purpose of providing additional revenue for municipal policemen's and firemen's pension and relief funds and additional revenue for volunteer and part-volunteer fire companies and departments. This tax is required to be paid and remitted, on a calendar year basis and in quarterly estimated installments due and payable on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month succeeding the close of the quarter in which they accrued, except for the fourth quarter, in respect of which taxes shall be due and payable and final computation of actual total liability for the prior calendar year shall be made, less credit for the three quarterly estimated payments prior made, and filed with the annual return to be made on or before March 1 of the succeeding year. Provisions of this chapter relating to the levy, imposition and collection of the regular premium tax are applicable to the levy, imposition and collection of this tax to the extent that the provisions are not in conflict with this section.(2) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, all taxes remitted to the commissioner pursuant to subdivision one of this subsection shall be paid by him or her into a special account in the State Treasury, designated Municipal Pensions and Protection Fund, or pursuant to section eighteen-b, article twenty-two, chapter eight of this code, the Municipal Pensions Security Fund, and after appropriation by the Legislature, shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c), section fourteen-d, article three of this chapter. The surplus lines licensee shall return to the policyholder the tax on any unearned portion of the premium returned to the policyholder because of cancellation of policy.(g) In determining the amount of gross premiums taxable in this state for a placement of surplus lines insurance covering properties, risks or exposures only partially located or to be performed in this state, the tax due shall be computed on the portions of the premiums which are attributable to properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed in this state and which relates to the kinds of insurance being placed as determined by reference to an appropriate allocation table.(1) If a policy covers more than one classification:(A) For any portion of the coverage identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using the allocation schedule for the corresponding portion of the premium;(B) For any portion of the coverage not identified by a classification on the allocation schedule, the tax shall be computed by using an alternative equitable method of allocation for the property or risk;(C) For any portion of the coverage where the premium is indivisible, the tax shall be computed by using the method of allocation which pertains to the classification describing the predominant coverage.(2) If the information provided by the surplus lines licensee is insufficient to substantiate the method of allocation used by the surplus lines licensee, or if the commissioner determines that the licensee's method is incorrect, the commissioner shall determine the equitable and appropriate amount of tax due to this state as follows:(A) By use of the allocation schedule where the risk is appropriately identified in the schedule;(B) Where the allocation schedule does not identify a classification appropriate to the coverage, the commissioner may give significant weight to documented evidence of the underwriting bases and other criteria used by the insurer. The commissioner may also consider other available information to the extent sufficient and relevant, including the percentage of the insured's physical assets in this state, the percentage of the insured's sales in this state, the percentage of income or resources derived from this state, and the amount of premium tax paid to another jurisdiction for the policy.(h) The commissioner is authorized to participate in a clearinghouse established through NIMA or in a similar allocation procedure for the purpose of collecting and disbursing to signatory states any funds collected pursuant to this section that are allocable to properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed outside of this state: Provided, That twelve per cent of any moneys received from a clearinghouse or through a similar allocation procedure is subject to the provisions of subsection (d), section thirty-three, article three of this chapter and eighty-eight per cent of such moneys is subject to the provisions of subdivision (2), subsection (f) of this section: Provided, however, That to the extent other states where portions of the properties, risks or exposures reside have failed to enter into NIMA or a similar allocation procedure with this state, the net premium tax collected shall be retained by this state and shall be disbursed and distributed in the same manner as moneys received through a clearinghouse or similar allocation procedure.(i) Collection of tax.If the tax owed by a surplus lines licensee under this section has been collected and is not paid within the time prescribed, the same shall be recoverable in a suit brought by the commissioner against the surplus lines licensee. The commissioner may charge interest for any unpaid tax, fee, financial assessment or penalty, or portion thereof: Provided, That interest may not be charged on interest.

The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by subdivision (3) of this subsection.(3) The viatical provider shall deliver a copy of the medical release required under paragraph (B), subdivision (1) of this subsection, a copy of the viator's application for the viatical settlement contract, the notice required under subdivision (2) of this subsection and a request for verification of coverage to the insurer that issued the life insurance policy that is the subject of the viatical transaction. The request for verification of coverage shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.(4) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage within thirty calendar days of the date the request is received and shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract or possible fraud. The insurer shall accept a request for verification made on an approved form or any facsimile or electronic copy of such request and any accompanying authorization signed by the viator.

Rescission by the viator may be conditioned upon the viator both giving notice and repaying to the viatical settlement provider within the rescission period all proceeds of the settlement and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid by or on behalf of the viatical settlement provider in connection with or as a result of the viatical settlement. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the viatical settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded, subject to repayment to the viatical settlement provider or purchaser of all viatical settlement proceeds, any premiums, loans and loan interest that have been paid by the viatical settlement provider or purchaser, which shall be paid within sixty calendar days of the death of the insured. In the event of any rescission, if the viatical settlement provider has paid commissions or other compensation to a viatical settlement broker in connection with the rescinded transaction, the viatical settlement broker shall refund all such commissions and compensation to the viatical settlement provider within five business days following receipt of written demand from the viatical settlement provider, which demand shall be accompanied by either the viator's notice of rescission if rescinded at the election of the viator, or notice of the death of the insured if rescinded by reason of the death of the insured within the applicable rescission period.(d) The viatical settlement provider shall instruct the viator to send the executed documents required to effect the change in ownership, assignment or change in beneficiary directly to the independent escrow agent.

Upon payment of the settlement proceeds into the escrow account, the escrow agent shall deliver the original change in ownership assignment or change in beneficiary forms to the viatical settlement provider or related provider trust or other designated representative of the viatical settlement provider. Upon the escrow agent's receipt of the acknowledgment of the properly completed transfer of ownership, assignment or designation of beneficiary from the insurance company, the escrow agent shall pay the settlement proceeds to the viator.(e) Failure to tender consideration to the viator for the viatical settlement contract within the time set forth in the disclosure pursuant to subdivision (7), subsection (a), section eight of this article renders the viatical settlement contract voidable by the viator for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by the viator. Funds shall be deemed sent by a viatical settlement provider to a viator as of the date that the escrow agent either releases funds for wire transfer to the viator or places a check for delivery to the viator via United State Postal Service or other nationally recognized delivery service.(f) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured by the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker after the viatical settlement has occurred shall only be made by the viatical settlement provider or broker licensed in this state or its authorized representatives and shall be limited to once every three months for insureds with a life expectancy of more than one year, and to no more than once per month for insureds with a life expectancy of one year or less. The provider or broker shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the viatical settlement contract is entered into.

A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (i) until at least age fifty, or (ii) in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption \"Incontestable\":\"After this policy has been in force for a period of two years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application.(2) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after two years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.\"(c) A provision as follows:\"Grace Period: A grace period of __________________ (insert a number not less than '7' for weekly premium policies, '10' for monthly premium policies and '31' for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.\"(d) A provision as follows:\"Reinstatement: If any renewal premium be not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, as subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy: Provided, That if the insurer or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval of such application by the insurer, or lacking such approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.\"(e) A provision as follows:\"Notice of Claim: Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at ____________________ (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.\"In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences of the above provision:\"Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least two years, he shall, at least once in every six months after having given notice of claim give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability, in whole or in part, by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such notice is actually given.\"(f) A provision as follows:\"Claim Forms: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.\"(g) A provision as follows:\"Proof of Loss: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise required.\"(h) A provision as follows:\"Time of Payment of Claims: Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid _____________ (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.\"(i) A provision as follows: \"Payment of Claims: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment. If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.\"The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the foregoing provisions at the option of the insurer:\"If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $_________ (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000), to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.\"\"Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.\"(j) A provision as follows:\"Physical Examinations and Autopsy: The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.\"(k) A provision as follows:\"Legal Actions: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.\"(l) A provision as follows:\"Change of Beneficiary: Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.\"The first clause of this provision, relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.",

      "text": "Optional policy provisions.Except as provided in section six of this article, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state shall contain provisions respecting the matters set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the same appear in this section: Provided, That the insurer may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the commissioner which is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.(a) A provision as follows:\"Change of Occupation: If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.\"(b) A provision as follows:\"Misstatement of Age: If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.\"(c) A provision as follows:\"Other Insurance in This Insurer: If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for ____________ (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $____________ (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to his estate.\"Or, in lieu thereof:\"Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.\"Provided that no policy hereafter issued for delivery in this state which provides, with or without other benefits, for the payment of benefits or reimbursement for expenses with respect to hospitalization, nursing care, medical or surgical examination or treatment, or ambulance transportation shall contain any provision for a reduction of such benefits or reimbursement, or any provision for avoidance of the policy, on account of other insurance of such nature carried by the same insured with the same or another insurer.(d) A provision as follows:\"Insurance with Other Insurers: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined.\"The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"other valid coverage,\" approved as to form by the commissioner, which definitions shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulations by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provisions with respect to any insured any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be \"other valid coverage\" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as \"other valid coverage.\"(e) A provision as follows:\"Relation of Earnings to Insurance: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.\"The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of \"valid loss of time coverage,\" approved as to form by the commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.(f) A provision as follows:\"Unpaid Premium: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premiums then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.\"(g) A provision as follows:\"Return of Premium on Cancellation: If the insured cancels this policy, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation.\"(h) A provision as follows:\"Conformity with State Statutes: Any provision of this policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes.\"(i) A provision as follows:\"Illegal Occupation: The insurer shall not be liable for any loss to which a contributing cause was the insured's commission of or attempt to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured's being engaged in an illegal occupation.\"(j) A provision as follows:\"Intoxicants and Narcotics: The insurer shall not be liable for any loss sustained or contracted in consequence of the insured's being intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic unless administered on the advice of a physician.\"",

Rates may not be unfairly discriminatory between risks involving essentially the same hazards and expense elements. The rates may be fixed in an amount sufficient to furnish a reasonable margin for profit after provisions to account for: (i) Probable losses as indicated by experience within and without this state; (ii) exposure to loss under policies; (iii) allocations to reserves; (iv) costs participating insurance; (v) operating costs; and (vi) other items of expense fairly attributable to the operation of a title insurance business.(2) (A) Policies may be grouped into classes for the establishment of rates. A title insurance policy that is unusually hazardous to the title insurance company because of an alleged defect or irregularity in the title insured or because of uncertainty regarding the proper interpretation or application of the law involved may be classified separately according to the facts of each case.(B) Title insurance companies shall file separate rate schedules for commercial and noncommercial risks. The Insurance Commissioner shall promulgate rules regarding the requirements of this subsection which shall give due consideration to the nature of commercial transactions and the need for greater protections for consumers in noncommercial transactions.(3) Title insurance rates may not include charges for abstracting, record searching, certificates regarding the record title, escrow services, closing services and other related services that may be offered or furnished or the cost and expenses of examinations of titles.(f) Except to the extent necessary to meet the provisions of subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, uniformity among insurers in any matters within the scope of this section is neither required nor prohibited.(g) Rates made in accordance with this section may be used subject to the provisions of this article.",

The finding of fact by the commissioner must specify the relevant tests used to determine whether a lack of a reasonable degree of competition exists and the results thereof. In the absence of such findings of fact by the commissioner, a competitive market is presumed to exist.(b) Every filing shall state the proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated. When a filing is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports the filing and the commissioner does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the requirements of this article, he or she shall require the insurer to furnish the information upon which it supports the filing and in that event the waiting period shall commence as of the date the information is furnished. The information furnished in support of a filing may include: (1) The experience or judgment of the insurer or rating organization making the filing; (2) the experience or judgment of the insurer or rating organization in the territorial rate areas established by §33-20-3(c)(2) of this code; (3) its interpretation of any statistical data it relies upon; (4) the experience of other insurers or rating organizations; or (5) any other relevant factors.

Any person or organization may file with the commissioner a signed statement declaring and supporting his or her or its position concerning the filing. Upon receipt of the statement prior to the effective date of the filing, the commissioner shall mail or deliver a copy of the statement to the filer, which may file a reply as it may desire to make. This section is not applicable to any memorandum or statement of any kind by any employee of the commissioner.(c) An insurer may satisfy its obligation to make a filing by becoming a member of, or a subscriber to, a licensed rating organization which makes filings and by authorizing the commissioner to accept filings on its behalf: Provided, That nothing contained in this article shall be construed as requiring any insurer to become a member of or a subscriber to any rating organization.(d) The commissioner shall review filings as soon as reasonably possible after they have been made in order to determine whether they meet the requirements of this article.(e) Subject to the exceptions specified in §33-20-4(f), §33-20-4(g) and §33-20-4(h) of this code, each filing shall be on file for a waiting period of 60 days before it becomes effective. Upon written application by an insurer or rating organization, the commissioner may authorize a filing which he or she has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article unless disapproved by the commissioner within the waiting period.(f) Any special filing with respect to a surety bond required by law or by court or executive order or by order, rule, or regulation of a public body, not covered by a previous filing, shall become effective when filed and shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article until the commissioner reviews the filing and so long thereafter as the filing remains in effect.(g) Specific inland marine rates on risks specially rated by a rating organization shall become effective when filed and shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article until the commissioner reviews the filing and so long thereafter as the filing remains in effect.(h) Except as provided in §33-20-4(a)(3) of this code, rates for commercial lines property and casualty risks must be filed with the commissioner and the filings need not be approved by the commissioner. The commissioner may request additional information to ensure compliance with applicable statutory standards, but if the commissioner does not disapprove the filing within the initial 30-day period after receipt, the rate filing will become effective upon first usage after filing: Provided, That the commissioner may at any time thereafter, after notice and for cause shown, disapprove any rate filing.(i) Under legislative rules, the commissioner may, by written order, suspend or modify the requirement of filing as to any kind of insurance, subdivision, or combination thereof, or as to classes of risks, the rates for which cannot practicably be filed before they are used. These orders and rules shall be made known to insurers and rating organizations affected thereby. The commissioner may make any examination he or she may consider advisable to ascertain whether any rates affected by an order meet the standards set forth in §33-20-3(b) of this code.(j) Upon the written application of the insured, stating his or her reasons therefor, filed with and approved by the commissioner, a rate in excess of that provided by a filing otherwise applicable may be used on any specific risks.(k) No insurer shall make or issue a contract or policy except in accordance with the filings which are in effect for that insurer as provided in this article. This subsection does not apply to contracts or policies for risks as to which filings are not required.(l) In instances when an insurer files a request for an increase of automobile liability insurance rates in the amount of 15 percent or more, the Insurance Commissioner shall provide notice of the increase with the Office of the Secretary of State to be filed in the State Register and shall provide interested persons the opportunity to comment on the request up to the time the commissioner approves or disapproves the rate increase.(m) For purposes of this section, “commercial” means commercial lines as defined in §33-6-8(e)(2) of this code.",

Notice of proposed changes in such rules shall be given to subscribers. Each rating organization shall furnish its rating services without discrimination to its members and subscribers. The reasonableness of any rule or regulation in its application to subscribers, or the refusal of any rating organization to admit an insurer as a subscriber, shall, at the request of any subscriber or any such insurer, be reviewed by the commissioner. If, after notice and hearing, the commissioner finds that the rule or regulation is unreasonable in its application to subscribers, he shall order that such rule or regulation shall not be applicable to subscribers. If the rating organization fails to grant or reject an insurer's application for subscribership within thirty days after it was made, the insurer may request a review by the commissioner as if the application had been rejected. If, after notice and hearing, the commissioner finds that the insurer has been refused admittance to the rating organization as a subscriber without justification, he shall order the rating organization to admit the insurer as a subscriber.

Such written requests for classification revision must be made by the chief official of the city, town or fire district and must outline the specific changes in conditions in the entity that would warrant a classification revision.(A) If the changed conditions in the entity do not warrant a revision to the applicable classification, the rating organization must provide the entity with a written response outlining the reasons why such changes in condition will not impact the classification.(B) If the changed conditions in the entity indicate a potential revision to the applicable classification, the rating organization may request reasonable additional information from the entity. Upon receipt of such information, and upon determination that a classification revision may be indicated, the rating organization must schedule a survey of the entity.(2) Complete any required survey, analysis, and written evaluation of the entity and develop any applicable classification revision within sixty days after all necessary information about changed conditions has been received in writing by the rating organization from the entity.(3) Advise its participating insurers within sixty days after the revised public fire protection classification has been developed reflecting the changed conditions in the entity.(4) Have the option to request a reasonable extension of the above described time frames from the Insurance Commissioner if unusual conditions exist including, but not limited to, unusual weather conditions or difficulty in scheduling a mutually convenient survey time.(5) File the following with the Insurance Commissioner:(A) Within thirty days of its publication:(i) A copy of a current list of all classifications established in West Virginia. Such list shall be published on at least a quarterly basis and;(ii) All changes in established classifications during the previous month.

Such purposes shall not include more liberal powers than are granted by this article: Provided, That any lawful, social, intellectual, educational, charitable, benevolent, moral, fraternal or religious advantages may be set forth among the purposes of the society; and(3) The names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences and official titles of all the officers, trustees, directors, or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control of the management of the affairs and funds of the society for the first year or until the ensuing election at which all such officers shall be elected by the supreme legislative or governing body, which election shall be held not later than one year from the date of the issuance of the permanent certificate.(b) Such articles of incorporation, duly certified copies of the Constitution, laws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications therefor, and circulars to be issued by the society and a bond conditioned upon the return to applicants of the advanced payments if the organization is not completed within one year, such bond to be in an amount to be determined by the commissioner not to exceed the sum of $25,000 with sureties approved by the commissioner, shall be filed with the commissioner, who may require such further information as he deems necessary. All documents filed are to be in the English language. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this article and all provisions of law have been complied with, the commissioner shall approve same in writing, whereupon the incorporators may file such approved articles with the Secretary of State of this state and receive a certificate of incorporation in the same manner as such certificates are issued to other nonstock corporations.(c) No certificate granted under the provisions of this section shall be valid after one year from its date or after such further period, not exceeding one year, as may be authorized by the commissioner upon cause shown, unless the five hundred applicants hereinafter required have been secured and the organization has been completed as herein provided. The articles of incorporation and all other proceedings thereunder shall become null and void in one year from the date of the certificate, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society shall have completed its organization and received a license as hereinafter provided.(d) Upon receipt of the certificate of incorporation, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates as provided by its Constitution and laws, and shall issue to each such applicant a receipt for the amount so collected.

Said advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one year, as herein provided, such premiums shall be returned to said applicants.(e) The commissioner may make such examination and require such further information as he deems advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, he shall issue to the society a license to transact insurance pursuant to the provisions of this article. The license shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of such license. The commissioner shall cause a record of such license to be made.

This procedure shall be administered at no cost to the subscriber. An HMO subscriber grievance procedure shall include the following:(1) Both informal and formal steps shall be available to resolve the grievance. A grievance is not considered formal until a written grievance is executed by the subscriber or completed on forms prescribed and received by the HMO;(2) Each HMO shall designate at least one grievance coordinator who is responsible for the implementation of the HMO's grievance procedure;(3) Phone numbers shall be specified by the HMO for the subscriber to call to present an informal grievance or to contact the grievance coordinator.

There must be an adequate number of phone lines to handle incoming grievances;(4) An address shall be included for written grievances;(5) Each level of the grievance procedure shall have some person with problem-solving authority to participate in each step of the grievance procedure;(6) The HMO shall process the formal written subscriber grievance through all phases of the grievance procedure in a reasonable length of time not to exceed sixty days, unless the subscriber and HMO mutually agree to extend the time frame. If the complaint involves the collection of information outside the service area, the HMO has thirty additional days to process the subscriber complaint through all phases of the grievance procedure. The time limitations prescribed in this subdivision requiring completion of the grievance process within sixty days shall be tolled after the HMO has notified the subscriber, in writing, that additional information is required in order to properly complete review of the grievance. Upon receipt by the HMO of the additional information requested, the time for completion of the grievance process set forth in this subdivision shall resume;(7) The subscriber grievance procedure shall state that the subscriber has the right to appeal to the Commissioner. There shall be the additional requirement that subscribers under a group contract between the HMO and a department or division of the state shall first appeal to the state agency responsible for administering the relevant program, and if either of the two parties are not satisfied with the outcome of the appeal, they may then appeal to the Commissioner. The HMO shall provide to the subscriber written notice of the right to appeal upon completion of the full grievance procedure and supply the Commissioner with a copy of the final decision letter;(8) The HMO shall have physician involvement in reviewing medically related grievances. Physician involvement in the grievance process should not be limited to the subscriber's primary care physician, but may include at least one other physician;(9) The HMO shall offer to meet with the subscriber during the formal grievance process. The location of the meeting shall be at the administrative offices of the HMO within the service area or at a location within the service area which is convenient to the subscriber;(10) The HMO may not establish time limits of less than one year from the date of occurrence for the subscriber to file a formal grievance;(11) Each HMO shall maintain an accurate record of each formal grievance. Each record shall include the following: A complete description of the grievance, the subscriber's name and address, the provider's name and address and the HMO's name and address; a complete description of the HMO's factual findings and conclusions after completion of the full formal grievance procedure; a complete description of the HMO's conclusions pertaining to the grievance as well as the HMO's final disposition of the grievance; and a statement as to which levels of the grievance procedure the grievance has been processed and how many more levels of the grievance procedure are remaining before the grievance has been processed through the HMO's entire grievance procedure.(c) Copies of the grievances and the responses to the grievances shall be available to the Commissioner and, subject to state and federal privacy laws, to the public for inspection for five years.(d) Any subscriber grievance in which time is of the essence shall be handled on an expedited basis, such that a reasonable person would believe that a prevailing subscriber would be able to realize the full benefit of a decision in his or her favor.(e) Each health maintenance organization shall submit to the Commissioner an annual report in a form prescribed by the Commissioner which describes the grievance procedure and contains a compilation and analysis of the grievances filed, their disposition, and their underlying causes.",

The controlled insurer shall suspend the authority of the controlling producer to write business during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for the termination;(2) The controlling producer shall render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges and other fees received by, or owing to, the controlling producer;(3) The controlling producer shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the controlled insurer on at least a monthly basis. The due date shall be fixed so that premiums or installments thereof collected shall be remitted no later than ninety days after the effective date of any policy placed with the controlled insurer under this contract;(4) All funds collected for the controlled insurer's account shall be held by the controlling producer in a fiduciary capacity, in one or more appropriately identified bank accounts in banks that are members of the federal reserve system, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. However, funds of a controlling producer not required to be licensed in this state shall be maintained in compliance with the requirements of the controlling producer's domiciliary jurisdiction;(5) The controlling producer shall maintain separately identifiable records of business written for the controlled insurer;(6) The contract may not be assigned in whole or in part by the controlling producer;(7) The controlled insurer shall provide the controlling producer with its underwriting standards, rules and procedures manuals setting forth the rates to be charged and the conditions for the acceptance or rejection of risks. The controlling producer shall adhere to the standards, rules, procedures, rates and conditions. The standards, rules, procedures, rates and conditions shall be the same as those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by a producer other than the controlling producer;(8) The rates and terms of the controlling producer's commissions, charges or other fees and the purposes for those charges or fees. The rates of the commissions, charges and other fees may be no greater than those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by producers other than controlling producers. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision (7) of this subsection, examples of \"comparable business\" includes the same lines of insurance, same kinds of insurance, same kinds of risks, similar policy limits and similar quality of business;(9) If the contract provides that the controlling producer, on insurance business placed with the insurer, is to be compensated contingent upon the insurer's profits on that business, then the compensation may not be determined and paid until at least five years after the premiums on liability insurance are earned and at least one year after the premiums are earned on any other insurance. In no event may the commissions be paid until the adequacy of the controlled insurer's reserves on remaining claims has been independently verified pursuant to subdivision (1), subsection (d) of this section;(10) A limit on the controlling producer's writings in relation to the controlled insurer's surplus and total writings. The insurer may establish a different limit for each line or subline of business. The controlled insurer shall notify the controlling producer when the applicable limit is approached and shall not accept business from the controlling producer if the limit is reached. The controlling producer may not place business with the controlled insurer if it has been notified by the controlled insurer that the limit has been reached; and(11) The controlling producer may negotiate but may not bind reinsurance on behalf of the controlled insurer on business the controlling producer places with the controlled insurer, except that the controlling producer may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the controlled insurer contains underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which the automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured and commission schedules.(c) Every controlled insurer shall have an audit committee of the board of directors composed of independent directors. The audit committee shall annually meet with management, the insurer's independent certified public accountants, and an independent casualty actuary or other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the commissioner to review the adequacy of the insurer's loss reserves.(d) In addition to any other required loss reserve certification, the controlled insurer shall annually, on April 1 of each year, file with the commissioner the following:(1) An opinion of an independent casualty actuary or any other independent loss reserve specialist acceptable to the commissioner, reporting loss ratios for each line of business written and attesting to the adequacy of loss reserves established for losses incurred and outstanding as of year-end, including incurred but not reported losses, on business placed by the producer; and(2) A report and summary of the amount of commissions paid to the producer, the percentage such amount represents of the net premiums written and comparable amounts and percentage paid to noncontrolling producers for placements of the same kinds of insurance.",

      "text": "Findings and purpose.(a) The Legislature finds that:(1) There has been a nationwide downturn in the coal mining industry which was especially difficult in West Virginia;(2) Coal mining permit holders across the state have faced economic circumstances that forced many of them into difficult financial situations;(3) Insolvent permit holders may be unable to continue operations, thus jeopardizing their ability to properly reclaim lands as required under §22-3-1et seq.of this code;(4) Any shortfall would be paid from the state’s Special Reclamation Fund which could become strained if the coal industry and/ or reclamation surety bond providers would experience unforeseen circumstances;(5) An increase in bonding amounts would cause undue financial hardships and coal mining permit holders in West Virginia may find it increasingly difficult to comply with the financial assurance provisions of §22-3-1et seq.of this code;(6) The difficulty or impossibility of obtaining private performance bonds on reasonable economic terms may result in challenges for operators to receive new coal-mining permits;(7) Having a robust guarantee of proper reclamation of mining operations is of utmost importance to the citizens of West Virginia;(8) A mechanism is needed for an alternative provider in the state’s current coal mining bonding system to provide for additional coverage and further bolster an efficient and effective method of complying with the reclamation requirements and the financial assurance provisions of §22-3-1et seq.of this code;(9) A state assisted mutual insurance company or a similar entity has proven to be a successful mechanism in West Virginia for helping stabilize certain insurance markets such as medical professional liability and worker compensation;(10) There is a substantial public interest in creating a method to provide an enhanced mining reclamation performance bond insurance market in this state;(11) The state currently funds reclamation at former coal-mining sites, where the bond has been forfeited, through a combination of bond proceeds and, if needed, moneys from the Special Reclamation Fund as approved by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act;(12) There is substantial public benefit in maintaining a stable self-sufficient entity which can be a source of performance bond insurance coverage for permit holders in this state;(13) A stable, financially viable insurer in the private sector will provide a continuing source of insurance funds to accomplish reclamation as needed to protect the environment of the state; and(14) Because the public will greatly benefit from the formation of a Mining Mutual Insurance Company, state efforts to encourage and support the formation of such an entity, including providing a loan of the entity’s initial capital, is in the clear public interest.(b) The purpose of this article is to create a mechanism for the formation of a mining mutual insurance company that will provide:(1) An option for mining permit holders to obtain performance bond insurance that is available and affordable; and(2) Assure that reclamation will occur in a timely and predictable fashion in those instances where a permit holder fails to perform under the terms of the permit issued pursuant to §22-3-1et seq.of this code.",
