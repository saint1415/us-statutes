Action shall be taken by a majority of the compacting states and each state shall be entitled to one vote.The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member states.It shall be the duty of each member state to formulate and put into effect a forest fire plan for that state and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.Article IVWhenever the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member state in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it shall be the duty of the state forest fire control agency of that state to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.Article VWhenever the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of such state shall, under the direction of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith: Provided, That nothing herein shall be construed as relieving any person from liability for his own negligent act or omission, or as imposing liability for such negligent act or omission upon any state.All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of, any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, subsistence of employees and maintenance of equipment incurred in connection with such request: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such service to the receiving member state without charge or cost.Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.For the purposes of this compact, the term \"employee\" shall include any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.Article VIRatification of this compact shall not be construed to affect any existing statute so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest firefighting forces, equipment services or facilities of any member state.Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or restrict the powers of any state ratifying the same to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in such prevention, control and extinguishment in such state.Nothing in this compact shall be construed to affect any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between any federal agency and a member state or states.Article VIIThe compact administrators may request the United States forest service to act as a research and coordinating agency of the southeastern interstate forest fire protection compact in cooperation with the appropriate agencies in each state, and the United States forest service may accept responsibility for preparing and presenting to the compact administrators its recommendations with respect to the regional fire plan. Representatives of any federal agency engaged in forest fire prevention and control may attend meetings of the compact administrators.Article VIIIThe provisions of articles four and five of this compact which relate to mutual aid in combatting, controlling or preventing forest fires shall be operative as between any state party to this compact and any other state which is party to a regional forest fire protection compact in another region: Provided, That the Legislature of such other state shall have given its assent to such mutual aid provisions of this compact.Article IXThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state ratifying it until the Legislature or the Governor of such state, as the laws of such state shall provide, takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until six months after notice thereof has been sent by the chief executive of the state desiring to withdraw to the chief executives of all states then parties to the compact.",

The location by these organizations of facilities within the state will contribute significantly to the economy of West Virginia, and enhance the state's reputation as a place to visit and transact business. Because it is recognized that there are inherent risks in various adventure and recreational activities which should be understood by participants therein and which are essentially impossible for the organizations and their providers to eliminate, it is the purpose of this article to define those areas of responsibility and those affirmative acts for which these nonprofit organizations and their providers of adventure and recreational activities shall be liable for loss, damage or injury suffered by participants, and to further define those risks which the participants expressly assume and for which there can be no recovery.",

If the retiring member is married, the spouse shall sign a waiver of benefit rights if the beneficiary is to be other than the spouse.(2)Ten Years Certain and Life Annuity. — A life annuity payable during the retirant’s lifetime but in any event for a minimum of 10 years.

For this calculation, the primary insurance amount is estimated when the member applies for retirement, using Social Security law then in effect, using assumptions established by the board.(b) If a retirant who has elected the options set forth in subdivision (1), subsection (a) of this section, whose beneficiary dies prior to the retirant’s death, the retirant may name an alternative beneficiary. If an alternative beneficiary is named within 18 months following the death of the prior beneficiary, the benefit shall be adjusted to be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit the retirant is receiving just after the death of the retirant’s named beneficiary. If the election is not made until 18 months after the death of the prior beneficiary, the amount shall be reduced so that it is only 90 percent of the actuarial equivalent of the benefit the retirant is receiving just after the death of the retirant’s named beneficiary.(c) (1) If a retirant who has elected an option set forth in subdivision (1), subsection (a) of this section, designated his or her spouse as beneficiary, upon divorce or annulment, the retirant may elect to change the retirement benefit options offered by those subdivisions to a life annuity in an amount adjusted on a fair basis to be of equal actuarial value of the annuity prospectively in effect relative to the retirant at the time the option is elected:Provided, That the retirant furnishes to the board satisfactory proof of entry of a final decree of divorce or annulment:Provided, however,That the retirant certifies under penalty of perjury that no qualified domestic relations order, final decree of divorce or other court order that would restrict the election is in effect:Provided further, That no cause of action against the board arises or may be maintained on the basis of having permitted the retirant to change the retirement benefit option pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.(2) Upon remarriage, a retirant may name the new spouse as an annuitant for any of the retirement benefit options offered by subdivision (1), subsection (a) of this section:Provided, That the retirant shall furnish to the board proof of marriage:Provided, however, That the retirant certifies under penalty of perjury that no qualified domestic relations order, final decree of divorce or other court order that would restrict the designation is in effect:Provided further, That no cause of action against the board arises or may be maintained on the basis of having permitted the retirant to name a new spouse as annuitant for any of the survivorship retirement benefit options.

The membership of any person in the plan ceases: (1) Upon the withdrawal of accumulated contributions after the cessation of service; (2) upon retirement; or (3) at death.(b) Any Natural Resources Police Officer employed in covered employment on July 1, 2020, shall notify in writing both the Division of Natural Resources and the board no later than September 30, 2020, of his or her desire to become a member of the plan beginning January 2, 2021:Provided, That any Natural Resources Police Officer hired after July 1, 2020, but before January 2, 2021, shall make this required notification to the division and the board no later than 30 days from receipt of the notice required by §20-18-11 of this code or September 30, 2020, whichever is later. Any Natural Resources Police Officer who elects to become a member of the plan ceases to be an active member in the Public Employees Retirement System and shall continue to be ineligible for future membership in any other retirement system administered by the board so long as the Natural Resources Police Officer remains employed in covered employment in this plan; any Natural Resources Police Officer who does not affirmatively elect to become a member of the plan continues to be eligible for any other retirement system as is from time to time offered to other state employees but is ineligible for this plan regardless of any subsequent termination of employment and rehire.(c) Any Natural Resources Police Officer employed in covered employment on the effective date of this article, who has timely elected to transfer into this plan as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be given credited service at the time of transfer for all credited service then standing to the Natural Resources Police Officer service credit in the Public Employees Retirement System regardless of whether the credited service (as that term is defined in §5-10-2 of this code) was earned as a Natural Resources Police Officer. All the credited service standing to the transferring Natural Resources Police Officer’s credit in the Public Employees Retirement Fund System at the time of transfer into this plan shall be transferred into the plan created by this article, and the transferring Natural Resources Police Officer shall be given the same credit for the purposes of this article for all service transferred from the Public Employees Retirement System, as that transferring Natural Resources Police Officer would have received from the Public Employees Retirement System as if the transfer had not occurred. In connection with each transferring Natural Resources Police Officer receiving credit for prior employment as provided in this subsection, a transfer from the Public Employees Retirement System to this plan shall be made pursuant to the procedures described in §20-18-10 of this code:Provided, That a member of this plan who has elected to transfer from the Public Employees Retirement System into this plan pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may not, after having transferred into and become an active member of this plan, reinstate to his or her credit in this plan any service credit relating to periods of non-Natural Resources Police Officer service which were withdrawn from the Public Employees Retirement System prior to his or her elective transfer into this plan.(d) Any Natural Resources Police Officer who was employed as a Natural Resources Police Officer between the effective date of this article and June 30, 2026, who has not commenced retirement under the Public Employees Retirement System, shall become a member upon rehire as a Natural Resources Police Officer. For purposes of this subsection, the member’s years of service and credited service prior to the effective date shall not be counted for any purposes under this plan unless the Natural Resources Police Officer has not received the return of his or her accumulated contributions in the Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to §5-10-30 of this code. The member may request in writing within two years of first becoming a member of the plan to have his or her accumulated contributions and employer contributions from all credited service, as that term is defined in §5-10-2 of this code, in the Public Employees Retirement System transferred to the plan regardless of whether the credited service was earned as a Natural Resources Police Officer. If the conditions of the subsection are met, all years of the Natural Resources Police Officer’s credited service shall be counted as years of service for the purposes of this article.(e) Any certified law enforcement officer who has law enforcement service with a participating public employer in the Public Employees Retirement System who is first employed in covered employment between the effective date of this article and June 30, 2026, and who has not commenced retirement under the Public Employees Retirement System, shall be a member of this retirement system. For purposes of this subsection, the member’s years of service and credited service prior to the effective date shall not be counted for any purposes under this plan unless the Natural Resources Police Officer has not received the return of his or her accumulated contributions in the Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to §5-10-30 of this code. The member may request in writing within two years of first becoming a member of the plan to have up to a maximum of three years of his or her accumulated contributions and employer contributions from credited service, as that term is defined in §5-10-2 of this code, earned while performing service as a certified law enforcement officer in the Public Employees Retirement System transferred to the plan. If the member has more than three years of credited service as a certified law enforcement officer in the Public Employees Retirement System, the accumulated contributions and employer contributions of the first thirty-six months of credited service with full salary as a certified law enforcement officer shall be transferred. If the conditions of the subsection are met, the maximum three years of credited service in the Public Employees Retirement System as a certified law enforcement officer shall be counted as years of service for the purposes of this article.(f) Any Natural Resources Police Officer who was employed as a Natural Resources Police Officer prior to the effective date of this article and who was rehired as a Natural Resource Police Officer on or after July 1, 2026, and who has not commenced retirement under the Public Employees Retirement System, shall become a member upon rehire as a Natural Resources Police Officer. For purposes of this subsection, the member’s years of service and credited service prior to the effective date shall not be counted for any purposes under this plan unless the Natural Resources Police Officer has not received the return of his or her accumulated contributions in the Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to §5-10-30 of this code. The member may request in writing within one year of first becoming a member of the plan to have his or her accumulated contributions and employer contributions from covered employment in the Public Employees Retirement System transferred to the plan. If the conditions of the subsection are met, all years of the Natural Resources Police Officer’s covered employment shall be counted as years of service for the purposes of this article.(g) Once made, the election provided in this section is irrevocable. All Natural Resources Police Officers first employed after the effective date and Natural Resources Police Officers electing to become members as described in this section shall be members as a condition of employment and shall make the contributions required by §20-18-8 of this code.(h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article to the contrary, any individual who is a leased employee is not eligible to participate in the plan. For purposes of this plan, a \"leased employee\" means any individual who performs services as an independent contractor or pursuant to an agreement with an employee leasing organization or similar organization.
