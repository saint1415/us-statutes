      "text": "Third Grade Success Act; multi-tiered system of support for early literacy and numeracy in kindergarten through grade three; pre-service and in-service teacher training; notice to parent or guardian; third grade retention policy with exceptions; interventions continuing in fourth grade for students below proficient.(a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Third Grade Success Act.(b) The Legislature finds that:(1) In the early learning years, ensuring that each student masters the content and skills needed for mastery at the next grade level is critically important for student success;(2) Students who do not demonstrate grade-level proficiency in reading and mathematics by the end of third grade become increasingly less likely to succeed at each successive grade level and often drop out of school prior to graduation;(3) State board policy requires every school to establish a process for ensuring the developmental and academic progress of all students. This process is to be coordinated by a school student assistance team that reviews student developmental and academic needs that have persisted despite being addressed through instruction, multi-tiered system of support for intervention, and as applicable, supports for personalized learning. Ensuring the developmental and academic success of all students requires every school to implement, in an equitable manner, programs during and after the instructional day at the appropriate instructional levels that contribute to the success of students; and(4) To ensure that all students read and perform mathematics proficiently by the end of third grade, a statewide comprehensive approach to early literacy and numeracy is required. This approach shall focus on intensive supports during the early learning years which include schools and engaged communities mobilized to remove barriers, expand opportunities, and assist parents in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities to serve as full partners in the success of their children.(c) “Science of reading” means evidence-based reading instruction practices that address the acquisition of language, phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics and spelling, fluency, vocabulary, oral language, comprehension, and writing that can be differentiated to meet the needs of individual students.(d) The state board shall, in accordance with §29A-3B-1et seq. of this code, promulgate legislative rules as necessary to effectuate the provisions of this section. The rules shall provide for at least the following:(1) Development of a statewide comprehensive, systemic approach to close the reading and mathematics achievement gaps by third grade, which targets school readiness, the attendance gap, science of reading instruction (phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and writing), summer learning loss, the use of screeners and/or benchmark assessments in English language arts and mathematics for students in grades kindergarten through three, and a multi-tiered system of support for students exhibiting a substantial reading or mathematics deficiency;(2) Ensuring all West Virginia children have access to high-quality early learning experiences that focus on healthy learners as part of the school readiness model, resulting in increased populations of children on target for healthy development prior to entering first grade;(3) Closing the attendance gap to certify West Virginia children attend school regularly and limit chronic absenteeism in the early grades;(4) Providing assistance to county boards with the training and implementation of the science of reading training for all kindergarten through grade three educators, early childhood classroom assistant teachers, aides, paraprofessionals and any interventionists that a county board may choose to employ instead of an early childhood classroom assistant teacher, aides, or paraprofessionals pursuant to §18-5-18a(b) of this code;(5) Assisting county boards in establishing and operating targeted, sustained extended day and extended year reading and mathematics programs to ensure grade level proficiency and battle summer learning loss;(6) Establishing an approved list of screeners and/or benchmark assessments in English language arts and mathematics for students in grades kindergarten through three for the purpose of identifying students with a significant reading and/or mathematics deficiency. The screener and/or benchmark assessments shall be given in the first 30 days of the school year and repeated at mid-year and at the end of the school year to determine student progression in reading and mathematics in kindergarten through third grade;(7) Establishing an approved list of dyslexia screeners to be administered to students no less than twice per year in kindergarten through third grade and any time students with identified deficiencies are not responding to interventions;(8) Any student in kindergarten or grades one through three who exhibits a deficiency in reading at any time, based upon the screeners and/or benchmark assessments, and/or the comprehensive statewide student assessment, and any fourth-grade student promoted for good cause shall receive an individual reading improvement plan no later than 30 days after the identification of the reading deficiency. The reading improvement plan shall be created by the teacher, principal, other pertinent school personnel, and the parent(s) or guardians, and shall describe the research-based reading intervention services the student will receive to remedy the reading deficit. Each student shall receive intensive reading intervention until the student no longer has a deficiency in reading. Reading interventions may include evidence-based strategies frequently used to remediate reading deficiencies and includes, but is not limited to, individual instruction, small-group instruction, tutoring, mentoring, or the use of technology that targets specific reading skills and abilities;(9) Maximizing family engagement to result in the development of a culture of literacy and numeracy, which shall at least include:(A) Providing parents or guardians with regular updates to inform them of their child’s progress toward proficiency in reading and mathematics;(B) Ensuring parents or guardians are informed of and have access to resources which they may utilize to improve their child’s literacy and numeracy skills;(C) Ensuring the parent or guardian is informed of the importance of their child being able to demonstrate grade level reading and mathematics skills by the end of the third grade and the measures that will be employed pursuant to this section to improve the reading and mathematics skills of children who are not meeting the standards; and(D) The parent or guardian of any student in kindergarten through grade three who exhibits a deficiency in reading or mathematics at any time during the school year must be notified in writing no later than 15 days after the identification of the deficiency, and the written notification must include the following:(i) That the student has been identified as having a deficiency in reading and/or mathematics;(ii) A description of the proposed research-based reading and/or mathematics interventions and/or supplemental instructional services and supports that will be provided to the child to address the identified area(s) of deficiency;(iii) Strategies for the parent or guardian to use at home to help their child succeed in reading and/or mathematics; and(iv) That if the child’s reading or mathematics deficiency is not corrected by the end of grade three, the child may not be promoted to grade four unless an exemption is met;(10) Supporting high-quality schools and a workforce prepared to address early literacy and numeracy by the provision of professional development for administrators, kindergarten, first, second, and third grade teachers including, but not limited to, the following:(A) The approved benchmark assessment and/or screener tools to ensure teachers have the knowledge and skill to administer the assessment and/or screener, analyze the data to inform instruction, and identify students exhibiting substantial deficiencies in reading or mathematics;(B) Comprehensive training on the science of reading and numeracy instruction to ensure all kindergarten through grade three teachers, early childhood classroom assistant teachers, aides and paraprofessionals, have the knowledge and skill to teach and/or support all students to read and perform mathematics at grade level. The rules also shall provide that any interventionist a county chooses to employ instead of an early childhood classroom assistant teacher, aides or paraprofessionals pursuant to §18-5-18a(b) receives this comprehensive training;(C) Training and materials to inform classroom teachers of the characteristics of dyslexia and dyscalculia in students, components of benchmarks and screeners that may indicate dyslexia or dyscalculia, and strategies for instruction; and(D) Job-embedded, on-site teacher training on evidence-based reading and mathematics instruction and data-driven decision-making that provides kindergarten through grade three teachers with immediate feedback for improving instruction;(11) Ensuring the employment of qualified teachers and service personnel in accordance with §18-5-39 and §18A-4-7c of this code to provide instruction to students enrolled in early literacy and numeracy support programs including, but not limited to, ensuring that educator preparation programs prepare candidates seeking licensure for elementary education with training and instruction to:(A) Include instruction in state-adopted grade-level content standards, foundational reading and mathematics skills, and how to implement reading instruction using high-quality instructional materials;(B) Provide effective instruction and intervention for students with reading and math deficiencies, including students with characteristics of dyslexia or dyscalculia; and(C) Understand and use student data to make instructional decisions;(12) Creating a formula or grant-based program for the distribution of funds appropriated specifically for the purposes of this section or otherwise available for the support of a targeted, multi-tiered system of support intervention for early literacy and numeracy;(13) Providing support for transportation and healthy foods for students required to attend after-school and extended year early literacy and numeracy instructional support programs and supervision at the school that accommodates the typical work schedules of parents; and(14) Receiving from county boards any applications and annual reports required by rule of the state board.(e) A student in grades kindergarten through grade three shall be required to attend an extended year early literacy and numeracy instructional support program as a condition for promotion if:(1) The student has been provided additional academic assistance through interventions offered during the school day or after-school in early literacy and numeracy and, prior to the end of the school year, the student assistance team or the student’s classroom teacher recommends that further additional academic help is needed for the student to be successful at the next grade level; and(2) The county board has established a literacy and numeracy instructional support program during the extended year for the student’s grade level.(f) County boards shall provide high-quality educational facilities, equipment, and services to support literacy and numeracy instructional support programs established pursuant to this section. Extended year programs may be provided at a central location for kindergarten through third graders who qualify for the program.(g) Each county board shall adopt high-quality instructional materials grounded in scientifically-based reading research and aligned to state standards to be used as the core curriculum. The instructional materials shall not include practices that are aligned with the Three-Cueing Systems Model of teaching reading.(h) This section may not be construed to prohibit a classroom teacher from recommending the grade level retention of a student in any of the grades kindergarten through grade three based upon the student’s lack of mastery of the subject matter and preparation for the subject matter at the next grade level. Benchmark and/or screener data shall be used to inform the classroom teacher’s recommendation.(i) This section may not be construed to affect the individualized education plans of exceptional students.(j) This section may not be construed to limit the authority of the county board to establish an extended year program in accordance with §18-5-39 of this code. County boards may not charge tuition for enrollment in early literacy and numeracy instructional support programs established pursuant to this section.(k) Each county board shall implement the provisions of this section and the provisions of the state board rule required by subsection (b) of this section. The county board shall establish a process for ensuring the developmental and academic progress of all students through the auspices of student assistance teams as currently required by state board policy and perform a needs assessment to determine the potential capacity requirements for the multi-tiered system of support for early learners. Each county board also shall provide in-service training:(1) For kindergarten through grade three early childhood classroom assistant teachers, aides and paraprofessionals, specifically related to literacy, numeracy, and their responsibilities and appropriate measures for exercising authority and control over students. The county board shall also provide this training to any interventionists it chooses to employ instead of an early childhood classroom assistant teacher, aide or professional pursuant to §18-5-18a(b) of this code; and(2) For classroom teachers in grades kindergarten through three to help the classroom teachers gain a strong understanding of how to best utilize the early childhood classroom assistant teachers, aides, paraprofessionals or interventionists during classroom instruction and during other periods of the day.(l) The state board shall provide a report describing the proposed implementation of the multi-tiered system of support for early literacy and numeracy to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability on or before July 1, 2023.(m) The state board shall provide a comprehensive report regarding the status of the multi-tiered system of support for literacy and numeracy to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability, the Joint Committee on Government and Finance, and the Governor on or before November 1, 2023, and annually on or before November 1 of each year thereafter. The report shall address, at a minimum, the progress of the program throughout the state, its effect on student achievement, and the sources of the funding both available to and used by the program.(n) Legislative appropriations to the State Board of Education – State Department of Education Elementary Literacy and Numeracy Program shall be used for the implementation of the provisions of this section along with other funds available for providing a high-quality education.(o) Effective for the school year beginning July 1, 2026, and thereafter, a public school student who generally demonstrates a minimal understanding of, and ability to apply, grade level English language arts or mathematics knowledge, skills, and abilities, or both, as indicated on the West Virginia General Summative Assessment relative to the West Virginia College and Career Readiness Standards at the end of third grade, shall upon the recommendation of the teacher and the student assistance team, be retained in the third grade for the ensuing school year subject to the following exceptions:(1) A student with disabilities whose Individual Education Plan indicates participation in the statewide alternate summative assessment;(2) A student identified as an English language learner who has had less than three years instruction in English as a second language;(3) A student with disabilities who participates in the statewide summative assessment, has an Individual Education Plan or Section 504 plan that reflects that the student has received intensive intervention for more than two years and still demonstrates a deficiency or who was previously retained in any of the grades kindergarten through grade three;(4) A student who is in the process of a special education referral or evaluation for placement in special education, has been diagnosed as having a significant impairment, including dyslexia or dyscalculia, or is a child with a disability if the student’s individualized education program team and the student’s parent or guardian agree that promotion is appropriate based on the student’s Individualized Education Plan;(5) A student who has received intensive intervention for two or more years, still demonstrates a deficiency, and who was previously retained in any of the grades kindergarten through grade three for a total of two years:Provided, That the student shall continue to receive intensive intervention in grade four;(6) A student who demonstrates an acceptable level of performance on an alternative standardized assessment approved by the state board;(7) A student who attends an extended year learning program following the third grade and has attained proficiency; and(8) A student whose parent or guardian has requested a good cause exemption within the time period established by the county board and the superintendent, or his or her designee, determines that the good cause exemption is in the best interests of the child:Provided, That a good cause exemption may not prohibit the grade level retention of a student by a classroom teacher based upon the student’s lack of mastery of the subject matter and preparation for the subject matter at the next grade level.",

This subsection applies to any member who first became an employee of a participating public employer on or after July 1, 2015, and also applies to any member who became an employee of a participating public employer before July 1, 2015, and is unable to meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.(1) Any member may purchase up to 60 months of military service credit for time served in active military duty prior to first becoming an employee of a participating public employer if all of the following conditions are met:(A) The member has completed a complete fiscal year of contributory service;(B) The active military duty occurs prior to the date on which the member first becomes an employee of a participating public employer; and(C) The employee pays to the retirement system the actuarial reserve purchase amount within 48 months after the date on which employer and employee contributions are first received by the retirement system for the member and while he or she continues to be in the employ of a participating public employer and contributing to the retirement system, or within 48 months of July 1, 2015, whichever is later:Provided, That any employee who ceases employment with a participating public employer before completing the required actuarial reserve purchase amount in full shall not be eligible to purchase the military service.(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (A), subdivision (1) of this subsection, a member who first becomes an employee of a participating public employer on or after July 1, 2015, but who does not remain employed and contributing to the retirement system for at least a complete fiscal year after his or her initial employment, shall be considered to have met the requirement of said paragraph the first time he or she becomes an employee of a participating public employer and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributing service. Such a member shall be considered to have met the requirement of paragraph (C) of said subdivision if he or she pays to the retirement system the actuarial reserve purchase amount within 48 months after the date on which employer and employee contributions are first received by the retirement system for the member the first time he or she becomes an employee of a participating public employer and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributing service, and while he or she continues to be in the employ of a participating public employer and contributing to the retirement system.(3) A member who first becomes an employee of a participating public employer on or after July 1, 2015, may purchase military service credit for active military duty performed on or after the date he or she first becomes an employee of a participating public employer only if all of the following conditions are met:Provided, That the maximum military service credit such member may purchase shall take into account any military service credit purchased for active military duty pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection in addition to any military service credit purchased pursuant to this subdivision:(A) The member was an employee of a participating public employer, terminated employment and experienced a break in contributing service in the retirement system of one or more months, performed active military service while not an employee of the participating public employer and not contributing to the retirement system, then again becomes an employee of a participating public employer and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributory service;(B) The member does not qualify for military service credit for such active military duty pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; and(C) The member pays to the retirement system the actuarial reserve purchase amount within 48 months after the date on which employer and employee contributions are first received by the retirement system for the member after he or she again becomes an employee of a participating public employer immediately following the period of active military duty and break in service and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributory service, and while he or she continues to be in the employ of a participating public employer and contributing to the retirement system.(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (A), subdivision (3) of this subsection, a member who otherwise meets the requirements of said paragraph, but who does not remain employed and contributing to the retirement system for at least a complete fiscal year when he or she first becomes an employee of a participating public employer after the period of active military duty and break in service, shall be considered to have met the requirement of said paragraph the first time he or she again becomes an employee of a participating public employer and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributing service. Such a member shall be considered to have met the requirement of paragraph (C) of said subdivision if he or she pays to the retirement system the actuarial reserve purchase amount within 48 months after the date on which employer and employee contributions are first received by the retirement system for the member for the first time he or she again becomes an employee of a participating public employer and completes at least a complete fiscal year of contributing service, and while he or she continues to be in the employ of a participating public employer and contributing to the retirement system.(5) For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:(A) \"Active military duty\" means full-time active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States for a period of 30 or more consecutive calendar days. Active military duty does not include inactive duty of any kind.(B) \"Actuarial reserve purchase amount\" means the purchase annuity rate multiplied by the purchase accrued benefit, calculated as of the calculation month, plus annual interest accruing at 7.5 percent from the calculation month through the purchase month, compounded monthly.(C) \"Armed forces of the United States\" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and Coast Guard, the reserve components thereof, and the National Guard of the United States or the National Guard of a state or territory when members of the same are on full-time active duty pursuant to Title 10 or Title 32 of the United States Code.(D) \"Calculation month\" means the month immediately following the month in which the member completes a complete fiscal year of contributory service with a participating public employer required by subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection, as applicable.(E) \"Purchase accrued benefit\" means two percent times the purchase military service times the purchase average monthly salary.(F) \"Purchase age\" means the age of the employee in years and completed months as of the first day of the calculation month.(G) \"Purchase annuity rate\" means the actuarial lump sum annuity factor calculated as of the calculation month based on the following actuarial assumptions: Interest rate of 7.5 percent; mortality of the 1971 group annuity mortality table, 50 percent blended male and female rates, applied on a unisex basis to all members; if purchase age is under age 62, a deferred annuity factor with payments commencing at age 62; and if purchase age is 62 or over, an immediate annuity factor with payments starting at the purchase age.(H) \"Purchase average monthly salary\" means the average monthly salary of the member during the number of months of the member’s contract during the fiscal year of contributory service required by subdivisions (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection, as applicable. For any member who first became an employee of a participating public employer before July 1, 2015, the purchase average monthly salary means the average monthly salary of the member during the number of months of the member’s contract during his or her complete fiscal year of contributory service on or after July 1, 2015.(I) \"Purchase military service\" means the amount of military service being purchased by the employee in months up to the 60-month maximum, calculated in accordance with subdivision (7) of this subsection.(J) \"Purchase month\" means the month in which the employee deposits the actuarial reserve lump sum purchase amount into the plan trust fund in full payment of the service credit being purchased or makes the final payment of the actuarial reserve purchase amount into the plan trust fund in full payment of the service credit being purchased.(6) A member may purchase military service credit for a period of active military duty pursuant to this subsection only if the member received an honorable discharge for the period. Anything other than an honorable discharge, including, but not limited to, a general or under honorable conditions discharge, an entry-level separation discharge, an other than honorable conditions discharge or a dishonorable discharge, shall disqualify the member from receiving military service credit for the period of service. The board shall require a member requesting military service credit to provide official documentation establishing that the requirements set forth in this subsection have been met.(7) To calculate the amount of military service credit a member may purchase, the board shall add the total number of days in each period of a member’s active military duty eligible to be purchased, divide the total by 30, and round up or down to the nearest integer (fractions of 0.5 shall be rounded up), in order to yield the total number of months of military service credit a member may purchase, subject to the 60-month maximum. A member may purchase all or part of the maximum amount of military service credit he or she is eligible for in one-month increments.(8) To receive credit, a member must submit a request to purchase military service credit to the board, on such form or in such other manner as shall be required by the board, within the complete fiscal year period required by subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection, as applicable. The board shall then calculate the actuarial reserve lump sum purchase amount, which amount must be paid by the member within the 48-month period required by said subdivisions, as applicable. A member purchasing military service credit pursuant to this subsection must do so in a single, lump sum payment:Provided, That the board may accept partial, installment or other similar payments if the employee executes a contract with the board specifying the amount of military service to be purchased and the payments required:Provided, however, That any failure to pay the contract amount in accordance with this section shall be treated as an overpayment or excess contribution subject to §18-7A-14c of this code and no military service shall be credited.(9) The board shall require a member requesting military service credit to provide official documentation establishing that the requirements set forth in this subsection have been met.(10) Military service credit purchased pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered contributing service credit or contributory service for purposes of this article.(11) If a member who has purchased military service credit pursuant to this subsection is eligible for and requests a withdrawal of accumulated contributions pursuant to the provisions of this article, he or she shall also receive a refund of the actuarial reserve purchase amount he or she paid to the retirement system to purchase military service credit, together with regular interest on such amount.(c) No period of military service shall be used to obtain credit in more than one retirement system administered by the board and once used in any system, a period of military service may not be used again in any other system.(d) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time. For purposes of this section, \"qualified military service\" has the same meaning as in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code.(e) In any case of doubt as to the period of service to be credited a member under the provisions of this section, the board has final power to determine the period. The board is authorized to determine all questions and make all decisions relating to this section and, pursuant to the authority granted to the board in §18-10D-1 of this code, may propose rules to administer this section for legislative approval in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1et seq. of this code.",

If repayable in installments, the interest shall not exceed the annual rate so established upon the principal amount of the loan, for the entire period of the loan, and the charge shall be added to the principal amount of the loan. The minimal interest charge shall be for six months.(3) No member is eligible for more than one outstanding loan at any time: Provided, That the foregoing provision does not apply to any loan made pursuant to article seven-d of this chapter. Upon full payment of a loan, a member may apply for a subsequent loan after sixty days beginning the first day of the month following receipt of final payment.(4) If a refund of accumulated contributions is payable to the borrower or his or her beneficiary before he or she repays the loan with interest, the balance due with interest to date shall be deducted from the refund. A member with an unpaid loan balance who wishes to retire or becomes eligible to receive disability benefits under any provision of this article may have the loan repaid in full by accepting retirement income or disability payments reduced by deducting from the actuarial reserve for the accrued benefit the amount of the unpaid balance plus accrued interest, if any, and then converting the remaining of the reserve to a monthly pension or disability benefit payable in the form of the annuity desired by the member.(5) From his or her monthly salary as a teacher or a nonteacher the member shall pay the loan and interest by deductions which will pay the loan and interest in substantially level payments in not more than sixty nor less than six months. Upon notice of loan granted and payment due, the employer is responsible for making the salary deductions and reporting them to the retirement board. At the option of the board, loan deductions may be collected as prescribed herein for the collection of members' contribution, or may be collected through issuance of warrant by employer. If the borrower is no longer employed as a teacher or nonteaching member, the borrower must make monthly loan payments directly to the Consolidated Public Retirement Board and the board must accept the payments.(6) The entire unpaid balance of any loan, and interest due thereon, shall, at the option of the board, become due and payable without further notice or demand upon the occurrence with respect to the borrowing member of any of the following events of default: (A) Any payment of principal and accrued interest on a loan remains unpaid after it becomes due and payable under the terms of the loan or after the grace period established in the discretion of the board; (B) the borrowing member attempts to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors of his or her refund or benefit under the retirement system; or (C) any other event of default set forth in rules promulgated by the board in accordance with the authority granted pursuant to section one, article ten-d, chapter five of this code: Provided, That any refund or offset of an unpaid loan balance shall be made only at the time the member is entitled to receive a distribution under the retirement system.(7) Loans shall be evidenced by such form of obligations and shall be made upon such additional terms as to default, prepayment, security, and otherwise as the board determines.(8) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the loan program authorized by this section shall comply with the provisions of Section 72(p)(2) and Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the federal regulations issued thereunder, and accordingly, the retirement board is authorized to: (A) Apply and construe the provisions of this section and administer the plan loan program in such a manner as to comply with the provisions of Section 72(p)(2) and Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code and the federal regulations issued thereunder; (B) adopt plan loan policies or procedures consistent with these federal law provisions; and (C) take such actions as it considers necessary or appropriate to administer the plan loan program created hereunder in accordance with these federal law provisions. The retirement board is further authorized in connection with the plan loan program to take any actions that may at any time be required by the Internal Revenue Service regarding compliance with the requirements of Section 72(p)(2) or Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the federal regulations issued thereunder, notwithstanding any provision in this article to the contrary.(b) Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the loan program authorized by this section shall not be available to any teacher or nonteacher who becomes a member of the Teachers Retirement System on or after July 1, 2005: Provided, That a member is eligible for a loan under article seven-d of this chapter to pay all or part of the Actuarial Reserve, or if available in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d), section six, article seven-d of this chapter, the one and one-half percent contribution for service in the Teachers' Defined Contribution System for the purpose of receiving additional service credit in the state Teachers Retirement System pursuant to section six, article seven-d, of this chapter.(c) A member who ceases service with an unpaid loan balance will no longer be a member when the unpaid loan balance, plus accrued interest, equals or exceeds the member's accumulated contributions.",

All amounts deposited in the fund shall be pledged, as designated by the authority, to the repayment of the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on revenue bonds or refunding revenue bonds authorized by §18-9D-4b of this code.

These funds shall be transferred to the School Construction Fund and used for purposes set out within subsection (e) of this section.(g) The Legislature finds and declares that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has held that the issuance of additional revenue bonds authorized under the School Building Authority Act, as enacted in this article prior to July 20, 1993, constituted an indebtedness of the state in violation of section four, article X of the Constitution of West Virginia, but that revenue bonds issued under this article prior to July 20, 1993, are not invalid.The Legislature further finds and declares that the financial capacity of a county to construct, lease and improve school facilities depends upon the county’s bonding capacity (local property wealth), voter willingness to pass bond issues and the county’s ability to reallocate other available county funds instead of criteria related to educational needs or upon the ability of the School Building Authority created in this article to issue bonds that comply with the holding of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals or otherwise assist counties with the financing of facilities construction and improvement. The Legislature further finds and declares that this section, as well as §29-22-18 of this code, had been reenacted during the first extraordinary session of the West Virginia Legislature in the year 1994 in an attempt to comply with the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to dedicate a source of state revenues to special revenue funds for the purposes of paying the debt service on bonds and refunding bonds issued subsequent to January 1, 1994, the proceeds of which will be used for the construction and improvement of school building facilities. The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §11-15-30 of this code and §29-22-18 of this code, to appropriate revenues to two special revenue funds for the purposes of construction and improvement of school building facilities. Furthermore, the Legislature intends to encourage county boards to maintain existing levels of county funding for construction, improvement, and maintenance of school building facilities and to generate additional county funds for those purposes through bonds and special levies whenever possible. The Legislature further encourages the School Building Authority, the state board and county boards of education to propose uniform project specifications for comparable projects whenever possible to meet county needs at the lowest possible cost.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to comply with the provisions of sections four and six, article X of the Constitution of West Virginia; and section one, article XII of said Constitution.",

In order to address the intent of the Legislature contained in this subsection, the authority shall grant preference to those projects which involve multicounty arrangements as the authority shall determine reasonable and proper.(m) County boards shall submit all designs for construction of new school buildings to the School Building Authority for review and approval prior to preparation of final bid documents.

Any funding shall be on a reserve basis and converted to a part of the construction grant only after all project budget funds have been secured and all county commitments have been fulfilled. Failure of the county to solidify the project budget and meet its obligations to the state within 18 months of the date the funding is set aside by the authority will result in expiration of the reserve and the funds shall be reallocated by the authority in the succeeding funding cycle.(o) Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code §18-9D-15 or §18-9D-16, a public charter school may, in its name and sole discretion, submit application to the School Building Authority for funding for costs associated with the renovating, remodeling, purchase or construction of a building to be used for public charter school purposes and for the cost of the project, and the authority may, in its sole discretion, approve such amount of funding as it determines appropriate, in its sole discretion, for such project from monies appropriated to the authority for the benefit of public charter schools. In the event that a public charter school closes, and the public charter school used School Building Authority funding for its building, the building shall be returned to the authorizer, as defined in §18-5G-2 of this code, for purposes of ownership. If the building cannot be returned to the authorizer, the building shall be returned to the state. Additionally, if School Building Authority funds were used to improve an existing property, the School Building Authority is authorized to develop a formula to determine the monetary amount of improvements to be returned to either the authorizer or the state.",

The Southern Regional Education CompactWhereas, The states who are parties hereto have during the past several years conducted careful investigation looking toward the establishment and maintenance of jointly owned and operated regional educational institutions in the southern states in the professional, technological, scientific, literary and other fields, so as to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens of the several states who reside within such region; andWhereas, Meharry Medical College of Nashville, Tennessee, has proposed that its lands, buildings, equipment, and the net income from its endowment, be turned over to the southern states, or to an agency acting in their behalf, to be operated as a regional institution for medical, dental and nursing education upon terms and conditions to be hereafter agreed upon between the southern states and Meharry Medical College, which proposal, because of the present financial condition of the institution, has been approved by the said states who are parties hereto; andWhereas, The said states desire to enter into a compact with each other providing for the planning and establishment of regional educational facilities; now, therefore,In consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and obligations assumed by the respective states who are parties hereto (hereinafter referred to as \"states\"), the said several states do hereby form a geographical district or region consisting of the areas lying within the boundaries of the contracting states which, for the purposes of this compact, shall constitute an area for regional education supported by public funds derived from taxation by the constituent states and derived from other sources for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of regional educational schools and institutions for the benefit of citizens of the respective states residing within the region so established as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of this compact.The states do further hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the \"Board of Control for Southern Regional Education\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"board\"), the members of which board shall consist of the Governor of each state, ex officio, and four additional citizens of each state to be appointed by the Governor thereof, with the advice and consent of the Senate, at least one of whom shall be selected from the field of education, and at least one of whom shall be a member of the Legislature of that state. The Governor shall continue as a member of the board during his tenure of office as Governor of the state; but the members of the board appointed by the Governor shall hold office for a period of four years, except that in the original appointments one board member so appointed by the Governor shall be designated at the time of his appointment to serve an initial term of two years, one board member to serve an initial term of three years, and the remaining board members to serve the full term of four years, but thereafter the successor of each appointed board member shall serve the full term of four years. Vacancies on the board caused by death, resignation, refusal or inability to serve, shall be filled by appointment by the Governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The officers of the board shall be a chairman, a vice chairman, a secretary, a treasurer, and such additional officers as may be created by the board from time to time. The board shall meet annually and officers shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. The board shall have the right to formulate and establish bylaws not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact to govern its own actions in the performance of the duties delegated to it, including the right to create and appoint an executive committee and a finance committee with such powers and authority as the board may delegate to them from time to time. The board may, within its discretion, elect as its chairman, a person who is not a member of the board, provided such person resides within a signatory state; and upon such election, such person shall become a member of the board with all the rights and privileges of such membership.It shall be the duty of the board to submit plans and recommendations to the states from time to time for their approval and adoption by appropriate legislative action for the development, establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of educational schools and institutions within the geographical limits of the regional area of the states, of such character and type and for such educational purposes, professional, technological, scientific, literary, or otherwise, as they may deem and determine to be proper, necessary or advisable. Title to all such educational institutions when so established by appropriate legislative actions of the states and to all properties and facilities used in connection therewith shall be vested in said board as the agency of and for the use and benefit of the said states and the citizens thereof; and all such educational institutions shall be operated, maintained and financed in the manner herein set out, subject to any provisions or limitations which may be contained in the legislative acts of the states authorizing the creation, establishment and operation of such educational institutions.In addition to the power and authority heretofore granted, the board shall have the power to enter into such agreements or arrangements with any of the states and with educational institutions or agencies, as may be required in the judgment of the board, to provide adequate services and facilities for the graduate, professional, and technical education for the benefit of the citizens of the respective states residing within the region, and such additional and general power and authority as may be vested in the board from time to time by legislative enactment of the said states.Any two or more states who are parties of this compact shall have the right to enter into supplemental agreements providing for the establishment, financing and operation of regional educational institutions for the benefit of citizens residing within an area which constitutes a portion of the general region herein created, such institutions to be financed exclusively by such states and to be controlled exclusively by the members of the board representing such states provided such agreement is submitted to and approved by the board prior to the establishment of such institution.Each state agrees that, when authorized by the Legislature, it will from time to time make available and pay over to said board such funds as may be required for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of such regional educational institutions as may be authorized by the states under the terms of this compact, the contribution of each state at all times to be in the proportion that its population bears to the total combined population of the states who are parties hereto as shown from time to time by the most recent official published report of the bureau of the census of the United States of America; or upon such other basis as may be agreed upon.This compact shall not take effect or be binding upon any state unless and until it shall be approved by proper legislative action of as many as six or more of the states whose Governors have subscribed hereto within a period of eighteen months from the date hereof. When and if six or more states shall have given legislative approval of this compact within said eighteen months' period, it shall be and become binding upon such six or more states sixty days after the date of legislative approval by the sixth state; and the Governors of such six or more states shall forthwith name the members of the board from their states as hereinabove set out, and the board shall then meet on call of the Governor of any state approving this compact, at which time the board shall elect officers, adopt bylaws, appoint committees and otherwise fully organize. Other states whose names are subscribed hereto shall thereafter become parties hereto upon approval of this compact by legislative action within two years from the date hereof, upon such conditions as may be agreed upon at the time: Provided, however, That with respect to any state whose Constitution may require amendment in order to permit legislative approval of the compact, such state or states shall become parties hereto upon approval of this compact by legislative action within seven years from the date hereof, upon such conditions as may be agreed upon at the time.After becoming effective this compact shall thereafter continue without limitation of time: Provided, however, That it may be terminated at any time by unanimous action of the states: And provided further, That any state may withdraw from this compact if such withdrawal is approved by its Legislature, such withdrawal to become effective two years after written notice thereof to the board accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action, but such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations hereunder accruing up to the effective date of such withdrawal. Any state so withdrawing shall ipso facto cease to have any claim to or ownership of any of the property held or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of this compact.If any state shall at any time become in default in the performance of any of its obligations assumed herein or with respect to any obligation imposed upon said state as authorized by and in compliance with the terms and provisions of this compact, all rights, privileges and benefits of such defaulting state, its members on the board",

Such resolution shall prescribe the rights and duties of the bondholders and the board, and for such purpose may prescribe the form of the trust agreement hereinafter referred to. The bonds shall be of such series, bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding seven per centum per annum, payable semiannually; be in such denominations; be in such form, either coupon or fully registered without coupons, carrying such registration exchangeability and interchangeability privileges; be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places; be subject to such terms of redemption at such prices not exceeding one hundred five percent of the principal amount thereof, and be entitled to such priorities on the revenues paid into the special university capital improvements fund as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust agreement made in connection therewith. The bonds shall be signed by the Governor, and by the president of the board of regents, under the great seal of the state, attested by the Secretary of State, and the coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the president of the board.

If the proceeds of bonds issued for such building or buildings shall exceed the cost thereof, the surplus shall be paid into the sinking fund to be established for payment of the principal and interest of such bonds as hereinafter provided. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the board may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon their issuance.The bonds issued under the provisions of this article shall be and have all the qualities of negotiable instruments under the law merchant and the Uniform Commercial Code of this state.",

The eventual termination of the services in lieu of replacement or modernization would create an unreasonable hardship on patients in the area and throughout the state;(2) These purposes separately and collectively serve the highest public interest and are essential to the public health and welfare, but must be realized in the most efficient manner and at the lowest cost practicable and consistent with these purposes;(3) It is unnecessarily costly and administratively cumbersome for the board to finance, manage and carry out the patient care activities of an academic institution within the existing framework of a state agency. The patient care operations are more efficiently served by contemporary legal, management and procedural structures utilized by similarly situated private entities throughout the nation;(4) It is fiscally desirable that the state separate the business and service functions of the hospital from the educational functions of the health science schools, that the board cease operation of the existing facilities, that the board transfer the operations to the corporation, that the board pay certain existing sums and assign the assets and certain leasehold interests to the corporation in order to acquire the corporation's agreement to provide certain space and services and to assume the liabilities, that the agreement and certain other contractual relationships between the board and the corporation be authorized, and that the existing facilities operated by the corporation, and subsequently the new facilities owned and operated by the corporation, be self-sufficient and serve to remove the tax burden of operating the existing facilities from the state;(5) A not-for-profit corporate structure with appropriate governance consistent with the delivery of health care to the patient and academic need of the university is the best means of assuring prudent financial management and the future economy of operation under rapidly changing market conditions, regulation and reimbursement; and(6) The interests of the citizens of the state will be best met by the board's entering into and carrying out the provisions of the agreement as soon as possible, to provide independence and flexibility of management and funding while enabling the state's tertiary health care and health science education needs to be better served.(b) It is hereby found and determined with regard to the West Virginia health system that:(1) The interests of the citizens of the state will be best served by ensuring the continued vitality and viability of the West Virginia based health care institutions which are devoted to addressing the state's tertiary health care and health science education needs and which possess the flexibility and resources to effectively and efficiently compete in a rapidly changing health care environment;(2) The best interests of the state, and the mission and purposes of the corporation created by this article, will best be met by the authorization and creation of a West Virginia health system as a not-for-profit corporate structure to serve as the parent corporation of the corporation created pursuant to this article and other corporations and institutions;(3) The citizens of the state are best served by requiring representative governance by the board while maintaining flexibility so that the West Virginia health system may, over time, authorize and stimulate the creation of an integrated health care delivery system which may be comprised of one or more affiliated institutions; and(4) The citizens of the state are best served by the creation of a coordinated, integrated, efficient and effective health science and health care delivery system which is accountable to the citizens of the state, responsive to the health care and health science education needs of the citizens of the state, and responsive to the financial pressures of a dynamic health care environment.",

Such resolution shall prescribe the rights and duties of the bondholders and the board, and for such purpose may prescribe the form of the trust agreement hereinafter referred to. The bonds shall be of such series, bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding seven per centum per annum, payable semiannually; be in such denominations; be in such form, either coupon or fully registered without coupons, carrying such registration exchangeability and interchangeability privileges; be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places; be subject to such terms of redemption at such prices not exceeding one hundred five percent of the principal amount thereof, and be entitled to such priorities on the revenues paid into the special Marshall University capital improvements fund as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust agreement made in connection therewith.

If the proceeds of bonds issued for such building or buildings, improvements and land shall, together with the amount of any other funds used therefor as hereinbefore in this article authorized, exceed the cost thereof, the surplus shall be paid into the sinking fund or reserve fund to be established for payment of the principal and interest of such bonds as hereinafter provided.

Similar initiatives have been implemented in various states and have been very successful in safely distributing food consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration and local health agencies requirements.Therefore, the purpose of this section is to establish a statewide initiative to facilitate this worthwhile program.(b) The state board shall promulgate a rule in accordance with §29A-3B-1 et seq. of this code that provides policy guidance to county boards on the management and distribution of excess school food consistent with state and county health department and United States Food and Drug Administration requirements and guidelines for the distribution of excess foods. The guidance policy at a minimum shall provide a list of food products and methodologies for distribution that include, but are not limited to:(1) The types of foods that may be distributed;(2) Methods of distribution to make excess food available at other times during the school day;(3) Methods of distributing excess food to students to consume after school; and(4) Methods to otherwise donate excess food to persons or organizations providing food to persons or families suffering from food insecurity.(c) The preparation, safety, and donation of food made available to students during a regular school meal time and donated to a food bank or any other nonprofit charitable organization for distribution, shall comply with and be thereby covered by the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, §55-7D-1 et seq. of this code.(d) The methods of distributing excess food to students within a school may include a sharing table where food service staff, students and faculty may return appropriate food items consistent with state board guidelines to make those food items available to students during the school day.(e) Each county board of education shall establish a program to assist and encourage schools to participate in the Shared Table initiative.",
