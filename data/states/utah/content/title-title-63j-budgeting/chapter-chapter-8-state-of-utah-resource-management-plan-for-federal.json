Sec. 528, that lands within the national forests be managed according to the principles of multiple use; and\n\n(ii) the right which FLPMA, the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. Appendix 2, give to state and local governments to participate in all BLM and United States Forest Service efforts to plan for the responsible use of BLM and United States Forest Service lands and the requirement that BLM and the United States Forest Service coordinate planning efforts with those of state and local governments.\n\n(c) This section is a statement of the state of Utah's policy and plan for a desired transportation system for the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.\n\n(d) This section does not mandate compliance with this policy by the United States Forest Service nor does it override or usurp the United States Forest Service's authority within this area.\n\n(e) This section is a statement of state policy for use by the United States Forest Service and other interested stakeholders as required by federal law in making planning decisions and project management decisions within the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.\n\n(2) There is established and designated a state of Utah transportation plan for the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest in Garfield, Iron, Kane, and Wayne counties, Utah for the purpose of:\n\n(a) preserving and protecting against threats to the longstanding transportation networks that have served the public for decades within these ranger districts;\n\n(b) preserving and protecting against threats to the longstanding traditional recreation resource values that have served the public for decades within these ranger districts;\n\n(c) preserving and protecting against threats to the longstanding public road access that is vital to the agricultural livestock and forest products industries within these ranger districts;\n\n(d) preserving and protecting against threats to the significant history, culture, customs, and economic values in these ranger districts, and in the various communities situated near these ranger districts;\n\n(e) preserving and protecting against threats to the civil rights of the disabled, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged to have access to the great outdoor resource and values existing in these ranger districts;\n\n(f) preserving and protecting against threats to road networks vital to restoring, reclaiming, preserving, protecting, enhancing, and developing the state's water resources on the watersheds existing within these ranger districts;\n\n(g) protecting, preserving, and enhancing affected natural, historical, and cultural activities within these ranger districts from ongoing threats; and\n\n(h) preserving and protecting the longstanding network of publicly accessible roads within these ranger districts, in order to protect:\n\n(i) the health, safety, and welfare of citizens who live near these ranger districts, and persons who visit and recreate therein, from the threat of catastrophic fire and its resulting problems of watershed and habitat destruction, erosion, silt load, and flooding, which can only be managed, prevented, combatted, and mitigated through a proper transportation network throughout these ranger districts;\n\n(ii) hunter access to manage wildlife populations; and\n\n(iii) forage conditions for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.\n\n(3) The state of Utah transportation plan for the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest consists of all roads shown in the map jointly prepared by the Garfield, Iron, Kane, and Wayne County GIS departments in February 2014, entitled \"State of Utah Transportation Plan for Dixie National Forest,\" printed copies of which will be maintained by the Utah Association of Counties and made available to the public upon request.\n\n(4)\n\n(a)\n\n(i) The map described in Subsection (3) also documents the move by Dixie National Forest to close and otherwise deny the public's longstanding access to many of the roads shown on the map in the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts, by reason of the United States Forest Service's implementing a recent motorized travel plan for the Dixie National Forest.\n\n(ii) These closures and other denials of public road access through the motorized travel plan of the Dixie National Forest constitute an ongoing direct threat to the resources and values referenced in Subsection (2).\n\n(b) The state of Utah's transportation plan for these ranger districts conflicts with the United States Forest Service's recent motorized travel plan for the Dixie National Forest.\n\n(c) The state of Utah's transportation plan for these ranger districts recognizes that all roads shown on the map referenced in Subsection (3) should be kept open to the public.\n\n(5) The state finds that keeping open to the public all roads shown on the map referenced in Subsection (3) is necessary and vital to preserve and protect the values cited in Subsection (2).\n\n(6) The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest:\n\n(a) fully cooperate and coordinate with the state of Utah and the respective counties in which these ranger districts lie, to develop, amend, and implement United States Forest Service land and resource management plans and transportation plans, and implement management decisions pursuant to those plans, that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law;\n\n(b) enter into agreements regarding the maintenance, upkeep, and improvement of roads in these ranger districts;\n\n(c) refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine, restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies as stated in this section; and\n\n(d) refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary to the goals and purposes described within this section.\n\n(7)\n\n(a) The state recognizes the importance of longstanding road networks in all national forests in the state but establishes this transportation plan to provide special protection and preservation against the identified threats found to exist in the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.\n\n(b) It is the intent of the state to designate additional forest transportation plans in future years as circumstances warrant their special protection and preservation.\n\n(8) The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state of Utah, and local governments, to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management actions consistent with the goals and policies of this section for the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.\n\nEnacted by Chapter 361, 2014 General Session\n\nTechnically renumbered to avoid duplication of section number used in HB158, Chapter 321.",

inspection by the public at the offices of the Utah Association of Counties.\n\n(4) The state finds with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) that:\n\n(a) agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided a significant contribution to the history, customs, culture, economy, welfare, and other values of each area for more than 100 years;\n\n(b) the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones if managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestock activities and wildlife habitat;\n\n(c) agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources, human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks, structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition, preservation, and protection;\n\n(d)\n\n(i) the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation, restoration, and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and the restoration and development of historic, existing, and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to provide protection for the resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above; and\n\n(ii) notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sage grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with the management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistent with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;\n\n(e) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energy and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold, uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these zones; and\n\n(f) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any recreation resources, including roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use, sightseeing, canyoneering, hunting, fishing, trapping, and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these grazing zones.\n\n(5) The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2) that the historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each zone have greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to:\n\n(a) unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies, including:\n\n(i) de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non-WSAs;\n\n(ii) ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior applicable to each of these zones; and\n\n(iii) the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage;\n\n(b) inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions;\n\n(c) mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties;\n\n(d) improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasive species, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that:\n\n(i) compromise watershed and rangeland health;\n\n(ii) crowd out grazing forage;\n\n(iii) degrade habitat and limit wildlife populations;\n\n(iv) reduce water yield; and\n\n(v) heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire; and\n\n(e) other practices that degrade overall rangeland health.\n\n(6) To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection (5), the state supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2):\n\n(a) efficient and sustained policies, programs, and practices directed at preserving, restoring, and enhancing watershed and rangeland health to maximize:\n\n(i) all permitted forage production for livestock grazing and other compatible uses, including flexible grazing on and off dates adaptive to yearly climate and range conditions; and\n\n(ii) forage for fish and wildlife;\n\n(b) a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local government agencies to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development of:\n\n(i) forage resources for grazing livestock and wildlife; and\n\n(ii) other uses compatible with livestock grazing and wildlife utilization;\n\n(c) effective and responsible management of wild horses and burros to eliminate excess populations; and\n\n(d) effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat.\n\n(7) The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each grazing zone:\n\n(a) fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within which each grazing zone is situated to develop, amend, and implement land and resource management plans, and implement management decisions that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law;\n\n(b) expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of grazing permits, range improvements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop all existing and permitted grazing resources located within each grazing zone, including renewable vegetative resources;\n\n(c) allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines, pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles;\n\n(d) refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine, restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each grazing zone as stated in this section;\n\n(e) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary to the goals and purposes described within this section; and\n\n(f) refrain from implementing utilization standards less than 50%, unless:\n\n(i) implementing a standard of less than 50% utilization on a temporary basis is necessary to resolve site-specific concerns; and\n\n(ii) the federal agency consults, coordinates, and cooperates fully with local governments.\n\n(8)\n\n(a) If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a way as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a county or a county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk adversely affects the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that adverse effect:\n\n(i) Subsections 11-51-103(1)(a) and (b) shall govern and apply to the chief executive officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone; and\n\n(ii) Subsection 11-51-103(1)(b) shall govern and apply to the attorney general with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone.\n\n(b) If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a way as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a county or a county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk constitutes an imminent threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that imminent threat:\n\n(i) Subsections 11-51-103(2) and (3) shall govern and apply to the chief executive officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone; and\n\n(ii) Subsection 11-51-103(3) and Section 11-51-104 shall govern and apply to the attorney general with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone.\n\n(9)\n\n(a) The state recognizes the importance of all grazing districts on Utah BLM and Forest Service lands but establishes the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) to provide special protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection (5) to exist in these zones.\n\n(b) It is the intent of the state to designate additional grazing agricultural commodity zones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for new zones.\n\n(10) The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and local governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management actions in zones described in Subsection (2) in order to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies described in this section.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the zones described in Subsection (2) shall be governed by Sections 63L-11-302, 63L-11-303, and 63J-8-104.\n\nAmended by Chapter 382, 2021 General Session",

and\n\n(ii) notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sage grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with the management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistent with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;\n\n(e) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energy and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold, uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these zones;

and\n\n(iv) the arbitrary administrative reductions in timber, logging, and forest products activities;\n\n(b) improper management of forest vegetation resulting in the overcrowding of old growth alpine species and the crowding out of aspen diversity, all of which results in:\n\n(i) devastation of entire mountainsides due to insect infestation and disease;\n\n(ii) reduced water yield;\n\n(iii) increased catastrophic wildfire;\n\n(iv) increased soil erosion;\n\n(v) degradation of wildlife habitat; and\n\n(vi) suppression and threatened extinction of important rural economic activities; and\n\n(c) other practices that degrade overall forest health.\n\n(6) To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection (5), the state supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2):\n\n(a) efficient and responsible development, within each timber zone, of:\n\n(i) robust timber thinning and harvesting programs and activities; and\n\n(ii) other uses compatible with increased timber, logging, and forest product activities, including a return to historic levels of timber, logging, and forest product activity in each of these zones;\n\n(b) a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local governments to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development, within each timber zone, of:\n\n(i) forest product resources; and\n\n(ii) other uses compatible with timber activities; and\n\n(c) effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat.\n\n(7) The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each timber zone:\n\n(a) fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within which each timber zone is situated to develop, amend, and implement land and resource management plans and implement management decisions that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law;\n\n(b) expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of logging and forest product harvesting permits, range improvements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop existing and permitted timber resources located within each timber zone, including renewable vegetative resources;\n\n(c) expedite stewardship programs to allow private enterprise to carry out the timber, logging, and forest activities described in this section;\n\n(d) allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines, pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles;\n\n(e) refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine, restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each timber zone as stated in this section; and\n\n(f) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary to the goals and purposes described within this section.\n\n(8)\n\n(a) The state recognizes the importance of all areas on BLM and Forest Service lands high value lumber and forest product resources but establishes the special Timber Agricultural Commodity Zones to provide special protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection (5) to exist in these zones.\n\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to designate additional Timber Agricultural Commodity Zones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for new zones.\n\n(9) The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and local governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management actions in the zones described in Subsection (2).\n\n(10) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies, as well as its grazing policies, on land within zones described in Subsection (2), shall continue to be governed by Sections 63L-11-302, 63L-11-303, and 63J-8-104.\n\nAmended by Chapter 382, 2021 General Session",
