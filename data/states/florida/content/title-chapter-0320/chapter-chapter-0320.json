(2) Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that all services affecting motor carriers be consolidated in order to encourage interstate commerce and achieve maximum efficiency in registration, permitting, and safety programs administered by this state. In order to achieve this goal, Florida must join the cooperative effort that is being conducted on the national level by Congress, the United States Department of Transportation, and other groups to achieve uniformity among the jurisdictions and reduce the number of separate reports required by each jurisdiction of the motor carrier industry. Florida shall consolidate all requirements imposed on motor carriers operating in this state and shall actively negotiate reciprocal agreements and compacts with other jurisdictions to accomplish the intent of this chapter.

(b) The department shall prescribe a form upon which motor vehicle owners may record odometer readings when registering their motor vehicles. (3) Prior to the registration in this state of any vehicle registered outside the state, the application must be accompanied by either a sworn affidavit from the seller and purchaser verifying that the vehicle identification number shown on the affidavit is identical to the vehicle identification number shown on the motor vehicle or a copy of the appropriate departmental form evidencing that a physical examination has been made of the motor vehicle by the owner and by a duly constituted police officer of any state, a licensed motor vehicle dealer, a license inspector as provided by s. 320.58, or a notary public commissioned by any state and that the vehicle identification number shown on the applicable form and the application is identical to the vehicle identification number shown on the motor vehicle. Vehicle identification number verification is not required for any new vehicle sold in this state by a licensed motor vehicle dealer, any mobile home, any trailer or semitrailer with a net weight of less than 2,000 pounds, or any travel trailer or camping trailer.

The issuing agent shall refuse to issue registration if such proof of purchase is not provided. Insurers shall furnish uniform proof-of-purchase cards in a paper or electronic format in a form prescribed by the department and include the name of the insured’s insurance company, the coverage identification number, and the make, year, and vehicle identification number of the vehicle insured. The card must contain a statement notifying the applicant of the penalty specified under s. 316.646(4). The card or insurance policy, insurance policy binder, or certificate of insurance or a photocopy of any of these; an affidavit containing the name of the insured’s insurance company, the insured’s policy number, and the make and year of the vehicle insured; or such other proof as may be prescribed by the department shall constitute sufficient proof of purchase. If an affidavit is provided as proof, it must be in substantially the following form: Under penalty of perjury, I (Name of insured) do hereby certify that I have (Personal Injury Protection, Property Damage Liability, and, if required, Bodily Injury Liability) Insurance currently in effect with (Name of insurance company) under (Policy number) covering (Make, year, and vehicle identification number of vehicle) . (Signature of Insured) Such affidavit must include the following warning: WARNING: GIVING FALSE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A VEHICLE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE UNDER FLORIDA LAW. ANYONE GIVING FALSE INFORMATION ON THIS AFFIDAVIT IS SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION. If an application is made through a licensed motor vehicle dealer as required under s. 319.23, the original or a photostatic copy of such card, insurance policy, insurance policy binder, or certificate of insurance or the original affidavit from the insured shall be forwarded by the dealer to the tax collector of the county or the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for processing. By executing the aforesaid affidavit, no licensed motor vehicle dealer will be liable in damages for any inadequacy, insufficiency, or falsification of any statement contained therein. A card must also indicate the existence of any bodily injury liability insurance voluntarily purchased. (b) When an operator who owns a motor vehicle is subject to the financial responsibility requirements of chapter 324, including ss. 324.022 and 324.023, such operator shall provide proof of compliance with such financial responsibility requirements at the time of registration of any such motor vehicle by one of the methods constituting sufficient proof of purchase under paragraph (a). The issuing agent shall refuse to register a motor vehicle if such proof of purchase is not provided or if one of the other methods of proving financial responsibility as set forth in s. 324.031 is not met. (c) For purposes of providing proof of purchase of required insurance coverage under this subsection, the Office of Insurance Regulation of the Financial Services Commission shall require that uniform proof-of-purchase cards specified by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles be furnished by insurers writing motor vehicle liability insurance in this state. Any person altering or counterfeiting such a card or making a false affidavit in order to furnish false proof or to knowingly permit another person to furnish false proof is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (d) The verifying of proof of personal injury protection insurance, proof of property damage liability insurance, proof of combined bodily liability insurance and property damage liability insurance, or proof of financial responsibility insurance and the issuance or failure to issue the motor vehicle registration under the provisions of this chapter may not be construed in any court as a warranty of the reliability or accuracy of the evidence of such proof. Neither the department nor any tax collector is liable in damages for any inadequacy, insufficiency, falsification, or unauthorized modification of any item of the proof of personal injury protection insurance, proof of property damage liability insurance, proof of combined bodily liability insurance and property damage liability insurance, or proof of financial responsibility insurance prior to, during, or subsequent to the verification of the proof. The issuance of a motor vehicle registration does not constitute prima facie evidence or a presumption of insurance coverage. (e) Upon the expiration date noted in the cancellation notice that the department receives from the insurer, the department shall suspend the registration, issued under this chapter or s. 207.004(1), of a motor carrier who operates a commercial motor vehicle or who permits it to be operated in this state during the registration period without having in full force liability insurance, a surety bond, or a valid self-insurance certificate that complies with this section. The insurer shall provide notice to the department at the same time the cancellation notice is provided to the insured pursuant to s. 627.7281. The department may adopt rules regarding the electronic submission of the cancellation notice. (6) Any person who registers his or her motor vehicle by means of false or fraudulent representations made in any application for registration is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

When an application is made through a licensed motor vehicle dealer as required in s. 319.23, the original or photostatic copy of such prescribed proof shall be forwarded by the dealer to the tax collector or the department for processing. The issuing agent shall refuse to issue a registration if such prescribed proof is not presented. Any person making a false affidavit in order to furnish false proof or to knowingly permit another person to furnish such false proof is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

(b) The owner or person in charge of any vehicle that is issued a notice of violation pursuant to this section shall, within 30 days of the date of issuance shown on the notice, register the vehicle as required by this chapter or provide proof satisfactory to the department that the vehicle is exempt from such registration. If the vehicle is not registered or the proof is not provided on or after the 31st day following the date of issuance shown on the notice, the department is authorized to immobilize the vehicle by use of an immobilization device.

The department shall place the name of the registered owner of that vehicle on the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement plate for the vehicle purchased from the licensed motor vehicle dealer.

The lienor must maintain proof that written notice to surrender the vehicle was sent to each registered owner pursuant to s. 320.1316(1). A revalidation sticker or replacement license plate may not be issued for the identified vehicle until the person’s name no longer appears on the list, the person presents documentation from the lienor that the vehicle has been surrendered to the lienor, or a court orders the person’s name removed from the list as provided in s. 320.1316. The department may not withhold an initial registration in connection with an applicant’s purchase or lease of a motor vehicle solely because the applicant’s name is on the list created by s. 320.1316.

This service charge shall be retained by the department or by the tax collector, as the case may be, as other fees accruing to those offices. (b) A service charge of $1 shall also be imposed for the issuance of each license plate validation sticker, vessel decal, and mobile home sticker issued from an automated vending facility or printer dispenser machine. This service charge is payable to the department and shall be used to provide for automated vending facilities or printer dispenser machines that are used to dispense such stickers and decals by each tax collector’s or license tag agent’s employee. (c) The tax collector may impose an additional service charge of up to 50 cents on any transaction specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), or on any transaction specified in s. 319.32(2)(a) or s. 328.48 if such transaction occurs at a tax collector’s branch office. (2) The service charges shall be collected by the department on all applications handled directly from its office; and the proceeds thereof, together with any fees returned to it by the tax collector, shall be paid into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. No tax collector, deputy tax collector, or employee of the state or any county shall charge, collect, or receive any fee or compensation for services performed as notary public in connection with or incidental to the issuance of license plates or titles. The provisions of this subsection and of s. 116.38(2) prohibiting the charging, collecting, or receiving of notary public fees do not apply to any privately owned license plate agency appointed by the county manager of a charter county which has an appointed tax collector. (3) If a tax collector elects to exercise his or her authority to contract with a license plate agent, the tax collector may determine additional service charges to be collected by privately owned license plate agents approved by the tax collector. Additional service charges must be fully itemized and disclosed to the person paying the service charges to the license plate agent. The license plate agent shall enter into a contract with the tax collector regarding the disclosure of additional service charges. (4) The department may absorb all or any portion of any interchange, assessment, charge back, authorization or settlement or equivalent fees charged by financial institutions relating to a credit or debit card transaction. The department may request approval to establish additional budget authority to pay additional fees related to credit and debit card transactions pursuant to s. 216.177.

If such vehicle is registered in the name of more than one person, the birth month of the person whose name first appears on the registration shall be used to determine the registration period. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the 30-day period ending at midnight on the vehicle owner’s date of birth. (b) A motor vehicle or mobile home that is subject to registration under s. 320.08(1), (2), (3), (4)(a) or (b), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (11) is eligible for an extended registration period as defined in s. 320.01(19)(b). (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), the owner of a motor vehicle subject to paragraph (a) who has had his or her driver license suspended pursuant to a violation of s. 316.193 or pursuant to s. 322.26(2) for driving under the influence must obtain a 6-month registration as a condition of reinstating the license, subject to renewal during the 3-year period that financial responsibility requirements apply. The registration period begins the first day of the birth month of the owner and ends the last day of the fifth month immediately following the owner’s birth month. For such vehicles, the department shall issue a vehicle registration certificate that is valid for 6 months and shall issue a validation sticker that displays an expiration date of 6 months after the date of issuance. The license tax required by s. 320.08 and all other applicable license taxes shall be one-half of the amount otherwise required, except the service charge required by s. 320.04 shall be paid in full for each 6-month registration. A vehicle required to be registered under this paragraph is not eligible for the extended registration period under paragraph (b). (2) For a vehicle subject to registration under s. 320.08(11) and not owned by a natural person, the registration period begins January 1 and ends December 31. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the 31-day period before expiration. (3) For a vehicle subject to registration under s. 320.08(12), the registration period runs concurrently with the licensing period. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the first month of the licensing period. (4) For a vehicle subject to registration under s. 320.08(13), for vehicles subject to registration under s. 320.08(6)(a) that are short-term rental vehicles, and for any vehicle for which a registration period is not otherwise specified, the registration period begins June 1 and ends May 31. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the 30-day period beginning June 1. (5) For a vehicle subject to apportioned registration under s. 320.08(4)(c)-(n), (5)(a)1. or (e), (6)(b), or (14), the registration period shall be a period of 12 months beginning in a month designated by the department and ending on the last day of the 12th month. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the last month of the registration period. The registration period may be shortened or extended at the discretion of the department, on receipt of the appropriate prorated fees, in order to evenly distribute such registrations on a monthly basis. For a vehicle subject to nonapportioned registration under s. 320.08(4)(c)-(n), (5)(a)1., (6)(b), or (14), the registration period begins December 1 and ends November 30. The renewal period is the 31-day period beginning December 1. (6) For those vehicles subject to registration under s. 320.08(6)(a) which are not short-term rental vehicles, the department shall develop and implement a registration renewal system that, where practicable, evenly distributes the registration renewal period throughout the year. For a vehicle subject to this registration period, the renewal period is the first month of the assigned registration period. (7) For those vehicles subject to registration under s. 320.0657, the department shall implement a system that distributes the registration renewal process throughout the year.

      "text": "320.0657 Permanent registration; fleet license plates.— (1) As used in this section, the term “fleet” means nonapportioned motor vehicles owned or leased by a company and used for business purposes. A fleet consists of a minimum of 100 motor vehicles or a minimum of 25 trailers or semitrailers. Vehicles registered as short-term rental vehicles are excluded from the provisions of this section. (2)(a) The owner or lessee of a fleet of motor vehicles shall, upon application in the manner and at the time prescribed and upon approval by the department and payment of the license tax prescribed under s. 320.08(2), (3), (4), (5)(a) and (b), (6)(a), (7), and (8), be issued permanent fleet license plates. All vehicles with a fleet license plate shall have the company’s name or logo and unit number displayed so that they are readily identifiable. (b) The plates, which shall be of a distinctive color, shall have the word “Fleet” appearing at the bottom and the word “Florida” appearing at the top unless the license plate is a specialty license plate as authorized in s. 320.08056. The plates shall conform in all respects to the provisions of this chapter, except as specified herein. For additional fees as set forth in s. 320.08056, fleet companies may purchase specialty license plates in lieu of the standard fleet license plates. Fleet companies shall be responsible for all costs associated with the specialty license plate, including all annual use fees, processing fees, fees associated with switching license plate types, and any other applicable fees. (c) In addition to the license tax prescribed by s. 320.08(2), (3), (4), (5)(a) and (b), (6)(a), (7), and (8), an annual fleet management fee of $2 shall be charged. A one-time license plate manufacturing fee of $1.50 shall be charged for plates issued for the established number of vehicles in the fleet. If the size of the fleet is increased, an issuance fee of $10 per vehicle will be charged to include the license plate manufacturing fee. If the license plate manufacturing cost increases, the department shall increase the license plate manufacturing fee to recoup its cost. Fees collected shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. Payment of registration license tax and fees shall be made annually and be evidenced only by the issuance of a single receipt by the department. The provisions of s. 320.0605 do not apply to vehicles registered in accordance with this section, and no annual validation sticker is required. (3) If a recipient of fleet license plates fails to properly and timely renew or initially register vehicles in its fleet, the department may impose a delinquency penalty of $50 or 10 percent of the delinquent taxes due, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 30 days, with an additional 10 percent penalty for each additional 30 days, or fraction thereof, that the failure continues, not to exceed a total penalty of 100 percent in the aggregate; however, the penalty may not be less than $50. (4) All recipients of fleet license plates authorized by this section must provide the department with an annual vehicle reconciliation and must annually surrender all unassigned license plates. Failure to comply with this subsection may result in fines of up to $1,000 for each occurrence, or in suspension or termination from the fleet program.

(4)(a) In addition to a penalty provided in subsection (3), a delinquent fee based on the following schedule of license taxes shall be imposed on any applicant who fails to renew a registration prior to the end of the month in which renewal registration is due. The delinquent fee shall be applied beginning on the 11th calendar day of the month succeeding the renewal period. The delinquent fee does not apply to those vehicles that have not been required to be registered during the preceding registration period or as provided in s. 320.18(2).

The official receipt authorized by 1 s. 316.545(6) constitutes proof of payment of the penalty authorized in s. 316.545(2)(b). (c) The owner of a leased motor vehicle is not responsible for any delinquent fee specified in this subsection if the motor vehicle is registered in the name of the lessee of the motor vehicle. (5) Any servicemember, as defined in s. 250.01, whose motor vehicle or mobile home registration has expired while he or she was serving on active duty or state active duty may renew his or her registration upon return from active duty or state active duty without penalty, if the servicemember served on active duty or state active duty 35 miles or more from the servicemember’s home of record prior to entering active duty or state active duty. The servicemember must provide to the department either a copy of the official military orders or a written verification signed by the servicemember’s commanding officer to receive a waiver of delinquent fees.

(4) The department is authorized to reject requests deemed by it to be objectionable, and the department is further authorized to recall, during a registration period, any issued personalized license plate determined by it to be obscene or otherwise objectionable. (5) Any application rejected by the department shall be returned to the applicant, along with the tax and fees submitted, within 15 days after the receipt of the application. If any personalized license plate is recalled within a current registration period, the department shall refund the prestige plate use fee of $10, the special fee of 50 cents, and the portion of the license tax, computed on a monthly basis, for the unused balance of the registration period. (6) A personalized prestige license plate shall be issued for the exclusive continuing use of the applicant. An exact duplicate of any plate may not be issued to any other applicant during the same registration period. An exact duplicate may not be issued for any succeeding year unless the previous owner of a specific plate relinquishes it by failure to apply for renewal or reissuance for 1 year following the last year of issuance. (7) If a vehicle owner who has been issued a personalized prestige license plate acquires a replacement vehicle within a registration period, the department shall authorize a transfer of a prestige license plate to the replacement vehicle in accordance with the provisions of s. 320.0609. There will be no refund of the annual use fee or processing fee. (8)(a) Personalized prestige license plates shall consist of three types of plates as follows: 1. A plate imprinted with numerals only. Such plates shall consist of numerals from 1 to 999, inclusive. 2. A plate imprinted with capital letters only. Such plates shall consist of capital letters “A” through “Z” and shall be limited to a total of seven of the same or different capital letters. A hyphen may be added in addition to the seven letters. 3. A plate imprinted with both capital letters and numerals. Such plates shall consist of no more than a total of seven characters, including both numerals and capital letters, in any combination, except that a hyphen may be added in addition to the seven characters if desired or needed. However, on those plates issued to, and bearing the names of, organizations, the letters and numerals shall be of such size, if necessary, as to accommodate a maximum of 18 digits for automobiles, trucks, and recreational vehicles and 7 digits for motorcycles. Plates consisting of the four capital letters “PRES” preceded or followed by a hyphen and numerals of 1 to 999 shall be reserved for issuance only to applicants who qualify as members of the press and who are associated with, or are employees of, the reporting media. (b) Personalized prestige plates must be of the same material, size, and distinctive color as any license plates authorized by this chapter and issued by the state for any registration period; however, the imprinting of personalized prestige license plates shall be limited solely to the following: 1. The letters or numerals or combination of both requested by the applicant must be stamped in large bold letters and numerals, limited to the number of characters based on the specific design of the plate requested by the applicant. 2. The word “Florida” must be stamped across the bottom of the plate in small letters, unless the word “Florida” is required to be stamped across the top of the plate according to the specific design of the plate.

(2)(a) Within 120 days after the specialty license plate becomes law, the department shall establish a method to issue a specialty license plate voucher to allow for the presale of the specialty license plate. The processing fee as prescribed in s. 320.08056, the service charge and branch fee as prescribed in s. 320.04, and the annual use fee as prescribed in s. 320.08056 shall be charged for the voucher. All other applicable fees shall be charged at the time of issuance of the license plates. (b) Within 24 months after the presale specialty license plate voucher is established, the approved specialty license plate organization must record with the department a minimum of 3,000 voucher sales before manufacture of the license plate may commence. The department shall extend this presale period by an additional 24 months for an approved specialty license plate organization that, as of June 15, 2022, is in the presale period but has not recorded at least 3,000 voucher sales. If, at the conclusion of the presale period, the minimum sales requirement has not been met, the specialty plate is deauthorized, and the department shall discontinue development of the plate and discontinue issuance of the presale vouchers. Upon deauthorization of the license plate or if the plate has met the presale requirement but has not been issued, a purchaser of the license plate voucher may use the annual use fee collected as a credit towards any other specialty license plate or apply for a refund on a form prescribed by the department. (3)(a) New specialty license plates that have been approved by law but are awaiting issuance under paragraph (b) shall be issued in the order they appear in s. 320.08058 provided that they have met the presale requirement. All other provisions of this section must also be met before a specialty license plate may be issued. If the next awaiting specialty license plate has not met the presale requirement, the department shall proceed in the order provided in s. 320.08058 to identify the next qualified specialty license plate that has met the presale requirement. The department shall cycle through the list in statutory order. (b) If the Legislature has approved 135 or more specialty license plates, the department may not issue any new specialty license plates until a sufficient number of plates are discontinued pursuant to s. 320.08056(8) such that the number of plates being issued does not exceed 135. Notwithstanding s. 320.08056(8)(a), the 135-license-plate limit includes license plates above the minimum sales threshold and those exempt from that threshold. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the department shall extend the presale period for the Florida State Beekeepers Association by an additional 12 months.

(2)(a) The department shall issue a specialty license plate to the owner or lessee of any motor vehicle, except a vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan, a commercial truck required to display two license plates pursuant to s. 320.0706, or a truck tractor, upon request and payment of the appropriate license tax and fees. (b) The department may authorize dealer and fleet specialty license plates.

(d) Unless the amount of an annual use fee is otherwise specified in subsection (4) for a particular specialty license plate, an annual use fee of $25 for any specialty license plate that is required to be developed under s. 320.08058. A request may be made any time during a registration period. If a request is made for a specialty license plate to replace a current valid license plate, the specialty license plate must be issued with appropriate decals attached at no tax for the plate, but all fees and service charges must be paid. If a request is made for a specialty license plate at the beginning of the registration period, the tax, together with all applicable fees and service charges, must be paid. (4) The following license plate annual use fees shall be collected for the appropriate specialty license plates: (a) Challenger/Columbia license plate, $25, except that a person who purchases 1,000 or more of such license plates shall pay an annual use fee of $15 per plate.

(y) Aquaculture license plate, $25, except that for an owner purchasing the specialty license plate for more than 10 vehicles registered to that owner, the annual use fee shall be $10 per plate. (5) If a vehicle owner or lessee to whom the department has issued a specialty license plate acquires a replacement vehicle within the owner’s registration period, the department must authorize a transfer of the specialty license plate to the replacement vehicle in accordance with s. 320.0609. The annual use fee or processing fee may not be refunded. (6) Specialty license plates must bear the design required by law for the appropriate specialty license plate, and the designs and colors must conform to the department’s design specifications. In addition to a design, the specialty license plates may bear the imprint of numerals from 1 to 999, inclusive, capital letters “A” through “Z,” or a combination thereof. The department shall determine the maximum number of characters, including both numerals and letters. All specialty license plates must be otherwise of the same material and size as standard license plates issued for any registration period. A specialty license plate may bear an appropriate slogan, emblem, or logo in a size and placement that conforms to the department’s design specifications. The sponsoring organization’s Internet domain name may appear on the plate. (7) The department shall annually retain from the first proceeds derived from the annual use fees collected an amount sufficient to defray each specialty plate’s pro rata share of the department’s costs directly related to the specialty license plate program. Such costs shall include inventory costs, distribution costs, direct costs to the department, costs associated with reviewing each organization’s compliance with audit and attestation requirements of s. 320.08062, and any applicable increased costs of manufacturing the specialty license plate. Any cost increase to the department related to actual cost of the plate, including a reasonable vendor profit, shall be verified by the Department of Management Services. The balance of the proceeds from the annual use fees collected for that specialty license plate shall be distributed as provided by law. (8)(a) The department must discontinue the issuance of an approved specialty license plate if the number of valid specialty plate registrations falls below 3,000, or in the case of an out-of-state college or university license plate, 4,000, for at least 12 consecutive months. The department shall mail a warning letter to the sponsoring organization following the first month in which the total number of valid specialty plate registrations is below 3,000, or in the case of an out-of-state college or university license plate, 4,000. This paragraph does not apply to in-state collegiate license plates established under s. 320.08058(3), license plates of institutions in and entities of the State University System, specialty license plates that have statutory eligibility limitations for purchase, specialty license plates for which annual use fees are distributed by a foundation for student and teacher leadership programs and teacher recruitment and retention, or Florida Professional Sports Team license plates established under s. 320.08058(9). (b) The department is authorized to discontinue the issuance of a specialty license plate and distribution of associated annual use fee proceeds if the organization no longer exists, if the organization has stopped providing services that are authorized to be funded from the annual use fee proceeds, if the organization does not meet the presale requirements as prescribed in s. 320.08053, or pursuant to an organizational recipient’s request. Organizations shall notify the department immediately to stop all warrants for plate sales if any of the conditions in this section exist and must meet the requirements of s. 320.08062 for any period of operation during a fiscal year. (c) A vehicle owner or lessee issued a specialty license plate that has been discontinued by the department may keep the discontinued specialty license plate for the remainder of the 10-year license plate replacement period and must pay all other applicable registration fees. However, such owner or lessee is exempt from paying the applicable specialty license plate annual use fee under paragraph (3)(d) or subsection (4) for the remainder of the 10-year license plate replacement period. (d) If the department discontinues issuance of a specialty license plate, all annual use fees held or collected by the department shall be distributed within 180 days after the date the specialty license plate is discontinued. Of those fees, the department shall retain an amount sufficient to defray the applicable administrative and inventory closeout costs associated with discontinuance of the plate. All remaining proceeds shall be distributed to the appropriate organization or organizations pursuant to s. 320.08058. (e) If an organization that is the intended recipient of the funds pursuant to s. 320.08058 no longer exists, the department shall deposit any undisbursed proceeds into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), on January 1 of each year, the department shall discontinue the specialty license plate with the fewest number of plates in circulation, including license plates exempt from a statutory sales requirement. The department shall mail a warning letter to the sponsoring organizations of the 10 percent of specialty license plates with the lowest number of valid, active registrations as of December 1 of each year. This paragraph does not apply to collegiate license plates established under s. 320.08058(3). (9) The organization that requested the specialty license plate may not redesign the specialty license plate unless the inventory of those plates has been depleted. However, the organization may purchase the remaining inventory of the specialty license plates from the department at cost.

(b) For a casual or private sale, including the sale of a marine boat trailer by a marine boat trailer dealer. A “casual or private sale” means any sale other than that by a licensed dealer. (c) For certified common carriers or driveaway companies who transport motor vehicles, mobile homes, or recreational vehicles from one place to another for persons other than themselves. (d) For banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions which are not required to be licensed under the provisions of s. 320.27, s. 320.77, or s. 320.771, but need temporary tags for the purpose of demonstrating repossessions for sale. (e) Where a motor vehicle is sold in this state to a resident of another state for registration therein and the motor vehicle is not required to be registered under the provisions of s. 320.38. (f) Where a motor vehicle is required to be weighed or emission tested prior to registration or have a vehicle identification number verified. A temporary tag issued for any of these purposes shall be valid for 10 days. (g) Where an out-of-state resident, subject to registration in this state, must secure ownership documentation from the home state. (h) For a rental car company which possesses a motor vehicle dealer license and which may use temporary tags on vehicles offered for lease by such company in accordance with the provisions of rules established by the department. However, the original issuance date of a temporary tag shall be the date which determines the applicable license plate fee. (i) In the resolution of a consumer complaint where there is a need to issue more than two temporary tags, the department may do so. (j) While a personalized prestige or specialty license plate is being manufactured for use upon the motor vehicle. A temporary tag issued for this purpose shall be valid for 90 days. (k) In any case where a permanent license plate cannot legally be issued to an applicant and a temporary license plate is not specifically authorized under the provisions of this section, the department shall have the discretion to issue or authorize agents or Florida licensed dealers to issue temporary license plates to applicants demonstrating a need for such temporary use. (l) For use by licensed dealers to transport motor vehicles and recreational vehicles from the dealer’s licensed location to an off-premise sales location and return. Temporary tags used for such purposes shall be issued to the licensed dealer who owns the vehicles. (m) When the existing owner of a vehicle has submitted an application to transfer a valid out-of-state title that is subject to a lien. A temporary tag issued for this purpose shall be valid for 60 days. (n) When an active-duty military servicemember who has a valid Florida driver license provides evidence satisfactory to the department that he or she is deployed outside this state. A temporary tag issued for this purpose shall be valid for 60 days. Further, the department is authorized to disallow the purchase of temporary tags by licensed dealers, common carriers, or financial institutions in those cases where abuse has occurred. (2) The department may sell temporary tags, in addition to those listed above, to its agents and where need is demonstrated by a consumer complainant. The fee for a temporary tag issued under this section shall be $2 each. One dollar from each tag sold shall be deposited into the Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Program Trust Fund, with the remaining proceeds being deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. Agents of the department shall sell temporary tags for $2 each and shall charge the service charge authorized by s. 320.04 per transaction, regardless of the quantity sold. Except as specifically provided otherwise, a temporary tag issued under this section shall be valid for 30 days, and no more than two shall be issued to the same person for the same vehicle. (3) Any person or corporation who unlawfully issues or uses a temporary tag or violates this section or any rule adopted by the department to implement this section commits a noncriminal infraction, punishable as a moving violation as provided in chapter 318 in addition to other administrative action by the department. Using a temporary tag that has been expired for a period of 7 days or less is a noncriminal infraction, and is a nonmoving violation punishable as provided for in chapter 318. (4)(a) Temporary tags shall be conspicuously displayed in the rear license plate bracket or, on vehicles requiring front display of license plates, on the front of the vehicle in the location where the metal license plate would normally be displayed. (b) The department shall designate specifications for the media upon which the temporary tag is printed. Such media shall be either nonpermeable or subject to weatherproofing so that it maintains its structural integrity, including graphic and data adhesion, in all weather conditions after being placed on a vehicle. (5) Any person who knowingly and willfully abuses or misuses temporary tag issuance to avoid registering a vehicle requiring registration pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319 commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (6) Any person who knowingly and willfully issues a temporary tag or causes another to issue a temporary tag to a fictitious person or entity to avoid disclosure of the true owner of a vehicle commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (7) Any person authorized by this section to purchase and issue a temporary tag shall maintain records as required by this chapter or departmental rules, and such records shall be open to inspection by the department or its agents during reasonable business hours. Any person who knowingly and willfully fails to comply with this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (8) The department shall administer an electronic system for licensed motor vehicle dealers to use for issuing temporary tags. If a dealer fails to comply with the department’s requirements for issuing temporary tags using the electronic system, the department may deny, suspend, or revoke a license under s. 320.27(9)(b)16. upon proof that the licensee has failed to comply with the department’s requirements. The department may adopt rules to administer this section. (9)(a) The department shall implement a secure print-on-demand electronic temporary tag registration, record retention, and issue system required for use by every department-authorized issuer of temporary tags by the end of the 2007-2008 fiscal year. Such system shall enable the department to issue, on demand, a temporary tag number in response to a request from the issuer by way of a secure electronic exchange of data and then enable the issuer to print the temporary tag 1 that has all required information. A motor vehicle dealer licensed under this chapter 2 may charge a fee to comply with this subsection. (b) To ensure the continuation of operations for issuers if a system outage occurs, the department shall allow the limited use of a backup manual issuance method during an outage which requires recordkeeping of information as determined by the department and which requires the timely electronic reporting of this information to the department. (c) The department may adopt rules necessary to 3 administer this subsection. Such rules may include exemptions from the requirements of this subsection as feasibly required to 3 administer the program, as well as exemptions for issuers who do not require a dealer license under this chapter because of the type or size of vehicle being sold.

      "text": "320.1316 Failure to surrender vehicle or vessel.— (1) Upon receipt from a lienor who claims a lien on a vehicle pursuant to s. 319.27 by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles of written notice to surrender a vehicle or vessel that has been disposed of, concealed, removed, or destroyed by the lienee, the department shall place the name of the registered owner of that vehicle on the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement license plate. Pursuant to s. 320.03(8), the department may not issue a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement license plate for the vehicle, or a vessel registration number or decal for the vessel, owned by the lienee which is identified in the claim by the lienor. If the vehicle is owned jointly, the name of each registered owner shall be placed on the list. (2) The notice to surrender the vehicle or vessel shall be signed under oath by the lienor and submitted on forms developed by the department, which must include: (a) The name, address, and telephone number of the lienor. (b) The name of the registered owner of the vehicle or vessel and the address to which the lienor provided notice to surrender the vehicle or vessel to the registered owner. (c) A general description of the vehicle, including its color, make, model, body style, and year. (d) The vehicle identification number, registration license plate number, if known, or other identification number, as applicable. (3) The registered owner of the vehicle or vessel may dispute a notice to surrender the vehicle or vessel or his or her inclusion on the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement license plate under s. 320.03(8), or a vessel registration number or decal, by bringing a civil action in the county in which he or she resides. (4) In an action brought pursuant to subsection (3), the petitioner is entitled to the summary procedure specified in s. 51.011, and the court shall advance the cause on its calendar if requested by the petitioner. (5) At a hearing challenging the refusal to issue a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement license plate under s. 320.03(8), or a vessel registration number or decal, the court shall first determine whether the lienor has a recorded lien on the vehicle or vessel and whether the lienor properly made a demand for the surrender of the vehicle or vessel in accordance with this section. If the court determines that the lien was recorded and that such a demand was properly made, the court shall determine whether good cause exists for the lienee’s failure to surrender the vehicle or vessel. As used in this section, the term “good cause” is limited to proof that: (a) The vehicle that was the subject of the demand for surrender was traded in to a licensed motor vehicle dealer before the date of the demand for surrender; (b) The lien giving rise to the inclusion on the list has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied; (c) There is ongoing litigation relating to the validity or enforceability of the lien; (d) The petitioner was in compliance with all of his or her contractual obligations with the lienholder at the time of the demand for surrender; (e) The vehicle or vessel was reported to law enforcement as stolen by the registered owner of the vehicle or vessel before the demand for surrender; or (f) The petitioner no longer has possession of the vehicle or vessel, and the loss of possession occurred pursuant to operation of law. If the petitioner’s loss of possession did not occur pursuant to operation of law, the fact that a third party has physical possession of the vehicle or vessel does not constitute good cause for the failure to surrender the vehicle or vessel. (6) If the petitioner establishes good cause for his or her failure to surrender the vehicle or vessel, the court shall enter an order removing the petitioner’s name from the list of those persons who may not be issued a license plate, revalidation sticker, or replacement license plate under s. 320.03(8), or a vessel registration number or decal, and shall award the petitioner reasonable attorney fees and costs actually incurred for the proceeding. (7) If the court finds that the demand for surrender was properly made by the lienor and the petitioner fails to establish good cause for the failure to surrender the vehicle or vessel, the court shall award the lienor reasonable attorney fees and costs actually incurred for the proceeding.

The department may cancel any vehicle or vessel registration, driver license, identification card, or fuel-use tax decal if the owner or co-owner pays for any vehicle or vessel registration, driver license, identification card, or fuel-use tax decal; pays any administrative, delinquency, or reinstatement fee; or pays any tax liability, penalty, or interest specified in chapter 207 by a dishonored check, or if the vehicle owner or motor carrier has failed to pay a penalty for a weight or safety violation issued by the Department of Transportation or the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

      "text": "320.20 Disposition of license tax moneys.—The revenue derived from the registration of motor vehicles, including any delinquent fees and excluding those revenues collected and distributed under the provisions of s. 320.081, must be distributed monthly, as collected, as follows: (1) The first proceeds, to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of s. 18, Art. XII of the State Constitution of 1885, as adopted by s. 9(d), Art. XII of the State Constitution, and the additional provisions of s. 9(d) and s. 1010.57, must be deposited in the district Capital Outlay and Debt Service School Trust Fund. (2) Twenty-five million dollars per year of such revenues must be deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund, with priority use assigned to completion of the interstate highway system. However, any excess funds may be utilized for general transportation purposes, consistent with the Department of Transportation’s legislatively approved objectives. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law except subsections (1) and (2), $15 million shall be deposited annually into the State Transportation Trust Fund solely for the purposes of funding the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Program as provided in chapter 311. Such revenues shall be distributed on a 50-50 matching basis to any port listed in s. 311.09(1) to be used for funding projects as described in s. 311.07(3)(b). Such revenues may be assigned, pledged, or set aside as a trust for the payment of principal or interest on bonds, tax anticipation certificates, or any other form of indebtedness issued by an individual port or appropriate local government having jurisdiction thereof, or collectively by interlocal agreement among any of the ports, or used to purchase credit support to permit such borrowings. However, such debt is not a general obligation of the state. The state covenants with holders of such revenue bonds or other instruments of indebtedness issued that it will not repeal or impair or amend in any manner that will materially and adversely affect the rights of such holders so long as bonds authorized by this section are outstanding. Any revenues that are not pledged to the repayment of bonds authorized by this section may be used for purposes authorized under the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Program. This revenue source is in addition to any amounts provided and appropriated in accordance with s. 311.07. The Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Council shall approve the distribution of funds to ports for projects that have been approved pursuant to s. 311.09(5)-(8). The council and the Department of Transportation may perform acts required to facilitate and implement this subsection. To better enable the ports to cooperate to their mutual advantage, the governing body of each port may exercise powers provided to municipalities or counties in s. 163.01(7)(d) subject to chapter 311 and special acts, if any, pertaining to a port. The use of funds provided pursuant to this subsection are limited to eligible projects listed in this subsection. Income derived from a project completed with the use of program funds, beyond operating costs and debt service, is restricted solely to further port capital improvements consistent with maritime purposes. Use of such income for nonmaritime purposes is prohibited. The revenues available under this subsection may not be pledged to the payment of any bonds other than the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds currently outstanding; however, such revenues may be pledged to secure payment of refunding bonds to refinance the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds. Refunding bonds secured by revenues available under this subsection may not be issued with a final maturity later than the final maturity of the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds or which provide for higher debt service in any year than is currently payable on such bonds. Any revenue bonds or other indebtedness issued after July 1, 2000, other than refunding bonds shall be issued by the Division of Bond Finance at the request of the Department of Transportation pursuant to the State Bond Act. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law except subsections (1), (2), and (3), $10 million shall be deposited annually into the State Transportation Trust Fund solely for the purposes of funding the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Program as provided in chapter 311 and for funding seaport intermodal access projects of statewide significance as provided in s. 341.053. Such revenues shall be distributed to any port listed in s. 311.09(1), to be used for funding projects as follows: (a) For any seaport intermodal access projects that are identified in the 1997-1998 Tentative Work Program of the Department of Transportation, up to the amounts needed to offset the funding requirements of this section. (b) For seaport intermodal access projects as described in s. 341.053(6) which are identified in the 5-year Florida Seaport Mission Plan as provided in s. 311.09(3). Funding for such projects shall be on a matching basis as mutually determined by the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Council and the Department of Transportation if a minimum of 25 percent of total project funds come from any port funds, local funds, private funds, or specifically earmarked federal funds. (c) On a 50-50 matching basis for projects as described in s. 311.07(3)(b). (d) For seaport intermodal access projects that involve the dredging or deepening of channels, turning basins, or harbors; or the rehabilitation of wharves, docks, or similar structures. Funding for such projects requires a 25 percent match of the funds received pursuant to this subsection. Matching funds must come from port funds, federal funds, local funds, or private funds. Such revenues may be assigned, pledged, or set aside as a trust for the payment of principal or interest on bonds, tax anticipation certificates, or other form of indebtedness issued by an individual port or appropriate local government having jurisdiction thereof, or collectively by interlocal agreement among any of the ports, or used to purchase credit support to permit such borrowings. However, such debt is not a general obligation of the state. This state covenants with holders of such revenue bonds or other instruments of indebtedness issued hereunder that it will not repeal, impair, or amend this subsection in a manner that will materially and adversely affect the rights of holders while bonds authorized by this subsection remain outstanding. Revenues that are not pledged to the repayment of bonds as authorized by this section may be used for purposes authorized under the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Program. This revenue source is in addition to any amounts provided for and appropriated in accordance with s. 311.07 and subsection (3). The Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Council shall approve distribution of funds to ports for projects that have been approved pursuant to s. 311.09(5)-(8), or for seaport intermodal access projects identified in the 5-year Florida Seaport Mission Plan as provided in s. 311.09(3) and mutually agreed upon by the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Council and the Department of Transportation. All contracts for actual construction of projects authorized by this subsection must include a provision encouraging employment of participants in the welfare transition program. The goal for such employment is 25 percent of all new employees employed specifically for the project, unless the Department of Transportation and the Florida Seaport Transportation and Economic Development Council demonstrate that such a requirement would severely hamper the successful completion of the project. In such an instance, CareerSource Florida, Inc., shall establish an appropriate percentage of employees who are participants in the welfare transition program. The council and the Department of Transportation may perform such acts as are required to facilitate and implement the provisions of this subsection. To better enable the ports to cooperate to their mutual advantage, the governing body of each port may exercise powers provided to municipalities or counties in s. 163.01(7)(d) subject to the provisions of chapter 311 and special acts, if any, pertaining to a port. The use of funds provided pursuant to this subsection is limited to eligible projects listed in this subsection. The revenues available under this subsection may not be pledged to the payment of any bonds other than the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds currently outstanding; however, such revenues may be pledged to secure payment of refunding bonds to refinance the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds. Refunding bonds secured by revenues available under this subsection may not be issued with a final maturity later than the final maturity of the Florida Ports Financing Commission Series 1996 and Series 1999 Bonds and may not provide for higher debt service in any year than is currently payable on such bonds. Any revenue bonds or other indebtedness issued after July 1, 2000, other than refunding bonds shall be issued by the Division of Bond Finance at the request of the Department of Transportation pursuant to the State Bond Act. (5)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), the remainder of such revenues must be deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund. (b) The Chief Financial Officer each month shall deposit in the State Transportation Trust Fund an amount, drawn from other funds in the State Treasury which are not immediately needed or are otherwise in excess of the amount necessary to meet the requirements of the State Treasury, which when added to such remaining revenues each month will equal one-twelfth of the amount of the anticipated annual revenues to be deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund under paragraph (a) as determined by the Chief Financial Officer after consultation with the Revenue Estimating Conference held pursuant to s. 216.136(3). The transfers required hereunder may be suspended by action of the Legislative Budget Commission in the event of a significant shortfall of state revenues. (c) In any month in which the remaining revenues derived from the registration of motor vehicles exceed one-twelfth of those anticipated annual remaining revenues as determined by the Chief Financial Officer after consultation with the Revenue Estimating Conference, the excess shall be credited to those state funds in the State Treasury from which the amount was originally drawn, up to the amount which was deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund under paragraph (b). A final adjustment must be made in the last months of a fiscal year so that the total revenue deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund each year equals the amount derived from the registration of motor vehicles, less the amount distributed under subsection (1). For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (b), the term “remaining revenues” means all revenues deposited into the State Transportation Trust Fund under paragraph (a) and subsections (2) and (3). In order that interest earnings continue to accrue to the General Revenue Fund, the Department of Transportation may not invest an amount equal to the cumulative amount of funds deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund under paragraph (b) less funds credited under this paragraph as computed on a monthly basis. The amounts to be credited under this and the preceding paragraph must be calculated and certified to the Chief Financial Officer by the Executive Office of the Governor.

(b) “Motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle of the type and kind required to be registered and titled under chapter 319 and this chapter, except a recreational vehicle, moped, motorcycle powered by a motor with a displacement of 50 cubic centimeters or less, or mobile home. (c) “Motor vehicle dealer” means any person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles or offering or displaying motor vehicles for sale at wholesale or retail, or who may service and repair motor vehicles pursuant to an agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1). Any person who buys, sells, or deals in three or more motor vehicles in any 12-month period or who offers or displays for sale three or more motor vehicles in any 12-month period shall be prima facie presumed to be engaged in such business. The terms “selling” and “sale” include lease-purchase transactions. A motor vehicle dealer may, at retail or wholesale, sell a recreational vehicle as described in s. 320.01(1)(b)1.-6. and 8., acquired in exchange for the sale of a motor vehicle, provided such acquisition is incidental to the principal business of being a motor vehicle dealer. However, a motor vehicle dealer may not buy a recreational vehicle for the purpose of resale unless licensed as a recreational vehicle dealer pursuant to s. 320.771. A motor vehicle dealer may apply for a certificate of title to a motor vehicle required to be registered under s. 320.08(2)(b), (c), and (d), using a manufacturer’s statement of origin as permitted by s. 319.23(1), only if such dealer is authorized by a franchised agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1), to buy, sell, or deal in such vehicle and is authorized by such agreement to perform delivery and preparation obligations and warranty defect adjustments on the motor vehicle; provided this limitation shall not apply to recreational vehicles, van conversions, or any other motor vehicle manufactured on a truck chassis. The transfer of a motor vehicle by a dealer not meeting these qualifications shall be titled as a used vehicle. The classifications of motor vehicle dealers are defined as follows: 1. “Franchised motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages in the business of repairing, servicing, buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles pursuant to an agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1). 2. “Independent motor vehicle dealer” means any person other than a franchised or wholesale motor vehicle dealer who engages in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles, and who may service and repair motor vehicles. 3. “Wholesale motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages exclusively in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles at wholesale or with motor vehicle auctions. Such person shall be licensed to do business in this state, shall not sell or auction a vehicle to any person who is not a licensed dealer, and shall not have the privilege of the use of dealer license plates. Any person who buys, sells, or deals in motor vehicles at wholesale or with motor vehicle auctions on behalf of a licensed motor vehicle dealer and as a bona fide employee of such licensed motor vehicle dealer is not required to be licensed as a wholesale motor vehicle dealer. In such cases it shall be prima facie presumed that a bona fide employer-employee relationship exists. A wholesale motor vehicle dealer shall be exempt from the display provisions of this section but shall maintain an office wherein records are kept in order that those records may be inspected. 4. “Motor vehicle auction” means any person offering motor vehicles or recreational vehicles for sale to the highest bidder where buyers are licensed motor vehicle dealers. Such person shall not sell a vehicle to anyone other than a licensed motor vehicle dealer. 5. “Salvage motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages in the business of acquiring salvaged or wrecked motor vehicles for the purpose of reselling them and their parts. The term “motor vehicle dealer” does not include persons not engaged in the purchase or sale of motor vehicles as a business who are disposing of vehicles acquired for their own use or for use in their business or acquired by foreclosure or by operation of law, provided such vehicles are acquired and sold in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this law; persons engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, or offering or displaying for sale at wholesale or retail no more than 25 trailers in a 12-month period; public officers while performing their official duties; receivers; trustees, administrators, executors, guardians, or other persons appointed by, or acting under the judgment or order of, any court; banks, finance companies, or other loan agencies that acquire motor vehicles as an incident to their regular business; motor vehicle brokers; and motor vehicle rental and leasing companies that sell motor vehicles to motor vehicle dealers licensed under this section. Vehicles owned under circumstances described in this paragraph may be disposed of at retail, wholesale, or auction, unless otherwise restricted. A manufacturer of fire trucks, ambulances, or school buses may sell such vehicles directly to governmental agencies or to persons who contract to perform or provide firefighting, ambulance, or school transportation services exclusively to governmental agencies without processing such sales through dealers if such fire trucks, ambulances, school buses, or similar vehicles are not presently available through motor vehicle dealers licensed by the department. (d) “Motor vehicle broker” means any person engaged in the business of offering to procure or procuring motor vehicles for the general public, or who holds himself or herself out through solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as one who offers to procure or procures motor vehicles for the general public, and who does not store, display, or take ownership of any vehicles for the purpose of selling such vehicles. (e) “Person” means any natural person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation. (f) “Bona fide employee” means a person who is employed by a licensed motor vehicle dealer and receives annually an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, or an independent contractor who has a written contract with a licensed motor vehicle dealer and receives annually an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099, for the purpose of acting in the capacity of or conducting motor vehicle sales transactions as a motor vehicle dealer. (2) LICENSE REQUIRED.—No person shall engage in business as, serve in the capacity of, or act as a motor vehicle dealer in this state without first obtaining a license therefor in the appropriate classification as provided in this section. With the exception of transactions with motor vehicle auctions, no person other than a licensed motor vehicle dealer may advertise for sale any motor vehicle belonging to another party unless as a direct result of a bona fide legal proceeding, court order, settlement of an estate, or by operation of law. However, owners of motor vehicles titled in their names may advertise and offer vehicles for sale on their own behalf. It shall be unlawful for a licensed motor vehicle dealer to allow any person other than a bona fide employee to use the motor vehicle dealer license for the purpose of acting in the capacity of or conducting motor vehicle sales transactions as a motor vehicle dealer. Any person selling or offering a motor vehicle for sale in violation of the licensing requirements of this subsection, or who misrepresents to any person its relationship with any manufacturer, importer, or distributor, in addition to the penalties provided herein, shall be deemed guilty of an unfair and deceptive trade practice as defined in part II of chapter 501 and shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (8) and (9). (3) APPLICATION AND FEE.—The application for the license shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the department and shall be subject to such rules with respect thereto as may be so prescribed by it. Such application shall be verified by oath or affirmation and shall contain a full statement of the name and birth date of the person or persons applying therefor; the name of the firm or copartnership, with the names and places of residence of all members thereof, if such applicant is a firm or copartnership; the names and places of residence of the principal officers, if the applicant is a body corporate or other artificial body; the name of the state under whose laws the corporation is organized; the present and former place or places of residence of the applicant; and prior business in which the applicant has been engaged and the location thereof. Such application shall describe the exact location of the place of business and shall state whether the place of business is owned by the applicant and when acquired, or, if leased, a true copy of the lease shall be attached to the application. The applicant shall certify that the location provides an adequately equipped office and is not a residence; that the location affords sufficient unoccupied space upon and within which adequately to store all motor vehicles offered and displayed for sale; and that the location is a suitable place where the applicant can in good faith carry on such business and keep and maintain books, records, and files necessary to conduct such business, which shall be available at all reasonable hours to inspection by the department or any of its inspectors or other employees. The applicant shall certify that the business of a motor vehicle dealer is the principal business which shall be conducted at that location. The application shall contain a statement that the applicant is either franchised by a manufacturer of motor vehicles, in which case the name of each motor vehicle that the applicant is franchised to sell shall be included, or an independent (nonfranchised) motor vehicle dealer. The application shall contain other relevant information as may be required by the department, including evidence that the applicant is insured under a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy, which shall include, at a minimum, $25,000 combined single-limit liability coverage including bodily injury and property damage protection and $10,000 personal injury protection. However, a salvage motor vehicle dealer as defined in subparagraph (1)(c)5. is exempt from the requirements for garage liability insurance and personal injury protection insurance on those vehicles that cannot be legally operated on roads, highways, or streets in this state. Franchise dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy, and all other dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy. Such policy shall be for the license period, and evidence of a new or continued policy shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. A licensee shall deliver to the department, in the manner prescribed by the department, within 10 calendar days after any renewal or continuation of or change in such policy or within 10 calendar days after any issuance of a new policy, a copy of the renewed, continued, changed, or new policy. Upon making initial application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 in addition to any other fees required by law. Applicants may choose to extend the licensure period for 1 additional year for a total of 2 years. An initial applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 for the first year and $75 for the second year, in addition to any other fees required by law. An applicant for renewal shall pay to the department $75 for a 1-year renewal or $150 for a 2-year renewal, in addition to any other fees required by law. Upon making an application for a change of location, the person shall pay a fee of $50 in addition to any other fees now required by law. The department shall, in the case of every application for initial licensure, verify whether certain facts set forth in the application are true. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a corporate applicant, must file a set of fingerprints with the department for the purpose of determining any prior criminal record or any outstanding warrants. The department shall submit the fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for federal processing. The actual cost of state and federal processing shall be borne by the applicant and is in addition to the fee for licensure. The department may issue a license to an applicant pending the results of the fingerprint investigation, which license is fully revocable if the department subsequently determines that any facts set forth in the application are not true or correctly represented. (4) LICENSE CERTIFICATE.— (a) A license certificate shall be issued by the department in accordance with such application when the application is regular in form and in compliance with the provisions of this section. The license certificate may be in the form of a document or a computerized card as determined by the department. The actual cost of each original, additional, or replacement computerized card shall be borne by the licensee and is in addition to the fee for licensure. Such license, when so issued, entitles the licensee to carry on and conduct the business of a motor vehicle dealer. Each license issued to a franchise motor vehicle dealer expires on December 31 of the year of its expiration unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. Each license issued to an independent or wholesale dealer or auction expires on April 30 of the year of its expiration unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. At least 60 days before the license expiration date, the department shall deliver or mail to each licensee the necessary renewal forms. Each independent dealer shall certify that the dealer (owner, partner, officer, or director of the licensee, or a full-time employee of the licensee that holds a responsible management-level position) has completed 8 hours of continuing education prior to filing the renewal forms with the department. Such certification shall be filed once every 2 years. The continuing education shall include at least 2 hours of legal or legislative issues, 1 hour of department issues, and 5 hours of relevant motor vehicle industry topics. Continuing education shall be provided by dealer schools licensed under paragraph (b) either in a classroom setting or by correspondence. Such schools shall provide certificates of completion to the department and the customer which shall be filed with the license renewal form, and such schools may charge a fee for providing continuing education. Any licensee who does not file his or her application and fees and any other requisite documents, as required by law, with the department at least 30 days prior to the license expiration date shall cease to engage in business as a motor vehicle dealer on the license expiration date. A renewal filed with the department within 45 days after the expiration date shall be accompanied by a delinquent fee of $100. Thereafter, a new application is required, accompanied by the initial license fee. A license certificate duly issued by the department may be modified by endorsement to show a change in the name of the licensee, provided, as shown by affidavit of the licensee, the majority ownership interest of the licensee has not changed or the name of the person appearing as franchisee on the sales and service agreement has not changed. Modification of a license certificate to show any name change as herein provided shall not require initial licensure or reissuance of dealer tags; however, any dealer obtaining a name change shall transact all business in and be properly identified by that name. All documents relative to licensure shall reflect the new name. In the case of a franchise dealer, the name change shall be approved by the manufacturer, distributor, or importer. A licensee applying for a name change endorsement shall pay a fee of $25 which fee shall apply to the change in the name of a main location and all additional locations licensed under the provisions of subsection (5). Each initial license application received by the department shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant, or one or more of his or her designated employees, has attended a training and information seminar conducted by a licensed motor vehicle dealer training school. Any applicant for a new franchised motor vehicle dealer license who has held a valid franchised motor vehicle dealer license continuously for the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing training requirement. Such seminar shall include, but is not limited to, statutory dealer requirements, which requirements include required bookkeeping and recordkeeping procedures, requirements for the collection of sales and use taxes, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. No seminar may exceed 8 hours in length. (b) Each initial license application received by the department for licensure under subparagraph (1)(c)2. shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant (owner, partner, officer, or director of the applicant, or a full-time employee of the applicant that holds a responsible management-level position) has successfully completed training conducted by a licensed motor vehicle dealer training school. Such training must include training in titling and registration of motor vehicles, laws relating to unfair and deceptive trade practices, laws relating to financing with regard to buy-here, pay-here operations, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. Successful completion of this training shall be determined by examination administered at the end of the course and attendance of no less than 90 percent of the total hours required by such school. Any applicant who had held a valid motor vehicle dealer’s license continuously within the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing requirements of this section. The department shall have the authority to adopt any rule necessary for establishing the training curriculum; length of training, which shall not exceed 8 hours for required department topics and shall not exceed an additional 24 hours for topics related to other regulatory agencies’ instructor qualifications; and any other requirements under this section. The curriculum for other subjects shall be approved by any and all other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over specific subject matters; however, the overall administration of the licensing of these dealer schools and their instructors shall remain with the department. Such schools are authorized to charge a fee. (5) SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE.—Any person licensed under this section shall obtain a supplemental license for each permanent additional place or places of business not contiguous to the premises for which the original license is issued, on a form to be furnished by the department, and upon payment of a fee of $50 for each such additional location. Applicants may choose to extend the licensure period for 1 additional year for a total of 2 years. The applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $50 for the first year and $50 for the second year for each such additional location. Thereafter, the applicant shall pay $50 for a 1-year renewal or $100 for a 2-year renewal for each such additional location. A supplemental license authorizing off-premises sales shall be issued, at no charge to the dealer, for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive calendar days. To obtain such a temporary supplemental license for off-premises sales, the applicant must be a licensed dealer; must notify the applicable local department office of the specific dates and location for which such license is requested, display a sign at the licensed location clearly identifying the dealer, and provide staff to work at the temporary location for the duration of the off-premises sale; must meet any local government permitting requirements; and must have permission of the property owner to sell at that location. In the case of an off-premises sale by a motor vehicle dealer licensed under subparagraph (1)(c)1. for the sale of new motor vehicles, the applicant must also include documentation notifying the applicable licensee licensed under s. 320.61 of the intent to engage in an off-premises sale 5 working days prior to the date of the off-premises sale. The licensee shall either approve or disapprove of the off-premises sale within 2 working days after receiving notice; otherwise, it will be deemed approved. This section does not apply to a nonselling motor vehicle show or public display of new motor vehicles. (6) RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY LICENSEE.—Every licensee shall keep a book or record in either paper or electronic form as prescribed or approved by the department for a period of 5 years, in which the licensee shall keep a record of the purchase, sale, or exchange, or receipt for the purpose of sale, of any motor vehicle, the date upon which any temporary tag was issued, the date of title transfer, and a description of such motor vehicle together with the name and address of the seller, the purchaser, and the alleged owner or other person from whom such motor vehicle was purchased or received or to whom it was sold or delivered, as the case may be. Such description shall include the identification or engine number, maker’s number, if any, chassis number, if any, and such other numbers or identification marks as may be thereon and shall also include a statement that a number has been obliterated, defaced, or changed, if such is the fact. When a licensee chooses to maintain electronic records, the original paper documents may be destroyed after the licensee successfully transfers title and registration to the purchaser as required by chapter 319 for any purchaser who titles and registers the motor vehicle in this state. In the case of a sale to a purchaser who will title and register the motor vehicle in another state or country, the licensee may destroy the original paper documents after successfully delivering a lawfully reassigned title or manufacturer’s certificate or statement of origin to the purchaser and after producing electronic images of all documents related to the sale. (7) CERTIFICATE OF TITLE REQUIRED.—For each used motor vehicle in the possession of a licensee and offered for sale by him or her, the licensee either shall have in his or her possession or control a duly assigned certificate of title from the owner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319, from the time when the motor vehicle is delivered to the licensee and offered for sale by him or her until it has been disposed of by the licensee, or shall have reasonable indicia of ownership or right of possession, or shall have made proper application for a certificate of title or duplicate certificate of title in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319. A motor vehicle dealer may not sell or offer for sale a vehicle in his or her possession unless the dealer satisfies the requirements of this subsection. Reasonable indicia of ownership shall include a duly assigned certificate of title; in the case of a new motor vehicle, a manufacturer’s certificate of origin issued to or reassigned to the dealer; a consignment contract between the owner and the dealer along with a secure power of attorney from the owner to the dealer authorizing the dealer to apply for a duplicate certificate of title and assign the title on behalf of the owner; a court order awarding title to the vehicle to the dealer; a salvage certificate of title; a photocopy of a duly assigned certificate of title being held by a financial institution as collateral for a business loan of money to the dealer (“floor plan”); a copy of a canceled check or other documentation evidencing that an outstanding lien on a vehicle taken in trade by a licensed dealer has been satisfied and that the certificate of title will be, but has not yet been, received by the dealer; a vehicle purchase order or installment contract for a specific vehicle identifying that vehicle as a trade-in on a replacement vehicle; or a duly executed odometer disclosure statement as required by Title IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (Pub. L. No. 92-513, as amended by Pub. L. No. 94-364 and Pub. L. No. 100-561) and by 49 C.F.R. part 580 bearing the signatures of the titled owners of a traded-in vehicle. (8) PENALTY.—Any person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (9) DENIAL, SUSPENSION, OR REVOCATION.— (a) The department may deny, suspend, or revoke any license issued hereunder or under the provisions of s. 320.77 or s. 320.771 upon proof that an applicant or a licensee has: 1. Committed fraud or willful misrepresentation in application for or in obtaining a license. 2. Been convicted of a felony. 3. Failed to honor a bank draft or check given to a motor vehicle dealer for the purchase of a motor vehicle by another motor vehicle dealer within 10 days after notification that the bank draft or check has been dishonored. If the transaction is disputed, the maker of the bank draft or check shall post a bond in accordance with the provisions of s. 559.917, and no proceeding for revocation or suspension shall be commenced until the dispute is resolved. 4.a. Failed to provide payment within 10 business days to the department for a check payable to the department that was dishonored due to insufficient funds in the amount due plus any statutorily authorized fee for uttering a worthless check. The department shall notify an applicant or licensee when the applicant or licensee makes payment to the department by a check that is subsequently dishonored by the bank due to insufficient funds. The applicant or licensee shall, within 10 business days after receiving the notice, provide payment to the department in the form of cash in the amount due plus any statutorily authorized fee. If the applicant or licensee fails to make such payment within 10 business days, the department may deny, suspend, or revoke the applicant’s or licensee’s motor vehicle dealer license. b. Stopped payment on a check payable to the department, issued a check payable to the department from an account that has been closed, or charged back a credit card transaction to the department. If an applicant or licensee commits any such act, the department may deny, suspend, or revoke the applicant’s or licensee’s motor vehicle dealer license. (b) The department may deny, suspend, or revoke any license issued hereunder or under the provisions of s. 320.77 or s. 320.771 upon proof that a licensee has committed, with sufficient frequency so as to establish a pattern of wrongdoing on the part of a licensee, violations of one or more of the following activities: 1. Representation that a demonstrator is a new motor vehicle, or the attempt to sell or the sale of a demonstrator as a new motor vehicle without written notice to the purchaser that the vehicle is a demonstrator. For the purposes of this section, a “demonstrator,” a “new motor vehicle,” and a “used motor vehicle” shall be defined as under s. 320.60. 2. Unjustifiable refusal to comply with a licensee’s responsibility under the terms of the new motor vehicle warranty issued by its respective manufacturer, distributor, or importer. However, if such refusal is at the direction of the manufacturer, distributor, or importer, such refusal shall not be a ground under this section. 3. Misrepresentation or false, deceptive, or misleading statements with regard to the sale or financing of motor vehicles which any motor vehicle dealer has, or causes to have, advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed, broadcast, televised, or made in any manner with regard to the sale or financing of motor vehicles. 4. Failure by any motor vehicle dealer to provide a customer or purchaser with an odometer disclosure statement and a copy of any bona fide written, executed sales contract or agreement of purchase connected with the purchase of the motor vehicle purchased by the customer or purchaser. 5. Failure of any motor vehicle dealer to comply with the terms of any bona fide written, executed agreement, pursuant to the sale of a motor vehicle. 6. Failure to apply for transfer of a title as prescribed in s. 319.23(6). 7. Use of the dealer license identification number by any person other than the licensed dealer or his or her designee. 8. Failure to continually meet the requirements of the licensure law. 9.

Failure to maintain evidence of notification to the owner or co-owner of a vehicle regarding registration or titling fees owed as required in s. 320.02(18). 19. Failure to register a mobile home salesperson with the department as required by this section. (c) When a motor vehicle dealer is convicted of a crime which results in his or her being prohibited from continuing in that capacity, the dealer may not continue in any capacity within the industry. The offender shall have no financial interest, management, sales, or other role in the operation of a dealership. Further, the offender may not derive income from the dealership beyond reasonable compensation for the sale of his or her ownership interest in the business. (10) SURETY BOND OR IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT REQUIRED.— (a) Annually, before any license shall be issued to a motor vehicle dealer, the applicant-dealer of new or used motor vehicles shall deliver to the department a good and sufficient surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit, executed by the applicant-dealer as principal, in the sum of $25,000. A licensee shall deliver to the department, in the manner prescribed by the department, within 10 calendar days after any renewal or continuation of or change in such surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit or within 10 calendar days after any issuance of a new surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit, a copy of such renewed, continued, changed, or new surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit. (b) Surety bonds and irrevocable letters of credit shall be in a form to be approved by the department and shall be conditioned that the motor vehicle dealer shall comply with the conditions of any written contract made by such dealer in connection with the sale or exchange of any motor vehicle and shall not violate any of the provisions of chapter 319 and this chapter in the conduct of the business for which the dealer is licensed. Such bonds and letters of credit shall be to the department and in favor of any person in a retail or wholesale transaction who shall suffer any loss as a result of any violation of the conditions hereinabove contained. When the department determines that a person has incurred a loss as a result of a violation of chapter 319 or this chapter, it shall notify the person in writing of the existence of the bond or letter of credit. Such bonds and letters of credit shall be for the license period, and a new bond or letter of credit or a proper continuation certificate shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. However, the aggregate liability of the surety in any one year shall in no event exceed the sum of the bond or, in the case of a letter of credit, the aggregate liability of the issuing bank shall not exceed the sum of the credit. (c) Surety bonds shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state as surety, and irrevocable letters of credit shall be issued by a bank authorized to do business in the state as a bank. (d) Irrevocable letters of credit shall be engaged by a bank as an agreement to honor demands for payment as specified in this section. (e) The department shall, upon denial, suspension, or revocation of any license, notify the surety company of the licensee, or bank issuing an irrevocable letter of credit for the licensee, in writing, that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked and shall state the reason for such denial, suspension, or revocation. (f) Any surety company which pays any claim against the bond of any licensee or any bank which honors a demand for payment as a condition specified in a letter of credit of a licensee shall notify the department in writing that such action has been taken and shall state the amount of the claim or payment. (g) Any surety company which cancels the bond of any licensee or any bank which cancels an irrevocable letter of credit shall notify the department in writing of such cancellation, giving reason for the cancellation. (11) INJUNCTION.—In addition to the remedies provided in this chapter and notwithstanding the existence of any adequate remedy at law, the department is authorized to make application to any circuit court of the state, and such circuit court shall have jurisdiction, upon a hearing and for cause shown, to grant a temporary or permanent injunction, or both, restraining any person from acting as a motor vehicle dealer under the terms of this section without being properly licensed hereunder, from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of chapter 319, this chapter, or ss. 559.901-559.9221, or for failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of chapter 319, this chapter, or ss. 559.901-559.9221, or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder, such injunction to be issued without bond. A single act in violation of the provisions of chapter 319, this chapter, or chapter 559 shall be sufficient to authorize the issuance of an injunction. (12) CIVIL FINES; PROCEDURE.—In addition to the exercise of other powers provided in this section, the department may levy and collect a civil fine, in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, against any licensee if it finds that the licensee has violated any provision of this section or has violated any other law of this state or the federal law and administrative rule set forth in paragraph (9)(a) related to dealing in motor vehicles. Any licensee shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to chapter 120 if the licensee contests the fine levied, or about to be levied, upon him or her.

In the absence of a breach by the selling dealer of its dealer agreement or this chapter, the manufacturer or distributor shall not object to the proposed change in ownership unless the prospective transferee: (a) Has previously been terminated by the manufacturer for breach of its dealer agreement; (b) Has been convicted of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude; (c) Lacks any license required by law; (d) Does not have an active line of credit sufficient to purchase a manufacturer’s product; or (e) Has undergone in the last 10 years bankruptcy, insolvency, a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or conservator to take possession of the transferee’s business or property. (2) If the manufacturer or distributor objects to a proposed change of ownership, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within 7 business days after receipt of the dealer’s notification and complete documentation. The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof with regard to its objection. If the manufacturer or distributor does not give timely notice of its objection, the change or sale shall be deemed approved. (3)(a) It is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to fail to provide a dealer an opportunity to designate, in writing, a family member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the death, incapacity, or retirement of the dealer. It is unlawful to prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a dealership by a family member of the deceased, incapacitated, or retired dealer unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided to the dealer written notice of its objections within 10 days after receipt of the dealer’s modification of the dealer’s succession plan. In the absence of a breach of the dealer agreement, the manufacturer may object to the succession for the following reasons only: 1. Conviction of the successor of a felony or any crime of fraud, deceit, or moral turpitude; 2. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the successor during the past 10 years; 3. Prior termination by the manufacturer of the successor for breach of a dealer agreement; 4. The lack of an active line of credit for the successor sufficient to purchase the manufacturer’s product; or 5. The lack of any license for the successor required by law. (b) The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof regarding its objection. However, a family member may not succeed to a dealership if the succession involves, without the manufacturer’s or distributor’s consent, a relocation of the business or an alteration of the terms and conditions of the manufacturer/dealer agreement.

The schedule of compensation must include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work as well as warranty labor. (2) Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty labor must be reasonable for the work to be performed. The compensation of a dealer for warranty labor may not be less than the lowest retail labor rates actually charged by the dealer for like nonwarranty labor as long as such rates are reasonable. (3) The warrantor shall reimburse the dealer for warranty parts at actual wholesale cost plus a minimum 30-percent handling charge and the cost, if any, of freight to return warranty parts to the warrantor. (4) Warranty audits of dealer records may be conducted by the warrantor on a reasonable basis, and dealer claims for warranty compensation may not be denied except for cause, such as performance of nonwarranty repairs, material noncompliance with the warrantor’s published policies and procedures, lack of material documentation, fraud, or misrepresentation. (5) The dealer shall submit warranty claims within 45 days after completing work. (6) The dealer shall notify the warrantor verbally or in writing if the dealer is unable to perform material or repetitive warranty repairs as soon as is reasonably possible. (7) The warrantor shall disapprove warranty claims in writing within 45 days after the date of submission by the dealer in the manner and form prescribed by the warrantor. Claims not specifically disapproved in writing within 45 days shall be construed to be approved and must be paid within 60 days. (8) It is a violation of ss. 320.3201-320.3211 for any warrantor to: (a) Fail to perform any of its warranty obligations with respect to its warranted products; (b) Fail to include, in written notices of factory campaigns to recreational vehicle owners and dealers, the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment, including tires and chassis or chassis parts, will be available to dealers to perform the campaign work. The warrantor may ship parts to the dealer to effect the campaign work, and, if such parts are in excess of the dealer’s requirements, the dealer may return unused parts to the warrantor for credit after completion of the campaign; (c) Fail to compensate any of its dealers for authorized repairs effected by the dealer of merchandise damaged in manufacture or transit to the dealer, if the carrier is designated by the warrantor, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch; (d) Fail to compensate any of its dealers for authorized warranty service in accordance with the schedule of compensation provided to the dealer pursuant to this section if performed in a timely and competent manner; (e) Intentionally misrepresent in any way to purchasers of recreational vehicles that warranties with respect to the manufacture, performance, or design of the vehicle are made by the dealer as warrantor or cowarrantor; or (f) Require the dealer to make warranties to customers in any manner related to the manufacture of the recreational vehicle. (9) It is a violation of ss. 320.3201-320.3211 for any dealer to: (a) Fail to perform predelivery inspection functions, as specified by the warrantor, in a competent and timely manner; (b) Fail to perform warranty service work authorized by the warrantor in a reasonably competent and timely manner on any transient customer’s vehicle of the same line-make; or (c) Misrepresent the terms of any warranty. (10) Notwithstanding the terms of any manufacturer/dealer agreement, it is a violation of ss. 320.3201-320.3211 for: (a) A warrantor to fail to indemnify and hold harmless its dealer against any losses or damages to the extent such losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the warrantor. The dealer may not be denied indemnification for failing to discover, disclose, or remedy a defect in the design or manufacturing of the recreational vehicle. The dealer shall provide to the warrantor a copy of any suit in which allegations are made that come within this subsection within 10 days after receiving such suit. (b) A dealer to fail to indemnify and hold harmless its warrantor against any losses or damages to the extent such losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the dealer. The warrantor shall provide to the dealer a copy of any suit in which allegations are made that come within this subsection within 10 days after receiving such suit. History.—s. 6, ch. 2007-258.

(3) The timeframe for inspection and rejection by the dealer must be part of the manufacturer/dealer agreement and may not be less than 2 business days after the physical delivery of the recreational vehicle. (4) Any recreational vehicle that has, at the time of delivery to the dealer, an unreasonable amount of miles on its odometer, as determined by the dealer, may be subject to rejection by the dealer and reversion of the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor. In no instance shall a dealer deem an amount less than the distance between the dealer and the manufacturer’s factory or a distributor’s point of distribution, plus 100 miles, as unreasonable.

The court shall award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in such action. Venue for any civil action authorized by this section must exclusively be in the county in which the dealership is located. In an action involving more than one dealer, venue may be in any county in which a dealer who is party to the action is located. (2) Before bringing suit under this section, the party bringing suit for an alleged violation shall serve a written demand for mediation upon the offending party. (a) The demand for mediation shall be served upon the offending party via certified mail at the address stated within the agreement between the parties. In the event of a civil action between two dealers, the demand must be mailed to the address on the dealer’s license filed with the department. (b) The demand for mediation must contain a brief statement of the dispute and the relief sought by the party filing the demand. (c) Within 20 days after the date a demand for mediation is served, the parties shall mutually select an independent certified mediator and meet with the mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. The meeting place must be in this state in a location selected by the mediator. The mediator may extend the date of the meeting for good cause shown by either party or upon stipulation of both parties. (d) The service of a demand for mediation under this subsection stays the time for the filing of any complaint, petition, protest, or action under ss. 320.3201-320.3211 until representatives of both parties have met with a mutually selected mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If a complaint, petition, protest, or action is filed before that meeting, the court shall enter an order suspending the proceeding or action until the meeting has occurred and may, upon written stipulation of all parties to the proceeding or action that they wish to continue to mediate under this subsection, enter an order suspending the proceeding or action for as long a period as the court considers appropriate. A suspension order issued under this paragraph may be revoked by the court. (e) The parties to the mediation shall bear their own costs for attorney’s fees and divide equally the cost of the mediator. (3) In addition to the remedies provided in this section and notwithstanding the existence of any additional remedy at law, a dealer or manufacturer may apply to a circuit court for the grant, upon a hearing and for cause shown, of a temporary or permanent injunction, or both, restraining any person from acting as a dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or importer without being properly licensed pursuant to this chapter, from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of ss. 320.3201-320.3211, or from failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of ss. 320.3201-320.3211.

The purpose of such written statement is to provide notice to the motor vehicle dealer that the vehicle may be sold or delivered based solely on the specific recall notice and is not intended to address any other aspect of the vehicle unrelated to the recall notice. (2) The licensee shall pay the required compensation within 30 days after the motor vehicle dealer’s application for payment. Applications for payment must be submitted monthly, as necessary, through the licensee’s existing warranty application system or another system or process established by the licensee which is not unduly burdensome or which does not require information unnecessary for the payment. (3) Compensation under this section must be the greater of: (a) Payment at a rate of at least 1.5 percent per month of the motor vehicle value, as determined by the average Black Book value of the corresponding model year vehicle of average condition, of each eligible used motor vehicle in the motor vehicle dealer’s inventory for each month that the dealer does not receive a remedy and parts to complete the required recall repair. Such payment must be prorated for any period less than 1 month based on the number of days during the month each eligible used motor vehicle is in the motor vehicle dealer’s inventory. Payment shall be calculated from the 31st day after the recall was issued, the 31st day after the vehicle was acquired, or July 1, 2017, whichever is latest. (b) Payment under a national program applicable to all motor vehicle dealers holding a franchise agreement with the licensee for the motor vehicle dealer’s costs associated with holding the eligible used motor vehicles. (4) For purposes of this section, a licensee does not include a motorcycle manufacturer, distributor, or importer. History.—s. 2, ch. 2017-141.

      "text": "320.642 Dealer licenses in areas previously served; procedure.— (1) Any licensee who proposes to establish an additional motor vehicle dealership or permit the relocation of an existing dealer to a location within a community or territory where the same line-make vehicle is presently represented by a franchised motor vehicle dealer or dealers shall give written notice of its intention to the department. The notice must state: (a) The specific location at which the additional or relocated motor vehicle dealership will be established. (b) The date on or after which the licensee intends to be engaged in business with the additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer at the proposed location. (c) The identity of all motor vehicle dealers who are franchised to sell the same line-make vehicle with licensed locations in the county and any contiguous county to the county where the additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer is proposed to be located. (d) The names and addresses of the dealer-operator and principal investors in the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealership. Immediately upon receipt of the notice the department shall cause a notice to be published in the Florida Administrative Register. The published notice must state that a petition or complaint by any dealer with standing to protest pursuant to subsection (3) must be filed within 30 days following the date of publication of the notice in the Florida Administrative Register. The published notice must describe and identify the proposed dealership sought to be licensed, and the department shall cause a copy of the notice to be mailed to those dealers identified in the licensee’s notice under paragraph (c). The licensee shall pay a fee of $75 and a service charge of $2.50 for each publication. Proceeds from the fee and service charge shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. (2)(a) An application for a motor vehicle dealer license in any community or territory shall be denied when: 1. A timely protest is filed by a presently existing franchised motor vehicle dealer with standing to protest as defined in subsection (3); and 2. The licensee fails to show that the existing franchised dealer or dealers who register new motor vehicle retail sales or retail leases of the same line-make in the community or territory of the proposed dealership are not providing adequate representation of such line-make motor vehicles in such community or territory. The burden of proof in establishing inadequate representation shall be on the licensee. (b) In determining whether the existing franchised motor vehicle dealer or dealers are providing adequate representation in the community or territory for the line-make, the department may consider evidence which may include, but is not limited to: 1. The impact of the establishment of the proposed or relocated dealer on the consumers, public interest, existing dealers, and the licensee; provided, however, that financial impact may only be considered with respect to the protesting dealer or dealers. 2. The size and permanency of investment reasonably made and reasonable obligations incurred by the existing dealer or dealers to perform their obligations under the dealer agreement. 3. The reasonably expected market penetration of the line-make motor vehicle for the community or territory involved, after consideration of all factors which may affect said penetration, including, but not limited to, demographic factors such as age, income, education, size class preference, product popularity, retail lease transactions, or other factors affecting sales to consumers of the community or territory. 4. Any actions by the licensees in denying its existing dealer or dealers of the same line-make the opportunity for reasonable growth, market expansion, or relocation, including the availability of line-make vehicles in keeping with the reasonable expectations of the licensee in providing an adequate number of dealers in the community or territory. 5. Any attempts by the licensee to coerce the existing dealer or dealers into consenting to additional or relocated franchises of the same line-make in the community or territory. 6. Distance, travel time, traffic patterns, and accessibility between the existing dealer or dealers of the same line-make and the location of the proposed additional or relocated dealer. 7. Whether benefits to consumers will likely occur from the establishment or relocation of the dealership which cannot be obtained by other geographic or demographic changes or expected changes in the community or territory. 8. Whether the protesting dealer or dealers are in substantial compliance with their dealer agreement. 9. Whether there is adequate interbrand and intrabrand competition with respect to said line-make in the community or territory and adequately convenient consumer care for the motor vehicles of the line-make, including the adequacy of sales and service facilities. 10. Whether the establishment or relocation of the proposed dealership appears to be warranted and justified based on economic and marketing conditions pertinent to dealers competing in the community or territory, including anticipated future changes. 11. The volume of registrations and service business transacted by the existing dealer or dealers of the same line-make in the relevant community or territory of the proposed dealership. (3) An existing franchised motor vehicle dealer or dealers shall have standing to protest a proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer when the existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers have a franchise agreement for the same line-make vehicle to be sold or serviced by the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer and are physically located so as to meet or satisfy any of the following requirements or conditions: (a) If the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer is to be located in a county with a population of less than 300,000 according to the most recent data of the United States Census Bureau or the data of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research of the University of Florida: 1. The proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer is to be located in the area designated or described as the area of responsibility, or such similarly designated area, including the entire area designated as a multiple-point area, in the franchise agreement or in any related document or commitment with the existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers of the same line-make as such agreement existed upon October 1, 1988; 2. The existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers of the same line-make have a licensed franchise location within a radius of 20 miles of the location of the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer; or 3. Any existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers of the same line-make can establish that during any 12-month period of the 36-month period preceding the filing of the licensee’s application for the proposed dealership, the dealer or its predecessor made 25 percent of its retail sales of new motor vehicles to persons whose registered household addresses were located within a radius of 20 miles of the location of the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer; provided the existing dealer is located in the same county or any county contiguous to the county where the additional or relocated dealer is proposed to be located. (b) If the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer is to be located in a county with a population of more than 300,000 according to the most recent data of the United States Census Bureau or the data of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research of the University of Florida: 1. Any existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers of the same line-make have a licensed franchise location within a radius of 12.5 miles of the location of the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer; or 2. Any existing motor vehicle dealer or dealers of the same line-make can establish that during any 12-month period of the 36-month period preceding the filing of the licensee’s application for the proposed dealership, such dealer or its predecessor made 25 percent of its retail sales of new motor vehicles to persons whose registered household addresses were located within a radius of 12.5 miles of the location of the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer; provided such existing dealer is located in the same county or any county contiguous to the county where the additional or relocated dealer is proposed to be located. (4) The department’s decision to deny issuance of a license under this section shall remain in effect for a period of 12 months. The department shall not issue a license for the proposed additional or relocated motor vehicle dealer until a final decision by the department is rendered determining that the application for the motor vehicle dealer’s license should be granted. (5)(a) The opening or reopening of the same or a successor motor vehicle dealer within 12 months is not considered an additional motor vehicle dealer subject to protest within the meaning of this section, if: 1. The opening or reopening is within the same or an adjacent county and is within 2 miles of the former motor vehicle dealer location; 2. There is no dealer within 25 miles of the proposed location or the proposed location is further from each existing dealer of the same line-make than the prior location is from each dealer of the same line-make within 25 miles of the new location; 3. The opening or reopening is within 6 miles of the prior location and, if any existing motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make is located within 15 miles of the former location, the proposed location is no closer to any existing dealer of the same line-make within 15 miles of the proposed location; or 4. The opening or reopening is within 6 miles of the prior location and, if all existing motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make are beyond 15 miles of the former location, the proposed location is further than 15 miles from any existing motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make. (b) Any other such opening or reopening shall constitute an additional motor vehicle dealer within the meaning of this section. (c) If a motor vehicle dealer has been opened or reopened pursuant to this subsection, the licensee may not propose a motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make to be located within 4 miles of the previous location of such dealer for 2 years after the date the relocated dealership opens. (6) When a proposed addition or relocation concerns a dealership that performs or is to perform only service, as defined in s. 320.60, and will not or does not sell or lease, as defined in s. 320.60, new motor vehicles, the proposal shall be subject to notice and protest pursuant to the provisions of this section. (a) Standing to protest the addition or relocation of a service-only dealership shall be limited to those instances in which the applicable mileage requirement established in subparagraphs (3)(a)2. and (3)(b)1. is met. (b) The addition or relocation of a service-only dealership shall not be subject to protest if: 1. The applicant for the service-only dealership location is an existing motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make as the proposed additional or relocated service-only dealership; 2. There is no existing dealer of the same line-make closer than the applicant to the proposed location of the additional or relocated service-only dealership; and 3. The proposed location of the additional or relocated service-only dealership is at least 7 miles from all existing motor vehicle dealerships of the same line-make, other than motor vehicle dealerships owned by the applicant. (c) In determining whether existing franchised motor vehicle dealers are providing adequate representations in the community or territory for the line-make in question in a protest of the proposed addition or relocation of a service-only dealership, the department may consider the elements set forth in paragraph (2)(b), provided: 1. With respect to subparagraph (2)(b)1., only the impact as it relates to service may be considered; 2. Subparagraph (2)(b)3. shall not be considered; 3. With respect to subparagraph (2)(b)9., only service facilities shall be considered; and 4. With respect to subparagraph (2)(b)11., only the volume of service business transacted shall be considered. (d) If an application for a service-only dealership is granted, the department must issue a license which permits only service, as defined in s. 320.60, and does not permit the selling or leasing, as defined in s. 320.60, of new motor vehicles. If a service-only dealership subsequently seeks to sell new motor vehicles at its location, the notice and protest provisions of this section shall apply. (7) Measurements of the distance between proposed or existing dealer locations required by this section shall be taken from the geometric centroid of the property that encompasses all of the existing or proposed motor vehicle dealer operations. (8) The department shall not be obligated to determine the accuracy of any distance asserted by any party in a notice submitted to it. Any dispute concerning a distance measurement asserted by a party shall be resolved by a hearing conducted in accordance with ss. 120.569 and 120.57.

      "text": "320.645 Restriction upon ownership of dealership by licensee.— (1) A licensee, a manufacturer, an importer, or a distributor, or an agent of the licensee, manufacturer, importer, or distributor, or a parent, a subsidiary, a common entity, an officer, or an employed representative of the licensee, manufacturer, importer, or distributor, may not directly or indirectly own, operate, or control, by contract, agreement, or otherwise, a motor vehicle dealership for any line-make in this state if the licensee, manufacturer, importer, or distributor has manufactured, imported, or distributed motor vehicles of any line-make which have been or are offered for sale under a franchise agreement in this state with an independent person. Any person who is not prohibited by this section from owning, operating, or controlling a motor vehicle dealership may be issued a license pursuant to s. 320.27. Any person prohibited by this section from owning, operating, or controlling a motor vehicle dealership may not be issued a motor vehicle dealer license pursuant to s. 320.27. However, a licensee subject to the prohibition in this section is not deemed to be in violation of this section: (a) When operating a motor vehicle dealership for a temporary period, not to exceed 1 year, during the transition from one owner of the motor vehicle dealership to another; (b) When operating a motor vehicle dealership temporarily for a reasonable period for the exclusive purpose of broadening the diversity of its dealer body and enhancing opportunities for qualified persons who are part of a group that has historically been underrepresented in its dealer body, or for other qualified persons who the licensee deems lack the resources to purchase or capitalize the dealership outright, in a bona fide relationship with an independent person, other than a licensee or its agent or affiliate, who has made a significant investment that is subject to loss in the dealership within the dealership’s first year of operation and who can reasonably expect to acquire full ownership of the dealership on reasonable terms and conditions; or (c) If the department determines, after a hearing on the matter, pursuant to chapter 120, at the request of any person, that there is no independent person available in the community or territory to own and operate the motor vehicle dealership in a manner consistent with the public interest. This paragraph applies only if the motor vehicle dealership at issue sells motor vehicles of a line-make that, at the time of the hearing, is offered for sale by at least one other existing motor vehicle dealership not owned, operated, or controlled by the licensee; an officer or employed representative of the licensee; a parent, subsidiary, or common entity of the licensee; or a manufacturer, an importer, or a distributor. In the case of a dealership owned or operated pursuant to paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c), the dealership must be continually made available for sale to an independent person at a fair and reasonable price. Approval of the sale of such a motor vehicle dealership to a proposed motor vehicle dealer shall not be unreasonably withheld. (2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Reasonable terms and conditions” requires that profits from the dealership are reasonably expected to be sufficient to allow full ownership of the dealership by the independent person within a reasonable time period not to exceed 10 years, which time period may be extended if there is a reasonable basis to do so and is not being sought to evade the purpose of this section; that the independent person has sufficient control to permit acquisition of ownership; and that the relationship cannot be terminated solely to avoid full ownership. The terms and conditions are not reasonable if they preclude the independent person from an expedited purchase of the dealership using a monetary source other than profits from the dealership’s operation; provided, however, that the independent person must pay or make an agreement to pay to the licensee any and all reasonable prepayment charges and costs, including all unrecouped restored losses, associated with the expedited purchase of the dealership. For the purpose of this section, unrecouped restored losses are moneys that the manufacturer has provided to the dealership to restore losses of the dealership that the manufacturer has not been paid back through profits of the dealership. (b) “Significant investment” means a reasonable amount, considering the reasonable capital requirements of the dealership, acquired and obtained from sources other than the licensee or any of its affiliates and not encumbered by the person’s interest in the dealership. (3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on: (a) The business activities, including, without limitation, the dealings with motor vehicle manufacturers and their representatives and affiliates, of any person that is primarily engaged in the business of short-term not to exceed 12 months rental of motor vehicles and industrial and construction equipment and activities incidental to that business, provided that: 1. Any motor vehicles sold by such person are limited to used motor vehicles that have been previously used exclusively and regularly by such person in the conduct of its rental business and used motor vehicles traded in on motor vehicles sold by such person; 2. Warranty repairs performed under any manufacturer’s new vehicle warranty by such person on motor vehicles are limited to those motor vehicles that it owns. As to previously owned vehicles, warranty repairs can be performed only if pursuant to a motor vehicle service agreement as defined in part I of chapter 634, issued by such person or an express warranty issued by such person on the retail sale of those vehicles previously owned; and 3. Motor vehicle financing provided by such person to retail consumers for motor vehicles is limited to used motor vehicles sold by such person in the conduct of its business; or (b) The direct or indirect ownership, affiliation or control of a person described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (4) This chapter does not prohibit a distributor as defined in s. 320.60 or an affiliate thereof which is not a manufacturer or an importer, a division of a manufacturer or an importer, an entity that is controlled by a manufacturer or an importer, or a common entity of a manufacturer or an importer, and which is not owned, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a manufacturer or an importer, as defined in s. 320.60, from receiving a license or licenses as defined in s. 320.27 and owning and operating a motor vehicle dealership or dealerships that sell or service motor vehicles other than any line-make of motor vehicles distributed by the distributor.

      "text": "320.646 Consumer data protection.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Consumer data” means “nonpublic personal information” as such term is defined in 15 U.S.C. s. 6809(4) collected by a motor vehicle dealer and which is provided by the motor vehicle dealer directly to a licensee or third party acting on behalf of a licensee. Consumer data does not include the same or similar data which is obtained by a licensee from any other source. (b) “Data management system” means a computer hardware or software system that is owned, leased, or licensed by a motor vehicle dealer, including a system of web-based applications, computer software, or computer hardware, whether located at the motor vehicle dealership or hosted remotely, and that stores and provides access to consumer data collected or stored by a motor vehicle dealer. The term includes, but is not limited to, dealership management systems and customer relations management systems. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of any franchise agreement, with respect to consumer data a licensee or a third party acting on behalf of a licensee: (a) Shall comply with all, and not knowingly cause a motor vehicle dealer to violate any, applicable restrictions on reuse or disclosure of the consumer data established by federal or state law and must provide a written statement to the motor vehicle dealer upon request describing the established procedures adopted by the licensee or third party acting on behalf of the licensee which meet or exceed any federal or state requirements to safeguard the consumer data, including, but not limited to, those established in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. ss. 6801 et seq. (b) Shall, upon the written request of the motor vehicle dealer, provide a written list of the consumer data obtained from the motor vehicle dealer and all persons to whom any consumer data has been provided by the licensee or a third party acting on behalf of a licensee during the preceding 6 months. The dealer may make such a request no more than once every 6 months. The list must indicate the specific fields of consumer data which were provided to each person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such a list need not include: 1. A person to whom consumer data was provided, or the specific consumer data provided to such person, if the person was, at the time the consumer data was provided, one of the licensee’s service providers, subcontractors or consultants acting in the course of such person’s performance of services on behalf of or for the benefit of the licensee or motor vehicle dealer, provided that the licensee has entered into an agreement with such person requiring that the person comply with the safeguard requirements of applicable state and federal law, including, but not limited to, those established in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. ss. 6801 et seq.; or 2. A person to whom consumer data was provided, or the specific consumer data provided to such person, if the motor vehicle dealer has previously consented in writing to such person receiving the consumer data provided and the motor vehicle dealer has not withdrawn such consent in writing. (c) May not require that a motor vehicle dealer grant the licensee or a third party direct or indirect access to the dealer’s data management system to obtain consumer data. A licensee must permit a motor vehicle dealer to furnish consumer data in a widely accepted file format, such as comma delimited, and through a third-party vendor selected by the motor vehicle dealer. However, a licensee may access or obtain consumer data directly from a motor vehicle dealer’s data management system with the express consent of the dealer. The consent must be in the form of a written document that is separate from the parties’ franchise agreement, is executed by the motor vehicle dealer, and may be withdrawn by the dealer upon 30 days’ written notice to the licensee. (d) Must indemnify the motor vehicle dealer for any third-party claims asserted against or damages incurred by the motor vehicle dealer to the extent caused by access to, use of, or disclosure of consumer data in violation of this section by the licensee, a third party acting on behalf of the licensee, or a third party to whom the licensee has provided consumer data. (3) In any cause of action against a licensee pursuant to s. 320.697 for a violation of paragraph (2)(a), paragraph (2)(b), or paragraph (2)(c), the person bringing the action has the burden of proving that the violation was willful or with sufficient frequency to establish a pattern of wrongdoing with respect to such person’s consumer data.

      "text": "320.696 Warranty responsibility.— (1)(a) A licensee shall timely compensate a motor vehicle dealer who performs work to maintain or repair a licensee’s product under a warranty or maintenance plan, extended warranty, certified pre-owned warranty, or a service contract, issued by the licensee or its common entity, unless issued by a common entity that is not a manufacturer; to fulfill a licensee’s delivery or preparation procedures; or to repair a motor vehicle as a result of a licensee’s or common entity’s recall, campaign service, authorized goodwill, directive, or bulletin. (b) As used in this section, the terms “compensate” and “compensation” shall include all labor and parts included in the work as provided in this section. The term “labor” shall include time spent by employees for diagnosis and repair of a vehicle. The term “parts” shall include replacement parts and accessories. The term “retail customer repair” means work, including parts and labor, performed by a dealer which does not come within the provisions of a licensee’s or its common entity’s warranty, extended warranty, certified pre-owned warranty, service contract, or maintenance plan, and excludes parts and labor described in paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(c). (c) Compensation not paid to a motor vehicle dealer within 30 days after receipt of a claim is not timely. A licensee shall not establish or implement a term, policy, or procedure different from those described in this section for any motor vehicle dealer to obtain compensation under this section, and shall not pay a motor vehicle dealer less than amounts due pursuant to this section. (2) A licensee shall not take or threaten to take adverse action against a motor vehicle dealer who seeks to obtain compensation pursuant to this section. As used in this subsection, the term “adverse action” includes, without limitation, acting or failing to act, other than in good faith; creating or implementing an obstacle or process that is inconsistent with the licensee’s obligations to the dealer under this section; hindering, delaying, or rejecting the proper and timely payment of compensation due under this section to a dealer; establishing, implementing, enforcing, or applying any policy, standard, rule, program, or incentive regarding compensation due under this section other than in a uniform and nondisparate manner among the licensee’s dealers in this state; conducting or threatening to conduct any warranty, retail customer repair, or other service-related audit more frequently than once each calendar year; or denying, reducing, or charging back a warranty claim because of a dealer’s failure to comply with all of the licensee’s requirements for describing or processing a claim. (3)(a) A licensee shall compensate a motor vehicle dealer for parts used in any work described in subsection (1). The compensation may be an agreed percentage markup over the licensee’s dealer cost, but if an agreement is not reached within 30 days after a dealer’s written request, compensation for the parts is the greater of: 1. The dealer’s arithmetical mean percentage markup over dealer cost for all parts charged by the dealer in 50 consecutive retail customer repairs made by the dealer within a 3-month period before the dealer’s written request for a change in reimbursement pursuant to this section, or all of the retail customer repair orders over that 3-month period if there are fewer than 50 retail customer repair orders in that period. The motor vehicle dealer shall give the licensee 10 days’ written notice that it intends to make a written request to the licensee for a warranty parts reimbursement increase and permit the licensee, within that 10-day period, to select the initial retail customer repair for the consecutive repair orders that will be attached to the written request used for the markup computation, provided that if the licensee fails to provide a timely selection, the dealer may make that selection. No repair order shall be excluded from the markup computation because it contains both warranty, extended warranty, certified pre-owned warranty, maintenance, recall, campaign service, or authorized goodwill work and a retail customer repair. However, only the retail customer repair portion of the repair order shall be included in the computation, and the parts described in paragraph (b) shall be excluded from the computation; 2. The licensee’s highest suggested retail or list price for the parts; or 3. An amount equal to the dealer’s markup over dealer cost that results in the same gross profit percentage for parts used in work done under subsection (1) as the dealer receives for parts used in the customer retail repairs, as evidenced by the average of said dealer’s gross profit percentage in the dealer’s financial statements for the 2 months preceding the dealer’s request. If a licensee reduces the suggested retail or list price for any replacement part or accessory, it also shall reduce, by at least the same percentage, the cost to the dealer for the part or accessory. The dealer’s markup or gross profit percentage shall be uniformly applied to all of the licensee’s parts used by the dealer in performing work covered by subsection (1). (b) In calculating the compensation to be paid for parts by the arithmetical mean percentage markup over dealer cost method in paragraph (a), parts discounted by a dealer for repairs made in group, fleet, insurance, or other third-party payor service work; parts used in repairs of government agencies’ repairs for which volume discounts have been negotiated; parts used in special events, specials, or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs; parts sold at wholesale; parts used for internal repairs; engine assemblies and transmission assemblies; parts used in retail customer repairs for routine maintenance, such as fluids, filters and belts; nuts, bolts, fasteners, and similar items that do not have an individual part number; and tires shall be excluded in determining the percentage markup over dealer cost. (c) If a licensee furnishes a part or component to a motor vehicle dealer at no cost to use in performing repairs under a recall, campaign service action, or warranty repair, the licensee shall compensate the dealer for the part or component in the same manner as warranty parts compensation under this subsection, less the dealer cost for the part or component as listed in the licensee’s price schedule. (d) A licensee shall not establish or implement a special part or component number for parts used in predelivery, dealer preparation, warranty, extended warranty, certified pre-owned warranty, recall, campaign service, authorized goodwill, or maintenance-only applications if that results in lower compensation to the dealer than as calculated in this subsection. (4)(a) A licensee shall compensate a motor vehicle dealer for labor performed in connection with work described in subsection (1) as calculated in this subsection. (b) Compensation paid by a licensee to a motor vehicle dealer may be an agreed hourly labor rate. If, however, an agreement is not reached within 30 days after the dealer’s written request, the dealer may choose to be paid the greater of: 1. The dealer’s hourly labor rate for retail customer repairs, determined by dividing the amount of the dealer’s total labor sales for retail customer repairs by the number of total labor hours that generated those sales for the month preceding the request, excluding the work in paragraph (c); or 2. An amount equal to the dealer’s markup over dealer cost that results in the same gross profit percentage for labor hours performed in work covered by subsection (1) as the dealer receives for labor performed in its customer retail repairs, as evidenced by the average of said dealer’s gross profit percentage in the dealer’s financial statements provided to the licensee for the 2 months preceding the dealer’s written request, if the dealer provides in the written request the arithmetical mean of the hourly wage paid to all of its technicians during that preceding month. The arithmetical mean shall be the dealer cost used in that calculation. After an hourly labor rate is agreed or determined, the licensee shall uniformly apply and pay that hourly labor rate for all labor used by the dealer in performing work under subsection (1). However, a licensee shall not pay an hourly labor rate less than the hourly rate it was paying to the dealer for work done under subsection (1) on January 2, 2008. A licensee shall not eliminate flat-rate times from or establish an unreasonable flat-rate time in its warranty repair manual, warranty time guide, or any other similarly named document. A licensee shall establish reasonable flat-rate labor times in its warranty repair manuals and warranty time guides for newly introduced model motor vehicles which are at least consistent with its existing documents. As used in this subsection, the terms “retail customer repair” and “similar work” are not limited to a repair to the same model vehicle or model year, but include prior repairs that resemble but are not identical to the repair for which the dealer is making a claim for compensation. (c) In determining the hourly labor rate calculated under subparagraph (b)1., a dealer’s labor charges for internal vehicle repairs; vehicle reconditioning; repairs performed for group, fleet, insurance, or other third-party payors; discounted repairs of motor vehicles for government agencies; labor used in special events, specials, or express service; and promotional discounts shall not be included as retail customer repairs and shall be excluded from such calculations. (5) A licensee shall not review, change, or fail to pay a motor vehicle dealer for parts or labor determined under this section unless the dealer has requested a change, or the action is pursuant to the licensee’s written, predetermined schedule for increasing parts or labor compensation that is not contrary to any provision of this section. A dealer may make written requests for changes in compensation for parts or labor performed under this section not more than semiannually. The dealer shall attach supporting documentation to each written request. Any increase in parts or labor reimbursement determined thereafter to be owed to the dealer shall be paid pursuant to this section retroactively for all claims filed by a dealer 15 days after the date of the licensee’s receipt of the dealer’s written request. (6) A licensee shall not recover or attempt to recover, directly or indirectly, any of its costs for compensating a motor vehicle dealer under this section. (7) A licensee shall not require, influence, or attempt to influence a motor vehicle dealer to implement or change the prices for which it sells parts or labor in retail customer repairs. A licensee shall not implement or continue a policy, procedure, or program to any of its dealers in this state for compensation under this section which is inconsistent with this section. (8) If a court determines with finality that any provision of this section is void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall not be affected but shall remain in effect.

      "text": "320.77 License required of mobile home dealers.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section: (a) “Dealer” means any person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in mobile homes or offering or displaying mobile homes for sale. The term “dealer” includes a mobile home broker. Any person who buys, sells, deals in, or offers or displays for sale, or who acts as the agent for the sale of, one or more mobile homes in any 12-month period shall be prima facie presumed to be a dealer. The terms “selling” and “sale” include lease-purchase transactions. The term “dealer” does not include banks, credit unions, and finance companies that acquire mobile homes as an incident to their regular business and does not include mobile home rental and leasing companies that sell mobile homes to dealers licensed under this section. A licensed dealer may transact business in recreational vehicles with a motor vehicle auction as defined in s. 320.27(1)(c)4. Any licensed dealer dealing exclusively in mobile homes shall not have benefit of the privilege of using dealer license plates. (b) “Mobile home broker” means any person who is engaged in the business of offering to procure or procuring used mobile homes for the general public; who holds himself or herself out through solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as one who offers to procure or procures used mobile homes for the general public; or who acts as the agent or intermediary on behalf of the owner or seller of a used mobile home which is for sale or who assists or represents the seller in finding a buyer for the mobile home. (c)1. “Mobile home salesperson” means a person not otherwise expressly excluded by this section who: a. Is employed as a salesperson by a mobile home dealer, as defined in this section, or who, under any contract, agreement, or arrangement with a dealer, for a commission, money, profit, or any other thing of value, sells, exchanges, buys, or offers for sale, negotiates, or attempts to negotiate a sale or exchange of an interest in a mobile home required to be titled under this chapter; b. Induces or attempts to induce any person to buy or exchange an interest in a mobile home required to be registered and who receives or expects to receive a commission, money, brokerage fees, profit, or any other thing of value from the seller or purchaser of the mobile home; or c. Exercises managerial control over the business of a licensed mobile home dealer or who supervises mobile home salespersons employed by a licensed mobile home dealer, whether compensated by salary or commission, including, but not limited to, any person who is employed by the mobile home dealer as a general manager, assistant general manager, or sales manager, or any employee of a licensed mobile home dealer who negotiates with or induces a customer to enter into a security agreement or purchase agreement or purchase order for the sale of a mobile home on behalf of the licensed mobile home dealer. 2. The term does not include: a. A representative of an insurance company or a finance company, or a public official who, in the regular course of business, is required to dispose of or sell mobile homes under a contractual right or obligation of the employer, in the performance of an official duty, or under the authority of any court if the sale is to save the seller from any loss or pursuant to the authority of a court. b. A person who is licensed as a manufacturer, remanufacturer, transporter, distributor, or representative of mobile homes. c. A person who is licensed as a mobile home dealer under this chapter. d. A person not engaged in the purchase or sale of mobile homes as a business who is disposing of mobile homes acquired for his or her own use or for use in his or her business if the mobile homes were acquired and used in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this chapter. (2) LICENSE REQUIRED.—No person shall engage in business as, or serve in the capacity of, a dealer in this state unless such person possesses a valid, current license as provided in this section. (3) APPLICATION.—The application for such license shall be in the form prescribed by the department and subject to such rules as may be prescribed by it. The application shall be verified by oath or affirmation and shall contain: (a) A full statement of the name and the date of birth of the person or persons applying therefor. (b) The name of the firm or copartnership with the names and places of residence of all its members, if the applicant is a firm or copartnership. (c) The names and places of residence of the principal officers, if the applicant is a body corporate or other artificial body. (d) The name of the state under whose laws the corporation is organized. (e) The former place or places of residence of the applicant. (f) The prior businesses in which the applicant has been engaged, the dates during which the applicant was engaged in such businesses, and the locations thereof. (g) A description of the exact location of the place of business, when it was acquired, and whether it is owned in fee simple by the applicant. If leased, a true copy of the lease shall be attached to the application. (h) Certification by the applicant: 1. That the location is a permanent one, not a tent or a temporary stand or other temporary quarters. 2. Except in the case of a mobile home broker, that the location affords sufficient space to display homes for sale. A space to display a manufactured home as a model home is sufficient to satisfy this requirement. The location must be a suitable place in which the applicant can in good faith carry on business and keep and maintain books, records, and files necessary to conduct such business, which must be available at all reasonable hours to inspection by the department or any of its inspectors or other employees. This paragraph does not preclude a licensed mobile home dealer from displaying and offering for sale mobile homes in a mobile home park. (i) Certification by the applicant that the business of a mobile home dealer is the principal business which shall be conducted at that location; however, this provision shall not apply to mobile home park operators licensed as mobile home dealers. (j) Such other relevant information as may be required by the department. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a corporate applicant, must file a set of fingerprints with the department for the purpose of determining any prior criminal record or any outstanding warrants. The department shall submit the fingerprinting to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for federal processing. The actual cost of such state and federal processing shall be borne by the applicant and is to be in addition to the fee for licensure. The department may issue a license to an applicant pending the results of the fingerprint investigation, which license is fully revocable if the department subsequently determines that any facts set forth in the application are not true or correctly represented. The department shall, if it deems necessary, cause an investigation to be made to ascertain if the facts set forth in the application are true and shall not issue a license to the applicant until it is satisfied that the facts set forth in the application are true. (4) FEES.—Upon making initial application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 in addition to any other fees required by law. Applicants may choose to extend the licensure period for 1 additional year for a total of 2 years. An initial applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 for the first year and $100 for the second year in addition to any other fees required by law. An applicant for a renewal license shall pay to the department $100 for a 1-year renewal or $200 for a 2-year renewal. The fee for application for change of location shall be $25. Any applicant for renewal who has failed to submit a renewal application by October 1 of the year of its current license expiration shall pay a renewal application fee equal to the original application fee. No fee is refundable. All fees shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. (5) DENIAL OF LICENSE.—The department may deny any applicant a license on the ground that: (a) The applicant has made a material misstatement in his or her application for a license. (b) The applicant has failed to comply with any applicable provision of this chapter. (c) The applicant has failed to provide warranty service. (d) The applicant or one or more of his or her principals or agents has violated any law, rule, or regulation relating to the sale of mobile homes. (e) The department has proof of unfitness of the applicant. (f) The applicant or licensee has engaged in previous conduct in any state which would have been a ground for revocation or suspension of a license in this state. (g) The applicant or licensee has violated any of the provisions of the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 or any rule or regulation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development promulgated thereunder. Upon denial of a license, the department shall notify the applicant within 10 days, stating in writing its grounds for denial. The applicant is entitled to a public hearing and may request that such hearing be held within 45 days of denial of the license. All proceedings shall be pursuant to chapter 120. (6) LICENSE CERTIFICATE.—A license certificate shall be issued by the department in accordance with the application when the same is regular in form and in compliance with the provisions of this section. The license certificate may be in the form of a document or a computerized card as determined by the department. The cost of each original, additional, or replacement computerized card shall be borne by the licensee and is in addition to the fee for licensure. The fees charged applicants for both the required background investigation and the computerized card as provided in this section shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. The license, when so issued, shall entitle the licensee to carry on and conduct the business of a mobile home dealer at the location set forth in the license for a period of 1 or 2 years beginning October 1 preceding the date of issuance. Each initial application received by the department shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant or one or more of his or her designated employees has attended a training and information seminar conducted by the department or by a public or private provider approved by the department. Such seminar shall include, but not be limited to, statutory dealer requirements, which requirements include required bookkeeping and recording procedures, requirements for the collection of sales and use taxes, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. (7) SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE.—Any person licensed pursuant to this section shall be entitled to operate one or more additional places of business under a supplemental license for each such business if the ownership of each business is identical to that of the principal business for which the original license is issued. Each supplemental license shall run concurrently with the original license and shall be issued upon application by the licensee on a form to be furnished by the department and payment of a fee of $50 for each such license. Only one licensed dealer shall operate at the same place of business. A supplemental license authorizing off-premises sales shall be issued, at no charge to the dealer, for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive calendar days. (8) RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY LICENSEE.—Each licensee shall keep records in such form as shall be prescribed by the department. Such records shall include: (a) A record of the purchase, sale, or exchange, or receipt for the purpose of sale, of any mobile home; (b) The description of each such mobile home, including the identification or serial number and such other numbers or identification marks as may be thereon, and a statement that a number has been obliterated, defaced, or changed, if such fact is apparent; and (c) The name and address of the seller, the purchaser, and the alleged owner or other person from whom the mobile home was purchased or received and the person to whom it was sold or delivered, as the case may be. (9) SALESPERSONS TO BE REGISTERED BY LICENSEES.— (a) Each licensee shall register with the department, within 30 days after the date of hire, the name, local residence address, and home telephone number of each person employed by such licensee as a mobile home salesperson. A licensee may not provide a post office box in lieu of a physical residential address. (b) Each time a mobile home salesperson employed by a licensee changes his or her residence address, the salesperson must notify the department within 20 days after the change. (c) Quarterly, each licensee shall notify the department of the termination or separation from employment of each mobile home salesperson employed by the licensee. Each notification must be on a form prescribed by the department. (10) EVIDENCE OF TITLE REQUIRED.—The licensee shall also have in his or her possession for each new mobile home a manufacturer’s invoice or statement of origin, and for each used mobile home a properly assigned certificate of title or registration certificate if the used mobile home was previously registered in a nontitle state, from the time the mobile home is delivered to the licensee until it has been disposed of by him or her. (11) SETUP OPERATIONS.—Each licensee may perform setup operations only as defined in s. 320.822, and the department shall provide by rule for the uniform application of all existing statutory provisions relating to licensing and setup operations. (12) PENALTY.—The violation of any provision of this section is a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (13) INJUNCTION.—In addition to the remedies provided in this chapter, and notwithstanding the existence of any adequate remedy at law, the department is authorized to make application to any circuit court of the state, and the circuit court shall have jurisdiction, upon a hearing and for cause shown, to grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from acting as a mobile home dealer under the terms of this section who is not properly licensed or who violates or fails or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of chapter 319 and this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder. Such injunction shall be issued without bond. A single act in violation of the provisions of chapter 319 or this chapter shall be sufficient to authorize the issuance of an injunction. (14) SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.—The department shall, as it deems necessary, either suspend or revoke any license issued hereunder upon a finding that the licensee violated any provision of this section or of any other law of this state having to do with dealing in mobile homes or perpetrated a fraud upon any person as a result of such dealing in mobile homes. (15) ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.—In addition to the exercise of other powers provided in this section, the department is authorized to assess, impose, levy, and collect by legal process fines, in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, against any licensee if it finds that a licensee has violated any provision of this section or has violated any other law of this state having to do with dealing in motor vehicles. Any licensee shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to chapter 120 should the licensee wish to contest the fine levied, or about to be levied, upon him or her. (16) SURETY BOND, CASH BOND, OR IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT REQUIRED.— (a) Before any license shall be issued or renewed, the applicant or licensee shall deliver to the department a good and sufficient surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit, executed by the applicant or licensee as principal. Within 10 calendar days after any renewal or continuation of or material change in such surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit or issuance of a new surety bond, a licensee shall deliver to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department, a copy of the renewed, continued, changed, or new surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be in a form to be approved by the department and shall be conditioned upon the dealer’s complying with the conditions of any written contract made by the dealer in connection with the sale, exchange, or improvement of any mobile home and his or her not violating any of the provisions of chapter 319 or this chapter in the conduct of the business for which the dealer is licensed. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be to the department and in favor of any retail customer who shall suffer any loss as a result of any violation of the conditions contained in this section. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be for the license period, and a new bond or irrevocable letter of credit or a proper continuation certificate shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. However, the aggregate liability of the surety in any one license year shall in no event exceed the sum of such bond, or, in the case of a letter of credit, the aggregate liability of the issuing bank shall not exceed the sum of the credit. The amount of the bond required shall be as follows: 1. A single dealer who buys, sells, or deals in mobile homes and who has four or fewer supplemental licenses shall provide a surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit executed by the dealer applicant or licensee in the amount of $25,000. 2. A single dealer who buys, sells, or deals in mobile homes and who has more than four supplemental licenses shall provide a surety bond, cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit executed by the dealer applicant or licensee in the amount of $50,000. For the purposes of this paragraph, any person who buys, sells, or deals in both mobile homes and recreational vehicles shall provide the same surety bond required of dealers who buy, sell, or deal in mobile homes only. (b) Surety bonds shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state as surety, and irrevocable letters of credit shall be issued by a bank authorized to do business in the state as a bank. (c) Irrevocable letters of credit shall be engaged by a bank as an agreement to honor demands for payment as specified in this section. (d) The department shall, upon denial, suspension, or revocation of any license, notify the surety company of the licensee or bank issuing an irrevocable letter of credit for the licensee, in writing, that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked and shall state the reason for such denial, suspension, or revocation.

      "heading": "License required of recreational vehicle dealers.",
      "text": "320.771 License required of recreational vehicle dealers.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a)1. “Dealer” means any person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in recreational vehicles or offering or displaying recreational vehicles for sale. The term “dealer” includes a recreational vehicle broker. Any person who buys, sells, deals in, or offers or displays for sale, or who acts as the agent for the sale of, one or more recreational vehicles in any 12-month period shall be prima facie presumed to be a dealer. The terms “selling” and “sale” include lease-purchase transactions. The term “dealer” does not include banks, credit unions, and finance companies that acquire recreational vehicles as an incident to their regular business and does not include mobile home rental and leasing companies that sell recreational vehicles to dealers licensed under this section. 2. A licensed dealer may transact business in recreational vehicles with a motor vehicle auction as defined in s. 320.27(1)(c)4. Further, a licensed dealer may, at retail or wholesale, sell a motor vehicle, as described in s. 320.01(1)(a), acquired in exchange for the sale of a recreational vehicle, if the acquisition is incidental to the principal business of being a recreational vehicle dealer. However, a recreational vehicle dealer may not buy a motor vehicle for the purpose of resale unless licensed as a motor vehicle dealer pursuant to s. 320.27. A dealer may apply for a certificate of title to a recreational vehicle required to be registered under s. 320.08(9), using a manufacturer’s statement of origin as permitted by s. 319.23(1), only if the dealer is authorized by a manufacturer/dealer agreement, as defined in s. 320.3202, on file with the department, to buy, sell, or deal in that particular line-make of recreational vehicle, and the dealer is authorized by the manufacturer/dealer agreement to perform delivery and preparation obligations and warranty defect adjustments on that line-make. (b) “Recreational vehicle broker” means any person who is engaged in the business of offering to procure or procuring used recreational vehicles for the general public; who holds himself or herself out through solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as one who offers to procure or procures used recreational vehicles for the general public; or who acts as the agent or intermediary on behalf of the owner or seller of a used recreational vehicle which is for sale or who assists or represents the seller in finding a buyer for the recreational vehicle. (c) “Recreational vehicle” does not include any camping trailer, as defined in s. 320.01(1)(b)2. (2) LICENSE REQUIRED.—No person shall engage in business as, or serve in the capacity of, a dealer in this state unless such person possesses a valid, current license as provided in this section. Motor vehicle dealers licensed under s. 320.27 shall not be required to obtain the license provided in this section to sell motor vehicles as defined in s. 320.01(1)(b)4., 5., and 6. (3) APPLICATION.—The application for such license shall be in the form prescribed by the department and subject to such rules as may be prescribed by it. The application shall be verified by oath or affirmation and shall contain: (a) A full statement of the name and the date of birth of the person or persons applying therefor. (b) The name of the firm or copartnership with the names and places of residence of all its members, if the applicant is a firm or copartnership. (c) The names and places of residence of the principal officers, if the applicant is a body corporate or other artificial body. (d) The name of the state under whose laws the corporation is organized. (e) The former place or places of residence of the applicant. (f) The prior businesses in which the applicant has been engaged, the dates during which the applicant was engaged in such businesses, and the locations thereof. (g) A description of the exact location of the place of business, when it was acquired, and whether it is owned in fee simple by the applicant. If leased, a true copy of the lease shall be attached to the application. (h) Certification by the applicant that the location is a permanent one, not a tent or a temporary stand or other temporary quarters; that the location affords sufficient unoccupied space to store all recreational vehicles offered and displayed for sale; and that the location is a suitable place in which the applicant can in good faith carry on business and keep and maintain books, records, and files necessary to conduct such business, which will be available at all reasonable hours to inspection by the department or any of its inspectors or other employees. (i) Certification by the applicant that the business of a recreational vehicle dealer is the principal business which shall be conducted at that location; however, this provision shall not apply to recreational vehicle or mobile home park operators licensed as mobile home or recreational vehicle dealers. (j) Evidence that the applicant is insured under a garage liability insurance policy, which shall include, at a minimum, $25,000 combined single-limit liability coverage, including bodily injury and property damage protection, and $10,000 personal injury protection, if the applicant is to be licensed as a dealer in, or intends to sell, recreational vehicles. Such policy must be for the license period. Within 10 calendar days after any renewal or continuation of or material change in such policy or issuance of a new policy, the licensee shall deliver to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department, a copy of such renewed, continued, changed, or new policy. However, a garage liability policy is not required for the licensure of a mobile home dealer who sells only park trailers. (k) A statement that the applicant for a recreational vehicle license, issued pursuant to this section, has not and will not enter into any agreements, written or oral, with any other person or business entity which would constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice in violation of part II of chapter 501. (l) Such other relevant information as may be required by the department. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a corporate applicant, must file a set of fingerprints with the department for the purpose of determining any prior criminal record or any outstanding warrants. The department shall submit the fingerprinting to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for federal processing. The actual cost of such state and federal processing shall be borne by the applicant and is to be in addition to the fee for licensure. The department may issue a license to an applicant pending the results of the fingerprint investigation, which license is fully revocable if the department subsequently determines that any facts set forth in the application are not true or correctly represented. The department shall, if it deems necessary, cause an investigation to be made to ascertain if the facts set forth in the application are true and shall not issue a license to the applicant until it is satisfied that the facts set forth in the application are true. (4) FEES.—Upon making initial application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 in addition to any other fees required by law. Applicants may choose to extend the licensure period for 1 additional year for a total of 2 years. An initial applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 for the first year and $100 for the second year in addition to any other fees required by law. An applicant for a renewal license shall pay to the department $100 for a 1-year renewal or $200 for a 2-year renewal. The fee for application for change of location shall be $25. Any applicant for renewal who has failed to submit a renewal application by October 1 of the year of its current license expiration shall pay a renewal application fee equal to the original application fee. No fee is refundable. All fees shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund. (5) DENIAL OF LICENSE.—The department may deny any applicant a license on the ground that: (a) The applicant has made a material misstatement in the application for a license. (b) The applicant has failed to comply with any applicable provision of this chapter. (c) The applicant has failed to provide warranty service. (d) The applicant or one or more of the applicant’s principals or agents has violated any law, rule, or regulation relating to the sale of recreational vehicles. (e) The department has proof of unfitness of the applicant. (f) The applicant or licensee has engaged in previous conduct in any state which would have been a ground for revocation or suspension of a license in this state. (g) The applicant or licensee has violated any of the provisions of the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 or any rule or regulation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development promulgated thereunder. Upon denial of a license, the department shall notify the applicant within 10 days, stating in writing its grounds for denial. The applicant is entitled to a public hearing and may request that such hearing be held within 45 days of denial of the license. All proceedings shall be pursuant to chapter 120. (6) LICENSE CERTIFICATE.—A license certificate shall be issued by the department in accordance with the application when the same is regular in form and in compliance with the provisions of this section. The license certificate may be in the form of a document or a computerized card as determined by the department. The cost of each original, additional, or replacement computerized card shall be borne by the licensee and is in addition to the fee for licensure. The fees charged applicants for both the required background investigation and the computerized card as provided in this section shall be deposited into the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. The license, when so issued, shall entitle the licensee to carry on and conduct the business of a recreational vehicle dealer at the location set forth in the license for a period of 1 or 2 years from October 1 preceding the date of issuance. Each initial application received by the department shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant or one or more of his or her designated employees has attended a training and information seminar conducted by the department or by a public or private provider approved by the department. Such seminar shall include, but not be limited to, statutory dealer requirements, which requirements include required bookkeeping and recording procedures, requirements for the collection of sales and use taxes, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. (7) SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE.—A person licensed under this section shall be entitled to operate one or more additional places of business under a supplemental license for each such business if the ownership of each business is identical to that of the principal business for which the original license is issued. Each supplemental license shall run concurrently with the original license and shall be issued upon application by the licensee on a form to be furnished by the department and payment of a fee of $50 for each such license. Only one licensed dealer shall operate at the same place of business. A supplemental license authorizing off-premises sales shall be issued, at no charge to the dealer, for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive days. A licensed dealer who conducts an off-premises sale not in conjunction with a public vehicle show, as defined in s. 320.3203(5)(c), shall: (a) Notify the applicable local department office of the specific dates and location for which such license is requested. (b) Provide staff to work at the temporary location for the duration of the off-premises sale. (c) Meet all local government permit requirements. (d) Have the permission of the property owner to operate at that location. (e) Conspicuously display a sign at the licensed location which clearly identifies the dealer’s name and business address as listed on the dealer’s original license. (f) Prominently include the dealer’s name and business address, as listed on the dealer’s original license, in all advertisements associated with such sale. (8) LICENSE ENDORSEMENT.—Any mobile home dealer licensed pursuant to s. 320.77, may apply to the department for authority to sell recreational vehicles. The mobile home dealer shall file an application required by this section and shall be governed by the licensing provisions contained herein. No additional license fees or bond shall be required for issuance of this endorsement to the mobile home dealer’s license. (9) RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY LICENSEE.—Each licensee shall keep records in such form as shall be prescribed by the department. Such records shall include: (a) A record of the purchase, sale, or exchange, or receipt for the purpose of sale, of any recreational vehicle. (b) The description of each such recreational vehicle, including the identification or serial number and such other numbers or identification marks as may be thereon, and a statement that a number has been obliterated, defaced, or changed, if such fact is apparent. (c) The name and address of the seller, the purchaser, and the alleged owner or other person from whom the recreational vehicle was purchased or received and the person to whom it was sold or delivered, as the case may be. (10) EVIDENCE OF TITLE REQUIRED.— (a) The licensee shall also have in his or her possession for each new recreational vehicle a manufacturer’s invoice or statement of origin. (b) For each used recreational vehicle in the possession of a licensee and offered for sale by him or her, the licensee either shall have in his or her possession or control a duly assigned certificate of title from the owner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319, or a registration certificate if the used recreational vehicle was previously registered in a nontitle state, from the time when the vehicle is delivered to the licensee and offered for sale by him or her until it has been disposed of by the licensee, or shall have reasonable indicia of ownership or right of possession, or shall have made proper application for a certificate of title or duplicate certificate of title in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319. A dealer may not sell or offer for sale a vehicle in his or her possession unless the dealer satisfies the requirements of this subsection. Reasonable indicia of ownership shall include a duly assigned certificate of title; in the case of a new vehicle, a manufacturer’s certificate of origin issued to or reassigned to the dealer; a consignment contract between the owner and the dealer along with a secure power of attorney from the owner to the dealer authorizing the dealer to apply for a duplicate certificate of title and assign the title on behalf of the owner; a court order awarding title to the vehicle to the dealer; a salvage certificate of title; a photocopy of a duly assigned certificate of title being held by a financial institution as collateral for a business loan of money to the dealer (“floor plan”); a copy of a canceled check or other documentation evidencing that an outstanding lien on a vehicle taken in trade by a licensed dealer has been satisfied and that the certificate of title will be, but has not yet been, received by the dealer; a vehicle purchase order or installment contract for a specific vehicle identifying that vehicle as a trade-in on a replacement vehicle; or a duly executed odometer disclosure statement as required by Title IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (Pub. L. No. 92-513, as amended by Pub. L. No. 94-364 and Pub. L. No. 100-561) and by 49 C.F.R. part 580 bearing the signatures of the titled owners of a traded-in vehicle. (11) SETUP OPERATIONS.—Each licensee may perform setup operations only as defined in s. 320.822, and the department shall provide by rule for the uniform application of all existing statutory provisions relating to licensing and setup operations. (12) PENALTY.—The violation of any provision of this section is a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (13) INJUNCTION.—In addition to the remedies provided in this chapter, and notwithstanding the existence of any adequate remedy at law, the department is authorized to make application to any circuit court of the state, and the circuit court shall have jurisdiction, upon a hearing and for cause shown, to grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from acting as a recreational vehicle dealer under the terms of this section who is not properly licensed or who violates or fails or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of chapter 319 and this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted thereunder. Such injunction shall be issued without bond. A single act in violation of the provisions of chapter 319 or this chapter shall be sufficient to authorize the issuance of an injunction. (14) SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.—The department shall, as it deems necessary, either suspend or revoke any license issued hereunder upon a finding that the licensee violated any provision of this section or of any other law of this state having to do with dealing in recreational vehicles or perpetrated a fraud upon any person as a result of such dealing in recreational vehicles. (15) ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.—In addition to the exercise of other powers provided in this section, the department is authorized to assess, impose, levy, and collect by legal process fines, in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, against any licensee if it finds that a licensee has violated any provision of this section or has violated any other law of this state having to do with dealing in motor vehicles. Any licensee shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to chapter 120 should the licensee wish to contest the fine levied, or about to be levied, upon him or her. (16) BOND.— (a) Before any license shall be issued or renewed, the applicant shall deliver to the department a good and sufficient surety bond, executed by the applicant as principal and by a surety company qualified to do business in the state as surety. Within 10 calendar days after any renewal or continuation of or material change in such surety bond or issuance of a new surety bond, a licensee shall deliver to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department, a copy of such renewed, continued, changed, or new surety bond. The bond shall be in a form to be approved by the department and shall be conditioned upon the dealer’s complying with the conditions of any written contract made by that dealer in connection with the sale, exchange, or improvement of any recreational vehicle and his or her not violating any of the provisions of chapter 319 or this chapter in the conduct of the business for which he or she is licensed. The bond shall be to the department and in favor of any retail customer who shall suffer any loss as a result of any violation of the conditions hereinabove contained. The bond shall be for the license period, and a new bond or a proper continuation certificate shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. However, the aggregate liability of the surety in any one license year shall in no event exceed the sum of such bond. The amount of the bond required shall be as follows: 1. A single dealer who buys, sells, or deals in recreational vehicles and has four or fewer supplemental licenses shall provide a surety bond in the amount of $10,000. 2. A single dealer who buys, sells, or deals in recreational vehicles and who has more than four supplemental licenses shall provide a surety bond in the amount of $20,000. For the purposes of this paragraph, any person who buys, sells, or deals in both mobile homes and recreational vehicles shall provide the same surety bond required of dealers who buy, sell, or deal in mobile homes only. (b) The department shall, upon denial, suspension, or revocation of any license, notify the surety company of the licensee, in writing, that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked and shall state the reason for such denial, suspension, or revocation. (c) Any surety company which pays any claim against the bond of any licensee shall notify the department, in writing, that it has paid such a claim and shall state the amount of the claim. (d) Any surety company which cancels the bond of any licensee shall notify the department, in writing, of such cancellation, giving reason for the cancellation. (17) PROHIBITED COMMISSION SHARING.—In accordance with the provisions of s. 626.753, a dealer or recreational vehicle broker, as defined in this section, who is not a licensed insurance agent may not share in the commission on the sale of insurance coverage on the types of recreational vehicles defined in s. 320.01(1)(b) by the creation of a foreign partnership, corporation, or other entity which is controlled by a person or entity not licensed as an insurance agent.

Said license shall be renewed annually, and each licensee shall pay a fee of $150. (2) The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall issue a license as a mobile home installer to any person who applies to the department, pays the appropriate application fee, not to exceed $100, as set by department rule, and complies with subsection (3). (3) In order to obtain licensure as a mobile home installer, the applicant must be at least 18 years old, must hold a valid performance bond in an amount set by department rule, not to exceed $5,000, conditioned upon proper performance of mobile home installation and weather-sealing duties for a period of 1 year, must carry liability insurance in an amount determined by department rule, not to exceed $100,000, must complete a minimum 8-hour training course approved by the department, and must pass a department-approved examination designed to test the skills necessary to properly and competently perform mobile home installation and to ascertain that the applicant has adequate knowledge of federal, state, and local laws applicable to mobile home installation contracting. The department may charge an examination fee sufficient to defray the costs of developing or obtaining and providing the examination, not to exceed $100. Any licensed dealer or licensed manufacturer who has subcontracted with an installer for installation and who remedies any faulty installation performed by said installer shall have recourse against said installer’s performance bond. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3), any person who can show that he or she had been engaged in the business of mobile home installation on October 1, 1996, shall be exempted until October 1, 1997, from the requirement for completing training and for passing an examination in order to be licensed by the department as a mobile home installer and shall be licensed upon application, provided he or she has complied with all requirements of subsection (3), other than the training and examination requirements. No person shall be licensed or remain licensed as a mobile home installer subsequent to October 1, 1997, who has not taken and passed the department-approved mobile home installer examination. (5) A direct employee of a licensed mobile home installer working under the supervision of the licensee and within the job scope of the licensee is not required to be licensed as a mobile home installer. The licensed mobile home installer is responsible for supervising all such employees and for the proper and competent performance of all employees working under his or her supervision. (6) “Installation,” as used herein, is synonymous with “setup” as defined in s. 320.822(14). (7) No person shall: (a) Falsely hold himself or herself or a business organization out as a licensed mobile home installer; (b) Falsely impersonate a licensed mobile home installer; (c) Present as his or her own the mobile home installers license of another; (d) Knowingly give false or forged evidence to the department; (e) Use or attempt to use a mobile home installers license which has been suspended or revoked; or (f) Engage in the business or act in the capacity of a licensed mobile home installer or advertise himself or herself or a business organization as available to engage in the business or act in the capacity of a mobile home installer without being duly licensed. (8) Any unlicensed person who violates any of the provisions of subsection (7) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (9) A licensed person or licensed applicant may not: (a) Obtain a mobile home installers license by fraud or misrepresentation. (b) Be convicted or found guilty of, or enter a plea of nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a crime in any jurisdiction which directly relates to the practice of mobile home installation or the ability to practice.

(11) The regulation of manufactured home installers or mobile home installers is preempted to the state, and no person may perform mobile home installation unless licensed pursuant to this section, regardless of whether that person holds a local license. (12) A county, municipality, or other unit of local government may not require additional licensing, bonding, or insurance of a duly licensed installer who performs setup operations as defined in s. 320.822. However, a county, municipality, or other unit of local government may require an installer to obtain a local occupational license, which license shall not require for its issuance any conditions other than those required by this chapter and payment of the appropriate occupational license fee. (13) All installers, dealers, and manufacturers shall purchase installation decals from the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for a fee not to exceed $10 per decal. An installation decal shall be affixed to the manufactured home or mobile home prior to installation. This decal shall denote the date of installation, the name of the installer, and the number of the installer’s license or the dealer or manufacturer license number. Such decal shall be positioned immediately next to the HUD decal. (14) Each installer shall maintain a location log for each decal for 2 years. This requirement must not take effect until the department develops an acceptable format for the log and provides a sample of the acceptable format to each licensed installer. (15) In performing the installation, installers shall not perform plumbing or electrical activities prohibited by department rules related to setup operations pursuant to s. 320.822. (16) Funds received by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund. (17) There are hereby appropriated five positions and $219,295 from the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund in the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to implement the provisions of this section.

The warranty requirements of each manufacturer, dealer, installer, and supplier of mobile homes or recreational vehicles are as follows: (1) The manufacturer warrants: (a) For a mobile home or recreational vehicle, that all structural elements; plumbing systems; heating, cooling, and fuel-burning systems; electrical systems; fire prevention systems; and any other components or conditions included by the manufacturer are free from substantial defect. (b) That 100-ampere electrical service exists in the mobile home. (2) The dealer warrants: (a) That any modifications or alterations made to the mobile home or recreational vehicle by the dealer or authorized by the dealer shall be free from substantial defect. Alterations or modifications made by a dealer shall relieve the manufacturer of warranty responsibility only as to the item altered or modified. (b) That setup operations performed on the mobile home are performed in compliance with s. 320.8325. (c) That substantial defects do not occur to the mobile home during setup or by transporting it to the occupancy site. When the setup of a mobile home is performed by a person who is not an employee or agent of the mobile home manufacturer or dealer and is not compensated or authorized by, or connected with, such manufacturer or dealer, then the warranty responsibility of the manufacturer or dealer as to setup shall be limited to transporting the mobile home to the occupancy site free from substantial defect. (3) The installer warrants that the setup operations performed on the mobile home are performed in compliance with s. 320.8325 and department rules governing the installation. (4) The supplier warrants that any warranties generally offered in the ordinary sale of his or her product to consumers shall be extended to buyers of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. When no warranty is extended by suppliers, the manufacturer shall assume warranty responsibility for that component. (5) The department may adopt rules under chapter 120 to resolve disputes that may arise among the mobile home manufacturer, dealer, installer, or supplier.

(3) The defect shall be remedied within 30 days of receipt of the written notification of the warranty claim unless the claim is unreasonable or bona fide reasons exist for not remedying the defect. When sufficient reasons exist for not remedying the defect or the claim is unreasonable, the responsible party shall respond to the claimant in writing with its reasons for not promptly remedying the defect and what further action is contemplated by the responsible party. (4) When the person remedying the defect is not the responsible party as designated by s. 320.835 he or she shall be entitled to reasonable compensation paid to him or her by the responsible party.
