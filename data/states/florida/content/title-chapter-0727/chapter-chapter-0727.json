Except in the case of a consensual lienholder enforcing its rights in personal property or real property collateral, there shall be no levy, execution, attachment, or the like in respect of any judgment against assets of the estate in the possession, custody, or control of the assignee. (2) The assignee may: (a) Rely on any outstanding court orders, judgments, decrees, and rules of law, and is not personally liable for the assignee’s own good faith compliance with any such orders, judgments, decrees, or rules of law. (b) Rely on, and shall be protected in any action by, any resolution, certificate, statement, opinion, report, notice, consent, or other document believed by the assignee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper parties.

(b) The assignee’s acts or omissions, except upon a finding by the court presiding over an action or proceeding under this chapter that the assignee’s acts or omissions: 1. Were outside the scope of his or her duties; 2. Were grossly negligent; or 3. Constitute malfeasance. (4)(a) Except for matters in paragraph (3)(b), any creditor or party in interest seeking to assert a claim against the assignee must look only to the assignment estate assets and any bond posted by the assignee to satisfy any liability, and the assignee is not personally liable to satisfy any such obligation. (b) Any creditor or party in interest seeking to assert a claim against the assignee under paragraph (3)(b) must first obtain leave of the court presiding over the assignment action or proceeding based upon good cause shown. (5) Any claim against the assignee, or any agent or professional of the assignee who assists the assignee in the administration of the estate, must be brought before the discharge of the assignee under s. 727.116 to the extent the claim has accrued and is predicated upon facts that are known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the discharge, at which point all such claims are deemed released and forever barred. (6) This section does not alter or limit any other immunity otherwise held by the assignee or any agent or professional of the assignee who assists the assignee in the administration of the estate.

Conduct discovery as provided under the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure to determine whether to prosecute such claims or causes of actions. 2.

(2) Within 30 days after the filing date, examine the assignor, under oath, concerning the acts, conduct, assets, liabilities, and financial condition of the assignor or any matter related to the assignee’s administration of the estate, unless excused by the court for good cause shown. (3) Give notice to creditors of all matters concerning the administration of the estate, pursuant to s. 727.111. (4) Conduct the business of the assignor for a limited period not to exceed 45 calendar days, if doing so is in the best interest of the estate, or for a longer period if in the best interest of the estate, upon notice and until such time as an objection, if any, is sustained by the court. An assignee’s authorization to conduct the business of the assignor may be extended for a period longer than 45 days upon service of negative notice. If no timely objection is filed with the court, the assignee may continue to operate the assignor’s business for an additional 90 days. The court may extend the 90-day period if it finds an extension to be in the best interest of the estate. (5) To the extent reasonable in the exercise of the assignee’s business judgment, reject an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property or of personal property under which the assignor is the lessee. (6) To the extent reasonable and necessary, pay administrative expenses of the estate, subject, however, to s. 727.114(1).

(8) Keep regular accounts and furnish such information concerning the estate as may be reasonably requested by creditors or other parties in interest. (9) File with the court an interim report of receipts and disbursements within 6 months after the filing date unless excused by the court or unless the estate has been sooner distributed in full. (10) Examine the validity and priority of all claims against the estate. (11) Abandon assets to duly perfected secured or lien creditors, where, after due investigation, he or she determines that the estate has no equity in such assets or such assets are burdensome to the estate or are of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate. (12) Pay dividends and secured or priority claims as often as is compatible with the best interests of the estate and close the estate as expeditiously as possible.

(4) If all claims subject to distribution under this section have been paid in full, any residue shall be paid to the assignor. History.—s. 14, ch. 87-174; s. 12, ch. 2007-185; s. 21, ch. 2008-187.
