The amount of the late fee and the conditions for imposing such fee must be stated in the rental agreement or in an addendum to such agreement. For purposes of this subsection, a late fee of $20, or 20 percent of the monthly rent, whichever is greater, is reasonable and does not constitute a penalty. In addition to late fees, a facility or unit owner may also charge a tenant a reasonable fee for any expenses incurred as a result of rent collection or lien enforcement.History.—s. 6, ch. 82-151; s. 3, ch. 2012-175; s. 2, ch. 2017-82.",
