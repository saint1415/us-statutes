      "text": "337.0261 Construction aggregate materials.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—“Construction aggregate materials” means crushed stone, limestone, dolomite, limerock, shell rock, cemented coquina, sand for use as a component of mortars, concrete, bituminous mixtures, or underdrain filters, and other mined resources providing the basic material for concrete, asphalt, and road base. (2) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—The Legislature finds that there is a strategic and critical need for an available supply of construction aggregate materials within the state and that a disruption of the supply would cause a significant detriment to the state’s construction industry, transportation system, and overall health, safety, and welfare. In addition, the Legislature recognizes that construction aggregate materials mining is an industry of critical importance to the state and that the mining of construction aggregate materials is in the public interest. (3) LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISIONMAKING.—A local government may not approve or deny a proposed land use zoning change, comprehensive plan amendment, land use permit, ordinance, or order regarding construction aggregate materials without considering any information provided by the Department of Transportation regarding the effect such change, amendment, permit decision, ordinance, or order would have on the availability, transportation, cost, and potential extraction of construction aggregate materials on the local area, the region, and the state. The failure of the Department of Transportation to provide this information shall not be a basis for delay or invalidation of the local government action. A local government may not impose a moratorium, or combination of moratoria, of more than 12 months’ duration on the mining or extraction of construction aggregate materials, commencing on the date the vote was taken to impose the moratorium. January 1, 2007, shall serve as the commencement of the 12-month period for moratoria already in place as of July 1, 2007. (4) EXPEDITED PERMITTING.—Due to the state’s critical infrastructure needs and the potential shortfall in available construction aggregate materials, limerock environmental resource permitting and reclamation applications filed after March 1, 2007, are eligible for the expedited permitting processes contained in s. 403.973. Challenges to state agency action in the expedited permitting process for establishment of a limerock mine in this state under s. 403.973 are subject to the same requirements as challenges brought under s. 403.973(14)(a), except that, notwithstanding s. 120.574, summary proceedings must be conducted within 30 days after a party files the motion for summary hearing, regardless of whether the parties agree to the summary proceeding.

(2) For purposes of this section, the term “small business” means a business with yearly average gross receipts of less than $25 million for road and bridge contracts and less than $10 million for professional and nonprofessional services contracts. A business’ average gross receipts is determined by averaging its annual gross receipts over the last 3 years, including the receipts of any affiliate as defined in s. 337.165.

(2) Each contract for construction or maintenance entered into pursuant to this chapter shall provide for final payment within 75 days of final field acceptance, provided all documents which are required by the contract from the contractor, with the exception of the acceptance letter and a consent by the contractor’s surety for release of payment of the retained percentage and final estimate to the contractor, are received within 30 days of final field acceptance. If the contractor fails to provide the documents within 30 days after final field acceptance, payment shall be made within 45 days of receipt by the department of such documents. The department shall notify the contractor within 20 days of receipt of the documents which are required for payment if such documents are incomplete and shall specifically list for the contractor which documents have not been submitted. Should the department fail to notify the contractor within 20 days, regardless of completeness of the documents, the time required for payment shall begin. The period of time from the offer of final payment to the receipt by the department of the acceptance letter and surety’s consent shall not count as part of the 75-day or 45-day time periods. Final payment shall not be so made as to any amount which is in dispute or the subject of a pending claim, but shall be so made as to that portion of a contract or those amounts which are not in dispute or the subject of a pending claim. However, such partial payment shall not constitute any bar, admission, or estoppel or have any other effect as to those payments that are in dispute or the subject of a pending claim. No payment may be made to a construction or maintenance contractor until the department has on file proof, in the form of a notarized affidavit from the contractor, that all motor vehicles that he or she operates in this state are registered in compliance with chapter 320. (3) For each day after 75 days, or 30 days after settlement of a claim, the department shall pay to the contractor interest at the rate set forth in s. 55.03. (4) If a contractor fails to submit all documents required for final payment within 2 years after final acceptance of the work or within 1 year after the offer by the department of final payment, whichever occurs later, any amount owed as final payment shall be considered to be forfeited. The forfeiture will not apply to documents that are the subject of existing claims or pending legal proceedings. Written notice shall be given by the department at least 60 days prior to forfeiture.

(b) “Contractor” means a person or firm having a contract for rendering services to the department relating to the construction or maintenance of a transportation facility. (c) “Final acceptance” means that the contractor has completely performed the work provided for under the contract, the department or its agent has determined that the contractor has satisfactorily completed the work provided for under the contract, and the department or its agent has submitted written notice of final acceptance to the contractor. (3) Every claim in an amount of up to $250,000 per contract that could not be resolved by negotiation between the department and the contractor must be arbitrated by the board. An award issued by the board pursuant to this section is final and enforceable by a court of law. (4) The contractor may submit a claim greater than $250,000 up to $2 million per contract or, upon agreement of the parties, greater than $2 million per contract to be arbitrated by the board. An award issued by the board pursuant to this subsection is final if a request for a trial de novo is not filed within the time provided by Rule 1.830, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. At the trial de novo, the court may not admit evidence that there has been an arbitration proceeding, the nature or amount of the award, or any other matter concerning the conduct of the arbitration proceeding, except that testimony given in connection with an arbitration hearing may be used for any purpose otherwise permitted by the Florida Evidence Code. If a request for trial de novo is not filed within the time provided, the award issued by the board is final and enforceable by a court of law. (5) An arbitration request may not be made to the board before final acceptance but must be made to the board within 820 days after final acceptance. An arbitration request related to a warranty notice provided by the department must be made to the board within 360 days after such notice or 820 days after final acceptance, whichever is later. (6) The board shall schedule a hearing within 45 days after an arbitration request and, if possible, shall conduct the hearing within 90 days after the request. The board may administer oaths and conduct the proceedings as provided by the rules of the court. The hearing shall be conducted informally. Presentation of testimony and evidence shall be kept to a minimum, and matters shall be presented to the arbitrators primarily through the statements and arguments of counsel. The board shall address the scope of discovery, presentation of testimony, and evidence at a preliminary hearing by considering the size, subject matter, and complexity of the dispute. Any party to the arbitration may petition the board, for good cause shown, to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, documents, and other evidence at the arbitration and may petition the board for orders compelling such attendance and production at the arbitration. Subpoenas shall be served and are enforceable in the manner provided by law. (7) The board must issue an award within 45 days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. If all three members of the board do not agree, the award agreed to by the majority shall constitute the award of the board. (8) The board shall be composed of three members. The first member shall be appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, and the second member shall be elected by those construction or maintenance companies that are under contract with the department. The third member shall be chosen by agreement of the first and second members. If the first or second member has a conflict of interest regarding affiliation with one of the parties to an arbitration hearing, the appointing entity shall appoint an alternate member for that hearing. If the third member has such a conflict of interest, the first and second members shall select an alternate member. Each member shall serve a 4-year term. The board shall elect a chair for each term, who shall be the administrator of the board and custodian of its records. (9) The presence of all board members is required to conduct a meeting in person or via videoconferencing. (10) The members of the board shall receive compensation for the performance of their duties from deposits made by the parties based on an estimate of compensation by the board, except that an employee of the department may not receive compensation from the board. All deposits will be held in escrow by the chair in advance of the hearing. Each member eligible for compensation shall be compensated at $200 per hour, up to a maximum of $1,500 per day. A member shall be reimbursed for the actual cost of his or her travel expenses. The board may allocate funds annually for clerical and other administrative services. (11) To cover the cost of administration and initial compensation of the board, the party requesting arbitration shall pay a filing fee to the board, according to a schedule established by the board, of: (a) Up to $500 for a claim that is $25,000 or less. (b) Up to $1,000 for a claim that is more than $25,000 but is $50,000 or less. (c) Up to $1,500 for a claim that is more than $50,000 but is $100,000 or less. (d) Up to $2,000 for a claim that is more than $100,000 but is $200,000 or less. (e) Up to $3,000 for a claim that is more than $200,000 but is $300,000 or less. (f) Up to $4,000 for a claim that is more than $300,000 but is $400,000 or less. (g) Up to $5,000 for a claim that is more than $400,000. The board may apportion the filing fees and the cost of recording and preparing a transcript of the hearing among the parties in its award.

      "text": "337.195 Limits on liability.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Contract documents” has the same meaning as in the applicable contract between the department and the contractor. (b) “Contractor” means a person or an entity, at any contractual tier, including any member of a design-build team pursuant to s. 337.11, who constructs, maintains, or repairs a highway, road, street, bridge, or other transportation facility for the department in connection with a department project. (c) “Design engineer” means a person or an entity, including the design consultant of a design-build team, who contracts at any tier to prepare or provide engineering plans, including traffic control plans, for the construction or repair of a highway, road, street, bridge, or other department transportation facility for the department or in connection with a department project. (d) “Traffic control plans” means the maintenance of traffic plans designed by a professional engineer, or otherwise in accordance with the department’s standard plans, and approved by the department. (2) In a civil action for the death of or injury to a person, or for damage to property, against the department or its agents, consultants, or contractors for work performed on a highway, road, street, bridge, or other transportation facility when the death, injury, or damage resulted from a motor vehicle crash within a construction zone in which the driver of one of the vehicles was under the influence of alcoholic beverages as set forth in s. 316.193, under the influence of any chemical substance as set forth in s. 877.111, under the influence of marijuana as authorized by s. 381.986, excluding low-THC cannabis, or illegally under the influence of any substance controlled under chapter 893 to the extent that her or his normal faculties were impaired or that she or he operated a vehicle recklessly as defined in s. 316.192, it is presumed that the driver’s operation of the vehicle was the sole proximate cause of her or his own death, injury, or damage. This presumption can be overcome if the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the department, or of its agents, consultants, or contractors, was a proximate cause of the driver’s death, injury, or damage. (3) A contractor who constructs, maintains, or repairs a highway, road, street, bridge, or other transportation facility for the department is not liable to a claimant for personal injury, property damage, or death arising from the performance of the construction, maintenance, or repair if, at the time of the personal injury, property damage, or death, the contractor was in compliance with contract documents material to the condition that was the proximate cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death. (a) The limitations on liability contained in this subsection do not apply when the proximate cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death is a latent condition, defect, error, or omission that was created by the contractor and not a defect, error, or omission in the contract documents; or when the proximate cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death was the contractor’s failure to comply with the traffic control plans as required by the contract documents. (b) This subsection may not be interpreted or construed as relieving the contractor of any obligation to provide the department with written notice of any apparent error or omission in the contract documents. (c) This subsection may not be interpreted or construed to alter or affect any claim of the department against such contractor. (d) This subsection does not affect any claim of any entity against such contractor, which claim is associated with such entity’s facilities on or in department roads or other transportation facilities. (4) In all cases involving personal injury, property damage, or death, a design engineer is presumed to have prepared engineering plans using the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised by other engineers in the field under similar conditions and in similar localities and with due regard for acceptable engineering standards and principles if the engineering plans conformed to the department’s design standards material to the condition or defect that was the proximate cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death. This presumption can be overcome only upon a showing of the design engineer’s gross negligence in the preparation of the engineering plans and may not be interpreted or construed to alter or affect any claim of the department against such design engineer. The limitation on liability contained in this subsection does not apply to any hidden or undiscoverable condition created by the design engineer. This subsection does not affect any claim of any entity against such design engineer, which claim is associated with such entity’s facilities on or in department roads or other transportation facilities. (5) If, in any civil action for death, injury, or damages, the department or a contractor or design engineer is determined to be immune from liability pursuant to this section, the department, contractor, or design engineer may not be named on the jury verdict form or be found to be at fault or responsible for the injury, death, or damage that gave rise to the damages for the theory of liability from which the department, contractor, or design engineer was found to be immune.

(b) Traffic congestion and facility overcrowding on the State Highway System constitutes a serious and growing problem; impedes the development of an effective transportation system; results in increased incidents of traffic accidents, personal injury, and property damage or loss; causes environmental degradation; impedes sound economic growth; impairs effective growth management, including the ability to meet concurrency requirements and coordinate land use decisions and transportation planning; discourages tourism; aggravates social discord; increases maintenance costs; shortens the effective life of the transportation facility; delays public evacuation for natural storms and emergencies; impairs national defense and disaster response readiness; delays response time for emergency vehicles; significantly increases public infrastructure needs and associated public costs, such as police, fire, accident, medical, and hospital costs; and otherwise is injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare. (c) The designation and management of transportation corridors and the planning and development of transportation facilities within transportation corridors will substantially assist in allowing government to alleviate traffic congestion and transportation facility overcrowding, aid in the development of an effective transportation system that is coordinated with land use planning, assist in planning for future growth, enable compliance with concurrency requirements, and alleviate the heretofore described health, safety, and welfare liabilities to the public. (d) The designation and management of transportation corridors can best be achieved through the inclusion of transportation corridors in the local government comprehensive plans that are developed, reviewed, and adopted pursuant to chapter 163, in order to ensure comprehensive planning for future development and growth, improved coordination between land use and transportation planning, and compliance with concurrency requirements. (2) It is further found and declared that: (a) Investments in transportation corridors cannot be adequately coordinated with land use decisions without timely preservation, management, or acquisition of property necessary to accommodate existing and planned transportation facilities within the corridor. (b) The inability to timely protect or acquire property necessary to accommodate a transportation facility in a transportation corridor constitutes an economic, health, safety, and welfare liability that imposes increasingly onerous burdens on public revenues, seriously impedes the ability to plan for future growth, substantially impairs or arrests sound growth, impedes the provision of transportation infrastructure concurrent with the impact of development, retards the provision of an adequate transportation system for the people in the state, aggravates traffic problems, and substantially hampers the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities. (c) When development, building, or other intensification of land uses occur within the area of right-of-way needed for transportation facilities, the subsequent public acquisition of property results in disruption of neighborhoods, residences, and businesses; relocation of people and property; interference with utility facilities; and substantial additional costs to property owners, business owners, and public agencies for services, planning, permitting, and zoning. (d) The prevention and elimination of traffic congestion on the State Highway System and the protection, management, and early acquisition of property to accommodate future transportation facilities is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state, counties, and municipalities shall not continue to consume an excessive proportion of limited resources on the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization, and other forms of public protection services and facilities as a result of inadequate transportation facilities. (3) It is the intent of the Legislature that governmental police powers be utilized to the greatest extent possible by each governmental entity, and by two or more entities through corridor management agreements, to manage land uses necessary for transportation corridors; that property acquisition by donation, purchase, or eminent domain occur as far in advance of construction need as possible; and that property, needed to manage transportation corridors, be acquired and retained for future use to avoid the public liabilities for health, safety, and welfare heretofore outlined. (4) It is recognized by the Legislature that advance acquisition of property to manage land uses in transportation corridors for future use will, of necessity, require acquisition without design plans and profiles, project development, and construction information; and it is intended by the Legislature that such advance acquisition, including acquisition utilizing the power of eminent domain, must nevertheless occur to avoid the social, economic, health, safety, and welfare liabilities heretofore declared. (5) When lands and property in a transportation corridor are acquired pursuant to the eminent domain powers granted by s. 337.27(1), public purpose and necessity may be demonstrated through the use of typical design, construction plans or profiles, and one or more of the following: anticipated trends in such areas as demographic and other growth patterns, land use and development patterns, traffic projections, expected utility needs, or future anticipated mass-transit requirements. Immediate availability of construction funds and applicable permits shall not be required to support such showing of public purpose and necessity. (6) A local government may designate a transportation corridor by including the corridor in the entity’s comprehensive plan traffic circulation or transportation element. A transportation management ordinance may be adopted for designated transportation corridors. The transportation corridor management ordinance should contain the criteria to manage the land uses within and adjacent to the transportation corridor, the types of restrictions on nonresidential and residential construction within the designated corridor, identification of permitted land uses within the designated corridor, a public notification process, a variance and appeal process, and an intergovernmental coordination process that provides for the coordinated management of transportation corridors that cross jurisdictional boundaries with the plans of adjacent jurisdictions. Local governments may adopt such additional ordinances and regulations as necessary to manage designated transportation corridors. History.—s. 20, ch. 88-168; s. 110, ch. 92-152; s. 41, ch. 95-257.

The work must be completed within such reasonable time as stated in the notice or such time as agreed to by the authority and the utility owner. (a) If the relocation of utility facilities, as referred to in s. 111 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, Pub. L. No. 84-627, is necessitated by the construction of a project on the federal-aid interstate system, including extensions thereof within urban areas, and the cost of the project is eligible and approved for reimbursement by the Federal Government to the extent of 90 percent or more under the Federal-Aid Highway Act, or any amendment thereof, then in that event the utility owning or operating such facilities must perform any necessary work upon notice from the department, and the state must pay the entire expense properly attributable to such work after deducting therefrom any increase in the value of a new facility and any salvage value derived from an old facility. (b) When a joint agreement between the department and the utility is executed for utility work to be accomplished as part of a contract for construction of a transportation facility, the department may participate in those utility work costs that exceed the department’s official estimate of the cost of the work by more than 10 percent. The amount of such participation is limited to the difference between the official estimate of all the work in the joint agreement plus 10 percent and the amount awarded for this work in the construction contract for such work. The department may not participate in any utility work costs that occur as a result of changes or additions during the course of the contract. (c) When an agreement between the department and utility is executed for utility work to be accomplished in advance of a contract for construction of a transportation facility, the department may participate in the cost of clearing and grubbing necessary to perform such work. (d) If the utility facility was initially installed to exclusively serve the authority or its tenants, or both, the authority must bear the costs of the utility work. However, the authority is not responsible for the cost of utility work related to any subsequent additions to that facility for the purpose of serving others. For a county or municipality, if such utility facility was installed in the right-of-way as a means to serve a county or municipal facility on a parcel of property adjacent to the right-of-way and if the intended use of the county or municipal facility is for a use other than transportation purposes, the obligation of the county or municipality to bear the costs of the utility work shall extend only to utility work on the parcel of property on which the facility of the county or municipality originally served by the utility facility is located. (e) If, under an agreement between a utility and the authority entered into after July 1, 2009, the utility conveys, subordinates, or relinquishes a compensable property right to the authority for the purpose of accommodating the acquisition or use of the right-of-way by the authority, without the agreement expressly addressing future responsibility for the cost of necessary utility work, the authority must bear the cost of removal or relocation. This paragraph does not impair or restrict, and may not be used to interpret, the terms of any such agreement entered into before July 1, 2009. (f) If the utility is an electric facility being relocated underground in order to enhance vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian safety and in which ownership of the electric facility to be placed underground has been transferred from a private to a public utility within the past 5 years, the department must incur all costs of the necessary utility work. (g) An authority may bear the costs of utility work required to eliminate an unreasonable interference when the utility is not able to establish that it has a compensable property right in the particular property where the utility is located if: 1. The utility was physically located on the particular property before the authority acquired rights in the property; 2. The utility demonstrates that it has a compensable property right in adjacent properties along the alignment of the utility or, after due diligence, certifies that the utility does not have evidence to prove or disprove that it has a compensable property right in the particular property where the utility is located; and 3. The information available to the authority does not establish the relative priorities of the authority’s and the utility’s interests in the particular property. (h) If a municipally owned utility or county-owned utility is located in a rural area of opportunity, as defined in s. 288.0656(2), and the department determines that the utility is unable, and will not be able within the next 10 years, to pay for the cost of utility work necessitated by a department project on the State Highway System, the department may pay, in whole or in part, the cost of such utility work performed by the department or its contractor. (i) If the relocation of utility facilities is necessitated by the construction of a commuter rail service project or an intercity passenger rail service project and the cost of the project is eligible and approved for reimbursement by the Federal Government, then in that event the utility owning or operating such facilities located by permit on a department-owned rail corridor must perform any necessary utility relocation work upon notice from the department, and the department must pay the expense properly attributable to such utility relocation work in the same proportion as federal funds are expended on the commuter rail service project or an intercity passenger rail service project after deducting therefrom any increase in the value of a new facility and any salvage value derived from an old facility. In no event is the state required to use state dollars for such utility relocation work. This paragraph does not apply to any phase of the Central Florida Commuter Rail project, known as SunRail. (j) If a utility is lawfully located within an existing and valid utility easement granted by recorded plat, regardless of whether such land was subsequently acquired by the authority by dedication, transfer of fee, or otherwise, the authority must bear the cost of the utility work required to eliminate an unreasonable interference. The authority shall pay the entire expense properly attributable to such work after deducting any increase in the value of a new facility and any salvage value derived from an old facility. (k) If a county or municipal authority requires a provider of communications services which is subject to chapter 202 to relocate a facility used to provide such communications services, the service provider owning or operating such facility must initiate any necessary work upon notice from the authority. The county or municipal authority requiring such relocation is not responsible for paying the expense of such work, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. The service provider may apply for reimbursement of relocation expenses from the Utility Relocation Reimbursement Grant Program pursuant to s. 337.4031, subject to the availability of funds and in compliance with the requirements of the program. If funds are not available, the county or municipal authority requiring such relocation remains not responsible for paying the expense of such work, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. (2) If such utility work is incidental to work to be done on such road or publicly owned rail corridor, the notice shall be given at the same time the contract for the work is advertised for bids, or no less than 30 days before the commencement of such work by the authority, whichever occurs later. (3) Whenever a notice from the authority requires such utility work and the owner thereof fails to perform the work at his or her own expense within the time stated in the notice or such other time as agreed to by the authority and the utility owner, the authority shall proceed to cause the utility work to be performed. The expense thereby incurred shall be paid out of any money available therefor, and such expense shall, except as provided in subsection (1), be charged against the owner and levied and collected and paid into the fund from which the expense of such relocation was paid. (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(k), a department shall notify providers of communications services that are subject to chapter 202 which have permitted infrastructure within a planned or existing public right-of-way within 90 days after a project is added to the department’s project schedule which may require the provider to relocate its infrastructure for roadway improvements to increase safety or reduce congestion. For purposes of this subsection, the term “department” means the Department of Transportation or an agency of the state created under chapter 348 or chapter 349. (a) The notification provided under this subsection must include an estimated project schedule and timeline, including the anticipated year of construction. (b) Within 90 days after receipt of the notification, the provider shall respond to the department with an estimated timeframe and project cost for the relocation of the provider’s infrastructure. The response must include a draft relocation schedule within or adjacent to the existing or planned public right-of-way. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department shall provide a reasonable offer for joint participation in relocation costs, so long as the provider initiates work within a mutually agreed upon timeframe and, if the infrastructure relocation is a result of roadway improvements within the public right-of-way to increase safety or reduce congestion and the impacted infrastructure was, at the time of notification under this subsection, installed within the past 7 state fiscal years, the department must incur at least 50 percent of the costs for relocation work as described in a joint participation agreement. (d) This subsection may not be construed to prevent a department from pursuing the additional relocation processes, agreements, or payment options authorized under this section or to prevent a provider from using grant funds provided through other government sources to support all or a portion of the relocation costs.
