      "text": "186.002 Findings and intent.— (1) The Legislature finds and declares that: (a) The issues of public safety, education, health care, community and economic development and redevelopment, protection and conservation of natural and historic resources, transportation, and public facilities transcend the boundaries and responsibilities of individual units of government, and often no single unit of government can plan or implement policies to deal with these issues without affecting other units of government. (b) Coordination among all levels of government is necessary to ensure effective and efficient delivery of governmental services to all the citizens of the state. It is therefore necessary to establish an integrated planning system and to ensure coordinated administration of government policies that address the multitude of issues posed by the state’s continued growth and development. (c) To promote intergovernmental coordination and the effective allocation of resources, the state should set goals to provide direction and guidance for state, regional, and local governments and agencies in the development and implementation of their respective plans, programs, and services. The preservation and enhancement of the quality of life of the people of this state require that a state comprehensive plan be adopted by the Legislature to provide policy direction for all state and regional agencies and local governments. (d) Regular evaluation of the state comprehensive plan is necessary to inform the public whether state goals are being attained. To accomplish this purpose, the state comprehensive plan should be evaluated biennially with any necessary revisions prepared through coordinated action by state and regional agencies and local governments. (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that: (a) The state planning process provide direction for the delivery of governmental services, a means for defining and achieving the specific goals and objectives of the state, and a method for evaluating the accomplishment of those goals and objectives. (b) The state comprehensive plan shall provide basic policy direction to all levels of government regarding the orderly social, economic, and physical growth of the state. (c) Long-range program plans shall be effectively coordinated to ensure the establishment of appropriate agency priorities and facilitate the orderly, positive management of agency activities consistent with the public interest. It is also intended that the implementation of state and regional plans enhance the quality of life of the citizens of the state. (d) The state planning process shall be informed and guided by the experience of public officials at all levels of government. (e) All agencies and levels of government involved in the integrated planning process shall provide sufficient opportunities for meaningful public participation in the preparation, implementation, evaluation, and revision of all plans and programs.

      "text": "186.007 State comprehensive plan; preparation; revision.— (1) The Executive Office of the Governor shall prepare a proposed state comprehensive plan which provides long-range guidance for the orderly social, economic, and physical growth of the state. The plan shall be composed of goals, objectives, and policies that are briefly stated in plain, easily understandable words and that give specific policy direction to state and regional agencies. The goals, objectives, and policies shall be statewide in scope and shall be consistent and compatible with each other. The state comprehensive plan shall not include a land use map. (2) In preparing the goals, objectives, and policies of the state comprehensive plan, the Executive Office of the Governor shall analyze the problems, opportunities, and needs associated with growth and development in this state, particularly those problems, opportunities, and needs related to land use, water resources, and transportation system development. The Executive Office of the Governor shall document present conditions and trends, forecast future conditions and trends based on expected growth patterns, and identify needs. Such conditions, trends, and needs shall be used to prepare goals, objectives, and policies designed to preserve and enhance the quality of life of the citizens of this state. (3) In the state comprehensive plan, the Executive Office of the Governor may include goals, objectives, and policies related to the following program areas: economic opportunities; agriculture; employment; public safety; education; health concerns; social welfare concerns; housing and community development; natural resources and environmental management; energy; global climate change; recreational and cultural opportunities; historic preservation; transportation; and governmental direction and support services. (4)(a) The Executive Office of the Governor shall prepare statewide goals, objectives, and policies related to the opportunities, problems, and needs associated with growth and development in this state, which goals, objectives, and policies shall constitute the growth management portion of the state comprehensive plan. In preparing the growth management goals, objectives, and policies, the Executive Office of the Governor initially shall emphasize the management of land use, water resources, and transportation system development. (b) The purpose of the growth management portion of the state comprehensive plan is to establish clear, concise, and direct goals, objectives, and policies related to land development, water resources, transportation, and related topics. In doing so, the plan should, where possible, draw upon the work that agencies have invested in the Florida Transportation Plan, the Florida water plan, and similar planning documents. (5)(a) The Executive Office of the Governor shall prepare a separate portion of the state comprehensive plan related to the long-term infrastructure and capital outlay needs of the state. This portion shall be prepared based upon a comprehensive assessment of needs conducted by the Executive Office of the Governor, and it shall be updated annually as part of the budgeting process prescribed by chapter 216. The assessment shall provide estimates by area of the future infrastructure needs of the state that result from expected growth patterns and shall include recommendations for directing state expenditures to particular areas of the state in order to implement the growth management goals, objectives, and policies of the state comprehensive plan. (b) All capital outlay recommendations submitted to the Legislature in the Governor’s budget request must be consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the state comprehensive plan and the long-term infrastructure and capital outlay portion when adopted. (6) The adopted state comprehensive plan shall provide, in addition to other criteria established by law, standards and criteria for the review and approval of state agency strategic plans and strategic regional policy plans. (7) In preparing and revising the state comprehensive plan, the Executive Office of the Governor shall, to the extent feasible, consider studies, reports, and plans of each department, agency, and institution of state and local government, each regional planning agency, and the Federal Government and shall take into account the existing and prospective resources, capabilities, and needs of state and local levels of government. (8) The revision of the state comprehensive plan is a continuing process. Each section of the plan shall be reviewed and analyzed biennially by the Executive Office of the Governor in conjunction with the planning officers of other state agencies significantly affected by the provisions of the particular section under review. In conducting this review and analysis, the Executive Office of the Governor shall review and consider, with the assistance of the state land planning agency and regional planning councils, the evaluation and appraisal reports prepared pursuant to s. 186.511. Any necessary revisions of the state comprehensive plan shall be proposed by the Governor in a written report and be accompanied by an explanation of the need for such changes. If the Governor determines that changes are unnecessary, the written report must explain why changes are unnecessary. The proposed revisions and accompanying explanations may be submitted in the report required by s. 186.031. Any proposed revisions to the plan shall be submitted to the Legislature as provided in s. 186.008(2) at least 30 days prior to the regular legislative session occurring in each even-numbered year.

(b) There is a need for regional planning agencies to assist local governments to resolve their common problems, engage in areawide comprehensive and functional planning, administer certain federal and state grants-in-aid, and provide a regional focus in regard to multiple programs undertaken on an areawide basis. (c) Federal and state programs should have coordinated purposes and consistent policy direction in order to avoid the proliferation of overlapping, duplicating, and competing regional agencies. To further this end, these efforts should result in 1 entities agencies which effectively carry out a wide variety of federal and state program designations. (d) The financial and technical assistance of the state should be provided to regional planning agencies to maximize the effective use of regional programs undertaken with the authorization of local, state, or federal governments serving the citizens of this state. (e) There is a need for the establishment at the regional level of clear policy plans that will guide broad-based representative regional planning agencies as they undertake regional review functions. (2) It is the declared purpose of this act to establish a common system of regional planning councils for areawide coordination and related cooperative activities of federal, state, and local governments; ensure a broad-based regional organization that can provide a truly regional perspective; and enhance the ability and opportunity of local governments to resolve issues and problems transcending their individual boundaries. (3) The regional planning council is designated as the primary organization to address problems and plan solutions that are of greater-than-local concern or scope, and the regional planning council shall be recognized by local governments as one of the means to provide input into state policy development. (4) The regional planning council is recognized as Florida’s only multipurpose regional entity that is in a position to plan for and coordinate intergovernmental solutions to growth-related problems on greater-than-local issues, provide technical assistance to local governments, and meet other needs of the communities in each region. A council shall not act as a permitting or regulatory entity. (5) The regional planning council shall have a duty to assist local governments with activities designed to promote and facilitate economic development in the geographic area covered by the council.

The remaining one-third of the voting members on the governing board shall be appointed by the Governor, to include one elected school board member, subject to confirmation by the Senate, and shall reside in the region. No two appointees of the Governor shall have their places of residence in the same county until each county within the region is represented by a Governor’s appointee to the governing board. Nothing contained in this section shall deny to local governing bodies or the Governor the option of appointing either locally elected officials or lay citizens provided at least two-thirds of the governing body of the regional planning council is composed of locally elected officials. (4) In addition to voting members appointed pursuant to paragraph (2)(c), the Governor shall appoint the following ex officio nonvoting members to each regional planning council: (a) A representative of the Department of Transportation.

      "text": "186.507 Strategic regional policy plans.— (1) A strategic regional policy plan shall contain regional goals and policies that shall address affordable housing, economic development, emergency preparedness, natural resources of regional significance, and regional transportation, and that may address any other subject which relates to the particular needs and circumstances of the comprehensive planning district as determined by the regional planning council. Regional plans shall identify and address significant regional resources and facilities. Regional plans shall be consistent with the state comprehensive plan. (2) The Executive Office of the Governor may adopt by rule minimum criteria to be addressed in each strategic regional policy plan and a uniform format for each plan. Such criteria must emphasize the requirement that each regional planning council, when preparing and adopting a strategic regional policy plan, must focus on regional rather than local resources and facilities. (3) In preparing the strategic regional policy plan, the regional planning council shall seek the full cooperation and assistance of local governments to identify key regional resources and facilities and shall document present conditions and trends with respect to the policy areas addressed; forecast future conditions and trends based on expected growth patterns of the region; and analyze the problems, needs, and opportunities associated with growth and development in the region, especially as those problems, needs, and opportunities relate to the subject areas addressed in the strategic regional policy plan. (4) The regional goals and policies shall be used to develop a coordinated program of regional actions directed at resolving the identified problems and needs. (5) The council shall give consideration to existing state, regional, and local plans in accomplishing the purposes of this section. (6) The draft regional plan shall be circulated to all local governments in the region, and the local governments shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to comment on the regional plan. (7) The council shall provide for adequate input by citizens into the regional planning process. (8) Upon adoption, a strategic regional policy plan shall provide, in addition to other criteria established by law, the basis for regional review of developments of regional impact, regional review of federally assisted projects, and other regional comment functions. (9) Regional planning councils shall consider, and make accessible to the public, appropriate data and studies, including development-of-regional-impact applications and agency reports, in order to assist participants in the development-of-regional-impact review process. A major objective of the regional planning process shall be to coordinate with the state land planning agency in order to achieve uniformity and consistency in land use information and data collection efforts in this state and provide a usable and accessible database to local governments and the private sector. (10) Each regional planning council shall enter into a memorandum of agreement with each local health council in its comprehensive planning district to ensure the coordination of health planning, if the regional planning council elects to address health issues in its strategic regional policy plan. The memorandum of agreement shall specify the manner in which each regional planning council and local health council will coordinate their activities. (11) All natural resources of regional significance identified in the strategic regional policy plan shall be identified by a specific geographic location and not solely by generic type. (12) In addressing regional transportation, the council may recommend minimum density guidelines for development along designated public transportation corridors and identify investment strategies for providing transportation infrastructure where growth is desired, rather than focusing primarily on relieving congestion in areas where growth is discouraged. (13) Standards included in strategic regional policy plans may be used for planning purposes only and not for permitting or regulatory purposes. However, a regional planning council may not adopt a planning standard that differs materially from a planning standard adopted by rule by a state or regional agency, when such rule expressly states the planning standard is intended to preempt action by the regional planning council. The absence of a planning standard for a particular issue on the part of a state or other regional agency shall not be deemed to create a material difference from a planning standard adopted by a regional planning council. Planning standards may be used as a basis for comments on federal consistency and clearinghouse reviews. However, any inconsistency between a local plan or plan amendment and a strategic regional policy plan must not be the sole basis for a notice of intent to find a local plan or plan amendment not in compliance with this act. (14) A regional planning council may not, in its strategic regional policy plan or by any other means, establish binding level-of-service standards for public facilities and services provided or regulated by local governments. This limitation shall not be construed to limit the authority of regional planning councils to propose objections, recommendations, or comments on local plans or plan amendments. (15) A strategic regional policy plan or any amendment thereto shall be adopted by rule by a two-thirds vote of the membership of the governing body of a regional planning council present at a duly noticed meeting constituting a quorum; however, no strategic regional policy plan or amendment thereto shall be adopted by less than the majority of the members of the governing body. (16) In formulating regional policies, the regional planning council shall consider existing requirements in other planning and regulatory programs. (17) Each regional planning council, in its strategic regional policy plan, may recommend specific locations or activities in which a project, due to character or location, should be a development of regional impact within that comprehensive planning district.

      "text": "186.801 Ten-year site plans.— (1) Each electric utility shall submit to the Public Service Commission a 10-year site plan which shall estimate its power-generating needs and the general location of its proposed power plant sites. The 10-year plan shall be reviewed and submitted not less frequently than every 2 years. (2) Within 9 months after the receipt of the proposed plan, the commission shall make a preliminary study of such plan and classify it as “suitable” or “unsuitable.” The commission may suggest alternatives to the plan. All findings of the commission shall be made available to the Department of Environmental Protection for its consideration at any subsequent electrical power plant site certification proceedings. It is recognized that 10-year site plans submitted by an electric utility are tentative information for planning purposes only and may be amended at any time at the discretion of the utility upon written notification to the commission. A complete application for certification of an electrical power plant site under chapter 403, when such site is not designated in the current 10-year site plan of the applicant, shall constitute an amendment to the 10-year site plan. In its preliminary study of each 10-year site plan, the commission shall consider such plan as a planning document and shall review: (a) The need, including the need as determined by the commission, for electrical power in the area to be served. (b) The effect on fuel diversity within the state. (c) The anticipated environmental impact of each proposed electrical power plant site. (d) Possible alternatives to the proposed plan. (e) The views of appropriate local, state, and federal agencies, including the views of the appropriate water management district as to the availability of water and its recommendation as to the use by the proposed plant of salt water or fresh water for cooling purposes. (f) The extent to which the plan is consistent with the state comprehensive plan. (g) The plan with respect to the information of the state on energy availability and consumption. (h) The amount of renewable energy resources the utility produces or purchases. (i) The amount of renewable energy resources the utility plans to produce or purchase over the 10-year planning horizon and the means by which the production or purchases will be achieved. (j) A statement describing how the production and purchase of renewable energy resources impact the utility’s present and future capacity and energy needs. (3) In order to enable it to carry out its duties under this section, the commission may, after hearing, establish a study fee which shall not exceed $1,000 for each proposed plan studied. (4) The commission may adopt rules governing the method of submitting, processing, and studying the 10-year plans as required by this section.
