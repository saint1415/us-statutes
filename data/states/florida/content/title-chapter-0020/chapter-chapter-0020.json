      "text": "1 20.04 Structure of executive branch.—The executive branch of state government is structured as follows: (1) The department is the principal administrative unit of the executive branch. Each department must bear a title beginning with the words “State of Florida” and continuing with “Department of .” (2) For field operations, departments may establish district or area offices that combine division, bureau, section, and subsection functions. (3) For their internal structure, all departments, except for the Department of Financial Services, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Management Services, the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Transportation, must adhere to the following standard terms: (a) The principal unit of the department is the “division.” Each division is headed by a “director.” (b) The principal unit of the division is the “bureau.” Each bureau is headed by a “chief.” (c) The principal unit of the bureau is the “section.” Each section is headed by an “administrator.” (d) If further subdivision is necessary, sections may be divided into “subsections,” which are headed by “supervisors.” (4) Within the Department of Children and Families there are organizational units called “circuits” and “regions.” Each circuit is aligned geographically with each judicial circuit, and each region comprises multiple circuits which are in geographical proximity to each other. (5) Within the Department of Corrections the principal policy and program development unit of the department is the “office.” Each “office” is headed by a director. (6) Within the Department of Transportation the principal policy and program development unit of the department is the “office.” Each “office” is headed by a director. (7)(a) Unless specifically authorized by law, the head of a department may not reallocate duties and functions specifically assigned by law to a specific unit of the department. Those functions or agencies assigned generally to the department without specific designation to a unit of the department may be allocated and reallocated to a unit of the department at the discretion of the head of the department. (b) Within the limitations of this subsection, the head of the department may recommend the establishment of additional divisions, bureaus, sections, and subsections of the department to promote efficient and effective operation of the department. However, additional divisions, or offices in the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Transportation, may be established only by specific statutory enactment. New bureaus, sections, and subsections of departments may be initiated by a department and established as recommended by the Department of Management Services and approved by the Executive Office of the Governor, or may be established by specific statutory enactment. (c) For the purposes of such recommendations and approvals, the Department of Management Services and the Executive Office of the Governor, respectively, must adopt and apply specific criteria for assessing the appropriateness of all reorganization requests from agencies. The criteria must be applied to future agency requests for reorganization and must be used to review the appropriateness of bureaus currently in existence. Any current bureau that does not meet the criteria for a bureau must be reorganized into a section or other appropriate unit. (8) The Executive Office of the Governor must maintain a current organizational chart of each agency of the executive branch, which must identify all divisions, bureaus, units, and subunits of the agency. Agencies must submit such organizational charts in accordance with guidelines established by the Executive Office of the Governor.

The head of a department may determine the amount of the bond and must approve the bond. In determining the amount of the bond, the head of the department may consider the amount of money or property likely to be in custody of the officer or employee at any one time. The premiums for the bonds must be paid out of the funds of the department.

IV of the State Constitution, and to promote quality management and accountability as required in s. 19, Art. III of the State Constitution, all programs, functions, and entities must be reviewed by the executive and the legislative branches. The review must identify and examine the purpose of each program, function, or entity to ensure that each program, function, or entity is administered in the most effective and efficient manner possible, and to assess the public benefit derived from the program, function, or entity. Reviews must determine whether the function, program, or entity: (a) Serves an identifiable purpose that benefits the public and accomplishes the purpose for which it was created; (b) Operates efficiently and effectively within its statutory framework, and whether there are any statutory changes that would likely increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the function, program, or entity; (c) Is necessary to the public health, safety, or welfare, and what would be the effect of its abolition; (d) Serves a beneficial purpose to state agencies in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations of the state; (e) Directly or indirectly increases or decreases the costs of any goods or services, and whether any identified increase in cost is more harmful to the state than any of the harm that could occur absent the function, program, or entity; (f) Is situated within an organizational structure that promotes its efficient and effective administration and does not duplicate activities conducted in other agencies of the state; and (g) Could be assigned to another state agency or to private enterprise, and if so, the most efficient way of doing so. (2) Unless other criteria are specifically provided by law, any review of a function, program, or entity scheduled for repeal by law must be conducted in accordance with the criteria specified in subsection (1). In conducting a review of a function, program, or entity scheduled for repeal, the presumption is in favor of the repeal. The need for or benefits derived from a program, function, or entity subject to repeal and prior review must be compelling as measured by these criteria for the function, program, or entity to be continued.

(d) At the conclusion of each audit, the inspector general shall submit preliminary findings and recommendations to the person responsible for supervision of the program function or operational unit who shall respond to any adverse findings within 20 working days after receipt of the preliminary findings. Such response and the inspector general’s rebuttal to the response shall be included in the final audit report.

No later than 6 months after the Auditor General or the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability publishes a report on the state agency, the inspector general shall provide a written response to the agency head or, for state agencies under the jurisdiction of the Governor, the Chief Inspector General on the status of corrective actions taken. The inspector general shall file a copy of such response with the Legislative Auditing Committee. (i) The inspector general shall develop long-term and annual audit plans based on the findings of periodic risk assessments. The plan, where appropriate, should include postaudit samplings of payments and accounts. The plan shall show the individual audits to be conducted during each year and related resources to be devoted to the respective audits. The plan shall include a specific cybersecurity audit plan. The Chief Financial Officer, to assist in fulfilling the responsibilities for examining, auditing, and settling accounts, claims, and demands pursuant to s. 17.03(1), and examining, auditing, adjusting, and settling accounts pursuant to s. 17.04, may use audits performed by the inspectors general and internal auditors. For state agencies under the jurisdiction of the Governor, the audit plans shall be submitted to the Chief Inspector General. The plan shall be submitted to the agency head for approval. A copy of the approved plan shall be submitted to the Auditor General. (7) In carrying out the investigative duties and responsibilities specified in this section, each inspector general shall initiate, conduct, supervise, and coordinate investigations designed to detect, deter, prevent, and eradicate fraud, waste, mismanagement, misconduct, and other abuses in state government.

Such response and the inspector general’s rebuttal to the response, if any, shall be included in the final investigative report. (f) Submit in a timely fashion final reports on investigations conducted by the inspector general to the agency head, except for whistle-blower’s investigations, which shall be conducted and reported pursuant to s. 112.3189. (8)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), each inspector general shall, not later than September 30 of each year, prepare an annual report summarizing the activities of the office during the immediately preceding state fiscal year.

(4)(a) As used in this section, the term “pecuniary factor” means a factor that the citizen support organization or direct-support organization prudently determines is expected to have a material effect on the risk or returns of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons consistent with applicable investment objectives and funding policy. The term does not include the consideration of the furtherance of any social, political, or ideological interests. (b) Notwithstanding any other law, when deciding whether to invest and when investing funds on behalf of an agency, the citizen support organization or direct-support organization must make decisions based solely on pecuniary factors and may not subordinate the interests of the people of this state to other objectives, including sacrificing investment return or undertaking additional investment risk to promote any nonpecuniary factor. The weight given to any pecuniary factor must appropriately reflect a prudent assessment of its impact on risk or returns. (5) Any contract between an agency and a citizen support organization or direct-support organization must be contingent upon the organization’s submission and posting of information pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) and must include a provision for the orderly cessation of operations and reversion to the state of state funds held in trust by the organization within 30 days after its authorizing statute is repealed, the contract is terminated, or the organization is dissolved.

Such a transfer does not affect the validity of any judicial or administrative proceeding pending on the day of the transfer, and any agency or department to which are transferred the powers, duties, and functions relating to the pending proceeding must be substituted as a party in interest for the proceeding. The transfers provided herein are intended to supplement but not supplant the requirements of s. 6, Art. III of the State Constitution. The definitions provided in s. 20.03 apply to this section, and the types of transfers are defined as follows: (1) TYPE ONE TRANSFER.—A type one transfer is the transferring intact of an existing agency or department so that the agency or department becomes a unit of another agency or a department. Any agency or department transferred to another agency or department by a type one transfer will exercise its powers, duties, and functions as prescribed by law, subject to review and approval by, and under the direct supervision of, the head of the agency or department to which the transfer is made, unless otherwise provided by law. Any agency or department transferred by a type one transfer has all its statutory powers, duties, and functions, and its records, personnel, property, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds transferred to the agency or department to which it is transferred. The transfer of segregated funds must be made in such manner that the relation between program and revenue source as provided by law is retained. Unless otherwise provided by law, the administrative rules of any agency or department involved in the transfer which are in effect immediately before the transfer remain in effect until specifically changed in the manner provided by law. (2) TYPE TWO TRANSFER.—A type two transfer is the merging into another agency or department of an existing agency or department or a program, activity, or function thereof or, if certain identifiable units or subunits, programs, activities, or functions are removed from the existing agency or department, or are abolished, it is the merging into an agency or department of the existing agency or department with the certain identifiable units or subunits, programs, activities, or functions removed therefrom or abolished. (a) Any agency or department or a program, activity, or function thereof transferred by a type two transfer has all its statutory powers, duties, and functions, and its records, personnel, property, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds, except those transferred elsewhere or abolished, transferred to the agency or department to which it is transferred, unless otherwise provided by law. The transfer of segregated funds must be made in such a manner that the relation between program and revenue source as provided by law is retained. (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, the head of the agency or department to which an existing agency or department or a program, activity, or function thereof is transferred is authorized to establish units or subunits to which the agency or department is assigned, and to assign administrative authority for identifiable programs, activities, or functions, to the extent authorized in this chapter.
