Before filing an action for damages under this section, the person claiming injury must make a written demand for $200 or the treble damage amount of the person liable for damages under this section. If the person to whom a written demand is made complies with such demand within 30 days after receipt of the demand, that person shall be given a written release from further civil liability for the specific act of theft or exploitation by the person making the written demand. Any person who has a cause of action under this section may recover the damages allowed under this section from the parents or legal guardian of any unemancipated minor who lives with his or her parents or legal guardian and who is liable for damages under this section.

(4) The death of an elderly or disabled person does not cause the court to lose jurisdiction of any claim for relief for theft or exploitation when the victim of the theft or exploitation is an elderly or disabled person. (5) In a civil action under this section in which an elderly or disabled person is a party, the elderly or disabled person may move the court to advance the trial on the docket. The presiding judge, after consideration of the age and health of the party, may advance the trial on the docket. The motion may be filed and served with the civil complaint or at any time thereafter.

(3) For purposes of this section, the term “conviction” means a finding of guilt, with or without adjudication of guilt, as a result of a jury verdict, nonjury trial, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.

The parent or legal guardian of an unemancipated minor is not liable under this section, under any circumstance, for the actions of the minor, if the court finds that the parent or legal guardian made a good faith effort to prevent the minor from engaging in the act giving rise to a cause of action under this section. (5) A defendant may recover reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs in the trial and appellate courts upon a finding that there is a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact raised by the complaint.
