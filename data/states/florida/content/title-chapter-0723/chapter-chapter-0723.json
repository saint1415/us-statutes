      "text": "723.002 Application of chapter.— (1) The provisions of this chapter apply to any residential tenancy in which a mobile home is placed upon a rented or leased lot in a mobile home park in which 10 or more lots are offered for rent or lease. This chapter shall not be construed to apply to any other tenancy, including a tenancy in which both a mobile home and a mobile home lot are rented or leased by the mobile home resident or a tenancy in which a rental space is offered for occupancy by recreational-vehicle-type units which are primarily designed as temporary living quarters for recreational camping or travel use and which either have their own motor power or are mounted on or drawn by another vehicle. When both the mobile home and lot are rented or when fewer than 10 lots are available for rent or lease, the tenancy shall be governed by the provisions of part II of chapter 83, the “Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.” However, this chapter shall continue to apply to any tenancy in a park even though the number of lots offered in that park has been reduced to below 10 if that tenancy was subject to the provisions of this chapter prior to the reduction in lots. This subsection is intended to clarify existing law. (2) The provisions of ss. 723.035, 723.037, 723.038, 723.054, 723.055, 723.056, 723.058, and 723.068 are applicable to mobile home subdivision developers and the owners of lots in mobile home subdivisions. (3) Any other provision of this chapter or any other provision of the Florida Statutes to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to a park trailer located on a mobile home lot in a mobile home park.

      "text": "723.004 Legislative intent; preemption of subject matter.— (1) The Legislature finds that there are factors unique to the relationship between a mobile home owner and a mobile home park owner. Once occupancy has commenced, unique factors can affect the bargaining position of the parties and can affect the operation of market forces. Because of those unique factors, there exist inherently real and substantial differences in the relationship which distinguish it from other landlord-tenant relationships. The Legislature recognizes that mobile home owners have basic property and other rights which must be protected. The Legislature further recognizes that the mobile home park owner has a legitimate business interest in the operation of the mobile home park as part of the housing market and has basic property and other rights which must be protected. This chapter is created for the purpose of regulating the factors unique to the relationship between mobile home owners and mobile home park owners in the circumstances described herein. It recognizes that when such inequalities exist between mobile home owners and mobile home park owners as a result of such unique factors, regulation to protect those parties to the extent that they are affected by the inequalities, while preserving and protecting the rights of both parties, is required. (2) There is hereby expressly preempted to the state all regulation and control of mobile home lot rents in mobile home parks and all those other matters and things relating to the landlord-tenant relationship treated by or falling within the purview of this chapter. Every unit of local government is prohibited from taking any action, including the enacting of any law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, with respect to the matters and things hereby preempted to the state. (3) It is expressly declared by the Legislature that the relationship between landlord and tenant as treated by or falling within the purview of this chapter is a matter reserved to the state and that units of local government are lacking in jurisdiction and authority in regard thereto. All local statutes and ordinances in conflict herewith are expressly repealed. (4) If any provision of this chapter is held invalid, it is the legislative intent that the preemption by this section shall no longer be applicable to the provision of the chapter held invalid. (5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the enforcement of a right or duty under this section, s. 723.022, s. 723.023, s. 723.031, s. 723.032, s. 723.033, s. 723.035, s. 723.037, s. 723.038, s. 723.061, s. 723.0615, s. 723.062, s. 723.063, or s. 723.081 by civil action after the party has exhausted its administrative remedies, if any.

      "text": "723.006 Powers and duties of division.—In performing its duties, the division has the following powers and duties: (1) The division may make necessary public or private investigations within or outside this state to determine whether any person has violated this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, to aid in the enforcement of this chapter, or to aid in the adoption of rules or forms hereunder. (2) The division may require or permit any person to file a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the division determines, as to the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated. (3) For the purpose of any investigation under this chapter, the division director or any officer or employee designated by the division director may administer oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any book, document, or other tangible thing and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of material evidence. Upon a person’s failure to obey a subpoena or to answer questions propounded by the investigating officer and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the division may apply to the circuit court for an order compelling compliance. Financial records of a mobile home park acquired by the division pursuant to any investigation under this section are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. However, if the division, pursuant to a consent order, final order, or cease and desist order, makes a finding that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the financial records acquired by the division specifically relevant to that finding are no longer exempt as provided for in this subsection, unless otherwise made specifically exempt by law. “Financial records” means any financial information which is owned or controlled by the mobile home park owner and is not otherwise required to be filed with the division under other sections of this chapter. (4) The division is authorized to prepare information to assist prospective mobile home owners and mobile home park owners in assessing the rights, privileges, and duties pertaining hereto. (5) Notwithstanding any remedies available to mobile home owners, mobile home park owners, and homeowners’ associations, if the division has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of any provision of this chapter or related rule has occurred, the division may institute enforcement proceedings in its own name against a developer, mobile home park owner, or homeowners’ association, or its assignee or agent, as follows: (a) The division may permit a person whose conduct or actions may be under investigation to waive formal proceedings and enter into a consent proceeding whereby orders, rules, or letters of censure or warning, whether formal or informal, may be entered against the person. (b) The division may issue an order requiring the mobile home park owner, or its assignee or agent, to cease and desist from an unlawful practice and take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the division will carry out the purposes of this chapter. The affirmative action may include the following: 1. Refunds of rent increases, improper fees, charges and assessments, including pass-throughs and pass-ons collected in violation of the terms of this chapter. 2. Filing and utilization of documents which correct a statutory or rule violation. 3. Reasonable action necessary to correct a statutory or rule violation. (c) In determining the amount of civil penalty or affirmative action to be imposed under this section, if any, the division must consider the following factors: 1. The gravity of the violation. 2. Whether the person has substantially complied with the provisions of this chapter. 3. Any action taken by the person to correct or mitigate the violation of this chapter. (d) The division may bring an action in circuit court on behalf of a class of mobile home owners, mobile home park owners, lessees, or purchasers for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, or restitution. (e)1. The division may impose a civil penalty against a mobile home park owner or homeowners’ association, or its assignee or agent, for any violation of this chapter, a properly adopted park rule or regulation, or a rule adopted pursuant hereto. A penalty may be imposed on the basis of each separate violation and, if the violation is a continuing one, for each day of continuing violation, but in no event may the penalty for each separate violation or for each day of continuing violation exceed $5,000. All amounts collected shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund. 2. If a violator fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon issue an order directing that such violator cease and desist from further violation until such time as the civil penalty is paid or may pursue enforcement of the penalty in a court of competent jurisdiction. If a homeowners’ association fails to pay the civil penalty, the division shall thereupon pursue enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order imposing the civil penalty or the cease and desist order shall not become effective until 20 days after the date of such order. Any action commenced by the division shall be brought in the county in which the division has its executive offices or in which the violation occurred. (6) With regard to any written complaint alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant thereto, the division shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written complaint, notify, in writing, the person who filed the complaint of the status of the complaint. Thereafter, the division shall notify the complainant of the status of the investigation within 90 days after receipt of the written complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the division shall notify, in writing, the complainant and the party complained against of the results of the investigation and disposition of the complaint. (7) The division has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. (8) The division has the authority by rule to authorize amendments permitted by this chapter to an approved prospectus or offering circular. (9) The division shall adopt rules establishing a category of minor violations of this chapter or rules promulgated pursuant hereto. A minor violation means a violation which does not endanger the health, safety, or welfare of mobile home residents, which does not involve the failure to make full and fair disclosure, or which does not cause economic harm to mobile home park residents. (10) The division is authorized to require disclosures to fully and fairly disclose all matters required by this chapter. If a park owner or operator, in good faith, has attempted to comply with the requirements of this chapter, and if, in fact, the park owner or operator has substantially complied with the disclosure requirements of this chapter, nonmaterial errors or omissions in the disclosure materials shall not be actionable. (11) Upon adoption of rules establishing minor violations and a determination by the division that the violation is a minor violation, the division may levy a civil penalty of up to $250 but shall not require a refund of rent increases, fees, charges or assessments, including pass-through and pass-ons collected from mobile home owners. Until rules have been adopted as provided in this section, the enforcement procedures of the division in existence on the effective date of this act shall be in effect. (12) The division shall approve training and educational programs for board members of mobile home owners’ associations formed and operated pursuant to s. 723.075(1) and mobile home owners. The training may, at the division’s discretion, include web-based electronic media and live training and seminars in various locations throughout the state. (13) The division may review and approve educational curricula and training programs for board members and mobile home owners to be offered by providers and shall maintain a current list of approved programs and providers, and make such lists available to board members in a reasonable and cost-effective manner. The cost of such programs shall be borne by the providers of the programs. The division shall establish a fee structure for the approved training programs sufficient to recover any cost incurred by the division in operating this program. (14) Required education curriculum information for board member and mobile home owner training shall include: (a) The provider of the training programs, which shall include the following information regarding its training and educational programs: 1. A price list, if any, for the programs and copies of all materials. 2. The physical location where programs will be available, if not web-based. 3. Dates when programs will be offered. 4. The curriculum of the program to be offered. (b) The programs shall provide information about statutory and regulatory matters relating to the board of directors of the homeowners’ association and their responsibilities to the association and to the mobile home owners in the mobile home park. (c) Programs and materials may not contain editorial comments. (d) The division has the right to approve and require changes to such education and training programs. (15) The division shall adopt rules to implement the board member training requirements for educational programs as provided in this chapter. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation shall publish a notice of proposed rule pursuant to s. 120.54(3)(a) by October 1, 2016. Such rules shall include the requirements for content and notice of the board member training program to assure that providers meet minimum training requirements.

If the number of mobile home lots in the park increases by more than 15 percent of the total number of lots in the original prospectus, the mobile home park owner must reasonably offset the impact of the additional lots by increasing the shared facilities. The amendment to the prospectus must include a reasonable timeframe for providing the required additional shared facilities. The costs and expenses necessary to increase the shared facilities may not be passed on or passed through to the existing mobile home owners. (6) The arrangements for management of the park and maintenance and operation of the park property and of other property that will serve the mobile home owners and the nature of the services included.

(8) The manner in which utility and other services, including, but not limited to, sewage and waste disposal, cable television, water supply, and storm drainage, will be provided, and the person or entity furnishing them. The services and the lot rental amount or user fees charged by the park owner for the services provided by the park owner shall also be disclosed. (9) An explanation of the manner in which the lot rental amount will be raised, including, but not limited to: (a) Notification of the mobile home owner at least 90 days in advance of the increase. (b) Disclosure of any factors which may affect the lot rental amount, including, but not limited to: 1. Water rates. 2. Sewer rates. 3. Waste disposal rates. 4. Maintenance costs, including costs of deferred maintenance. 5. Management costs. 6. Property taxes. 7. Major repairs or improvements. 8. Any other fees, costs, entrance fees, or charges to which the mobile home owner may be subjected. (c) Disclosure of the manner in which the pass-through charges will be assessed. (10) Disclosure of all user fees currently charged for services offered which the homeowner may elect to incur and the manner in which the fees will be increased.

      "text": "723.031 Mobile home lot rental agreements.— (1) No rental agreement shall contain any rule or regulation prohibited by this chapter, nor shall it provide for promulgation of any rule or regulation inconsistent with this chapter or amendment of any rule or regulation inconsistently with this chapter. (2) Whether or not a tenancy is covered by a valid written rental agreement, the required statutory provisions shall be deemed to be a part of the rental agreement. (3) The homeowner shall have no financial obligation to the park owner as a condition of occupancy in the park, except the lot rental amount. The parties may agree otherwise as to user fees which the homeowner chooses to incur. No user fees shall be charged by the park owner to the mobile home owner for any services which were previously provided by the park owner and included in the lot rental amount unless there is a corresponding decrease in the lot rental amount. (4) No rental agreement shall be offered by a park owner for a term of less than 1 year, and if there is no written rental agreement, no rental term shall be less than 1 year from the date of initial occupancy; however, the initial term may be less than 1 year in order to permit the park owner to have all rental agreements within the park commence at the same time. Thereafter, all terms shall be for a minimum of 1 year. (5) The rental agreement must contain the lot rental amount and services included. An increase in lot rental amount upon expiration of the term of the lot rental agreement must be in accordance with ss. 723.033 and 723.037 or s. 723.059(4), whichever is applicable; provided that, pursuant to s. 723.059(4), the amount of the lot rental increase is disclosed and agreed to by the purchaser, in writing. An increase in lot rental amount shall not be arbitrary or discriminatory between similarly situated tenants in the park. A lot rental amount may not be increased during the term of the lot rental agreement, except: (a) When the manner of the increase is disclosed in a lot rental agreement with a term exceeding 12 months and which provides for such increases not more frequently than annually. (b) For pass-through charges as defined in s. 723.003. (c) That a charge may not be collected which results in payment of money for sums previously collected as part of the lot rental amount. The provisions hereof notwithstanding, the mobile home park owner may pass on, at any time during the term of the lot rental agreement, ad valorem property taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges, or increases of either, provided that the ad valorem property taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges are not otherwise being collected in the remainder of the lot rental amount and provided further that the passing on of such ad valorem taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, or utility charges, or increases of either, was disclosed prior to tenancy, was being passed on as a matter of custom between the mobile home park owner and the mobile home owner, or such passing on was authorized by law. A park owner is deemed to have disclosed the passing on of ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem assessments if ad valorem property taxes or non-ad valorem assessments were disclosed as a separate charge or a factor for increasing the lot rental amount in the prospectus or rental agreement. Such ad valorem taxes, non-ad valorem assessments, and utility charges shall be a part of the lot rental amount as defined by this chapter. The term “non-ad valorem assessments” has the same meaning as provided in s. 197.3632(1)(d). Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, pass-on charges may be passed on only within 1 year of the date a mobile home park owner remits payment of the charge. A mobile home park owner is prohibited from passing on any fine, interest, fee, or increase in a charge resulting from a park owner’s payment of the charge after the date such charges become delinquent. A mobile home park owner is prohibited from charging or collecting from the mobile home owners any sum for ad valorem taxes or non-ad valorem tax charges in an amount in excess of the sums remitted by the park owner to the tax collector. Nothing herein shall prohibit a park owner and a homeowner from mutually agreeing to an alternative manner of payment to the park owner of the charges. (d) If a notice of increase in lot rental amount is not given 90 days before the renewal date of the rental agreement, the rental agreement must remain under the same terms until a 90-day notice of increase in lot rental amount is given. The notice may provide for a rental term shorter than 1 year in order to maintain the same renewal date. (6) Except for pass-through charges, as defined in this chapter, failure on the part of the mobile home park owner or developer to disclose fully all fees, charges, or assessments prior to tenancy, unless it can be shown that such fees, charges, or assessments have been collected as a matter of custom between the mobile home park owner and the mobile home owner, shall prevent the park owner or operator from collecting said fees, charges, or assessments; and refusal by the mobile home owner to pay any such fee, charge, or assessment shall not be used by the park owner or developer as a cause for eviction in any court of law. (7) No park owner may increase the lot rental amount until an approved prospectus has been delivered if one is required. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit those increases in lot rental amount for those lot rental agreements for which an approved prospectus was required to be delivered and which was delivered on or before July 1, 1986, if the mobile home park owner had: (a) Filed a prospectus with the division prior to entering into the lot rental agreement; (b) Made a good faith effort to correct deficiencies cited by the division by responding within the time limit set by the division, if one was set; and (c) Delivered the approved prospectus to the mobile home owner within 45 days of approval by the division. This subsection shall not preclude the finding that a lot rental increase is invalid on other grounds and shall not be construed to limit any rights of a mobile home owner or to preclude a mobile home owner from seeking any remedies allowed by this chapter, including a determination that the lot rental agreement or any part thereof is unreasonable. (8) If a mobile home owner has deposited or advanced money on a rental agreement as security for performance of the rental agreement, which money is held in excess of 3 months by the mobile home park owner or his or her agent, such deposit shall be handled pursuant to s. 83.49. (9) No rental agreement shall provide for the eviction of a mobile home owner on a ground other than one contained in s. 723.061.

(b) Refuse to enforce the rent increase or change. (c) Enforce the remainder of the lot rental agreement without the unreasonable provision. (d) Limit the application of the unreasonable provision so as to avoid any unreasonable result. (e) Award a refund or a reduction in future rent payments. (f) Award such other equitable relief as deemed necessary. (2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that a lot rental amount, rent increase, or change, or any provision thereof, may be unreasonable, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its meaning and purpose, the relationship of the parties, and other relevant factors to aid the court in making the determination. (3) For the purposes of this section, a lot rental amount that is in excess of market rent shall be considered unreasonable. (4) Market rent means that rent which would result from market forces absent an unequal bargaining position between mobile home park owners and mobile home owners. (5) In determining market rent, the court may consider rents charged by comparable mobile home parks in its competitive area. To be comparable, a mobile home park must offer similar facilities, services, amenities, and management. (6) In determining whether a rent increase or resulting lot rental amount is unreasonable, the court may consider economic or other factors, including, but not limited to, increases or decreases in the consumer price index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor; increases or decreases in operating costs or taxes; and prior disclosures. (7) An arbitrator or mediator under ss. 723.037, 723.038, and 723.0381 shall employ the same standards as set forth in this section. History.—s. 1, ch. 84-80; s. 9, ch. 90-198.

(2) The division, upon receipt of a petition, shall appoint a qualified mediator to conduct mediation proceedings and notify the parties within 20 days after such appointment, unless the parties timely notify the division in writing that they have selected a mediator. A person appointed by the division or selected by the parties must be a qualified mediator from a list of circuit court mediators in each judicial circuit who has met training and educational requirements established by the Supreme Court. If such mediators are not available, the division or the parties may select a mediator from the list maintained by the Florida Growth Management Conflict Resolution Consortium. The division shall adopt rules of procedure to govern such proceedings in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure adopted by the Supreme Court. The division shall also establish, by rule, the fee to be charged by a mediator which shall not exceed the fee authorized by the circuit court. (3) A mediator appointed by the division or selected by the parties shall comply with the rules adopted by the division. The mediator shall also notify the division in writing within 10 days after the conclusion of the mediation, that the mediation has been concluded. (4) After the date of the last scheduled meeting held pursuant to s. 723.037(4), the parties to a dispute may agree to immediately select a mediator and initiate mediation proceedings pursuant to this section. The parties may accept the mediator appointed by the division or, within 30 days, select a mediator to mediate the dispute pursuant to subsection (2). The parties shall each pay a $250 filing fee to the mediator appointed by the division or selected by the parties within 30 days after the division notifies the parties of the appointment of the mediator. The $250 filing fee shall be used by the mediator to defray the hourly rate charged for mediation of the dispute. Any portion of the filing fee not used shall be refunded to the parties. (5) The parties may agree to select their own mediator, and such mediation shall be governed by the rules of procedure established by the division. The parties, by agreement, may waive mediation, or the petitioning party may withdraw the petition prior to mediation. Upon the conclusion of the mediation, the mediator shall notify the division that the mediation has been concluded. (6) No resolution arising from a mediation proceeding as provided for in s. 723.037 or this section shall be deemed final agency action. Any party, however, may initiate an action in the circuit court to enforce a resolution or agreement arising from a mediation proceeding which has been reduced to writing. The court shall consider such resolution or agreement to be a contract for the purpose of providing a remedy to the complaining party. (7) Mediation pursuant to this section is an informal and nonadversarial process. Either party may submit to the opposing party at least 10 days prior to mediation a written request for information. (8) Each party involved in the mediation proceeding has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any person present at the proceeding from disclosing, communications made during such proceeding, whether or not the dispute was successfully resolved. This subsection shall not be construed to prevent or inhibit the discovery or admissibility of any information which is otherwise subject to discovery or admission under applicable law or rules of court. There is no privilege as to communications made in furtherance of the commission of a crime or fraud or as part of a plan to commit a crime or a fraud. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed so as to permit an individual to obtain immunity from prosecution for criminal conduct. (9) A mediator appointed by the division or selected by the parties pursuant to this section has judicial immunity in the same manner and to the same extent as a judge.

The court shall order the hearing to be held informally with presentation of testimony kept to a minimum and matters presented to the arbitrators primarily through the statements and arguments of counsel. The court shall assess the parties equally to pay the compensation awarded to the arbitrators if neither party requests a trial de novo. If a party has filed for a trial de novo, the party shall be assessed the arbitration costs, court costs, and other reasonable costs of the opposing party, including attorney’s fees, investigation expenses, and expenses for expert or other testimony or evidence incurred after the arbitration hearing if the judgment upon the trial de novo is not more favorable than the arbitration decision.

The purchaser of the mobile home may cancel or rescind the contract for purchase of the mobile home if the purchaser’s tenancy has not been approved by the park owner 5 days before the closing of the purchase. (2) Properly promulgated rules may provide for the screening of any prospective purchaser to determine whether or not such purchaser is qualified to become a tenant of the park. (3) The purchaser of a mobile home who intends to become a resident of the mobile home park in accordance with this section has the right to assume the remainder of the term of any rental agreement then in effect between the mobile home park owner and the seller and may assume the seller’s prospectus. However, nothing herein shall prohibit a mobile home park owner from offering the purchaser of a mobile home any approved prospectus. (4) However, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a mobile home park owner from increasing the rental amount to be paid by the purchaser upon the expiration of the assumed rental agreement in an amount deemed appropriate by the mobile home park owner, so long as such increase is disclosed to the purchaser prior to his or her occupancy and is imposed in a manner consistent with the purchaser’s prospectus and this act. (5) Lifetime leases and the renewal provisions in automatically renewable leases, both those existing and those entered into after July 1, 1986, are not assumable unless otherwise provided in the mobile home lot rental agreement or unless the transferee is the home owner’s spouse. The right to an assumption of the lease by a spouse may be exercised only one time during the term of that lease.

In order for the home owner to raise the defense of retaliatory conduct, the home owner must have acted in good faith and not for any improper purposes, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or for frivolous purpose or needless increase in the cost of litigation. Examples of conduct for which the park owner may not retaliate include, but are not limited to, situations where: (a) The home owner has in good faith complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building, housing, or health code of a suspected violation applicable to the mobile home park; (b) The home owner has organized, encouraged, or participated in a homeowners’ organization; or (c) The home owner has complained to the park owner for failure to comply with s. 723.022. (2) Evidence of retaliatory conduct may be raised by the home owner as a defense in any action brought against him or her for possession. (3) In any event, this section does not apply if the park owner proves that the eviction is for good cause. Examples of such good cause include, but are not limited to, good faith actions for nonpayment of the lot rental amount, violation of the rental agreement or of park rules, or violation of the terms of this chapter.

The defense of material noncompliance may be raised by the mobile home owner only if 7 days have elapsed after he or she has notified the park owner in writing of his or her intention not to pay rent, or a portion thereof, based upon the park owner’s noncompliance with portions of this chapter, specifying in reasonable detail the provisions in default. A material noncompliance with this chapter by the park owner is a complete defense to an action for possession based upon nonpayment of rent, or a portion thereof, and, upon hearing, the court or the jury, as the case may be, shall determine the amount, if any, by which the rent is to be reduced to reflect the diminution in value of the lot during the period of noncompliance with any portion of this chapter. After consideration of all other relevant issues, the court shall enter appropriate judgment. (2) In any action by the park owner or a mobile home owner brought under subsection (1), the mobile home owner shall pay into the registry of the court that portion of the accrued rent, if any, relating to the claim of material noncompliance as alleged in the complaint, or as determined by the court. The court shall notify the mobile home owner of such requirement. The failure of the mobile home owner to pay the rent, or portion thereof, into the registry of the court as required herein constitutes an absolute waiver of the mobile home owner’s defenses other than payment, and the park owner is entitled to an immediate default. (3) When the mobile home owner has deposited funds into the registry of the court in accordance with the provisions of this section and the park owner is in actual danger of loss of the premises or other personal hardship resulting from the loss of rental income from the premises, the park owner may apply to the court for disbursement of all or part of the funds or for prompt final hearing, whereupon the court shall advance the cause on the calendar. The court, after preliminary hearing, may award all or any portion of the funds on deposit to the park owner or may proceed immediately to a final resolution of the cause.

      "text": "723.078 Bylaws of homeowners’ associations.— (1) The directors of the association and the operation shall be governed by the bylaws. (2) The bylaws shall provide and, if they do not, shall be deemed to include, the following provisions: (a) Administration.—The form of administration of the association shall be described, providing for the titles of the officers and for a board of directors and specifying the powers, duties, manner of selection and removal, and compensation, if any, of officers and board members. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, the board of directors shall be composed of five members. The board of directors shall elect a president, secretary, and treasurer who shall perform the duties of those offices customarily performed by officers of corporations, and these officers shall serve without compensation and at the pleasure of the board of directors. The board of directors may elect and designate other officers and grant them those duties it deems appropriate. (b) Quorum; voting requirements; proxies.— 1. Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, 30 percent of the total membership is required to constitute a quorum. Decisions shall be made by a majority of members represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 2.a. A member may not vote by general proxy but may vote by limited proxies substantially conforming to a limited proxy form adopted by the division. Limited proxies and general proxies may be used to establish a quorum. Limited proxies may be used for votes taken to amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to this section, and any other matters for which this chapter requires or permits a vote of members. A proxy, limited or general, may not be used in the election of board members in general elections or elections to fill vacancies caused by recall, resignation, or otherwise. Board members must be elected by written ballot or by voting in person. If a mobile home or subdivision lot is owned jointly, the owners of the mobile home or subdivision lot must be counted as one for the purpose of determining the number of votes required for a majority. Only one vote per mobile home or subdivision lot shall be counted. Any number greater than 50 percent of the total number of votes constitutes a majority. Notwithstanding this section, members may vote in person at member meetings or by secret ballot, including absentee ballots, as defined by the division. b. Elections shall be decided by a plurality of the ballots cast. There is no quorum requirement; however, at least 20 percent of the eligible voters must cast a ballot in order to have a valid election. A member may not allow any other person to cast his or her ballot, and any ballots improperly cast are invalid. An election is not required unless there are more candidates nominated than vacancies that exist on the board. c. Each member or other eligible person who desires to be a candidate for the board of directors shall appear on the ballot in alphabetical order by surname. A ballot may not indicate if any of the candidates are incumbent on the board. All ballots must be uniform in appearance. Write-in candidates and more than one vote per candidate per ballot are not allowed. A ballot may not provide a space for the signature of, or any other means of identifying, a voter. If a ballot contains more votes than vacancies or fewer votes than vacancies, the ballot is invalid unless otherwise stated in the bylaws. d. An impartial committee shall be responsible for overseeing the election process and complying with all ballot requirements. For purposes of this section, the term “impartial committee” means a committee whose members do not include any of the following people or their spouses: (I) Current board members. (II) Current association officers. (III) Candidates for the association or board. e. The association bylaws shall provide a method for determining the winner of an election in which two or more candidates for the same position receive the same number of votes. f. The division shall adopt procedural rules to govern elections, including, but not limited to, rules for providing notice by electronic transmission and rules for maintaining the secrecy of ballots. 3. A proxy is effective only for the specific meeting for which originally given and any lawfully adjourned meetings thereof. In no event shall any proxy be valid for a period longer than 90 days after the date of the first meeting for which it was given. Every proxy shall be revocable at any time at the pleasure of the member executing it. 4. A member of the board of directors or a committee may submit in writing his or her agreement or disagreement with any action taken at a meeting that the member did not attend. This agreement or disagreement may not be used as a vote for or against the action taken and may not be used for the purposes of creating a quorum. (c) Board of directors’ and committee meetings.— 1. Meetings of the board of directors and meetings of its committees at which a quorum is present shall be open to all members. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the requirement that board meetings and committee meetings be open to the members does not apply to meetings between the park owner and the board of directors or any of the board’s committees, board or committee meetings held for the purpose of discussing personnel matters, or meetings between the board or a committee and the association’s attorney, with respect to potential or pending litigation, when the meeting is held for the purpose of seeking or rendering legal advice, and when the contents of the discussion would otherwise be governed by the attorney-client privilege. Notice of all meetings open to members shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the park property at least 48 hours in advance, except in an emergency. Notice of any meeting in which dues are to be considered for any reason shall specifically contain a statement that dues will be considered and the nature of such dues. 2. A board or committee member’s participation in a meeting via telephone, real-time videoconferencing, or similar real-time telephonic, electronic, or video communication counts toward a quorum, and such member may vote as if physically present. A speaker shall be used so that the conversation of those board or committee members attending by telephone may be heard by the board or committee members attending in person, as well as by members present at a meeting. 3. Members of the board of directors may use e-mail as a means of communication but may not cast a vote on an association matter via e-mail. 4. The right to attend meetings of the board of directors and its committees includes the right to speak at such meetings with reference to all designated agenda items. The association may adopt reasonable written rules governing the frequency, duration, and manner of members’ statements. Any item not included on the notice may be taken up on an emergency basis by at least a majority plus one of the members of the board. Such emergency action shall be noticed and ratified at the next regular meeting of the board. Any member may tape record or videotape meetings of the board of directors and its committees, except meetings between the board of directors or its appointed homeowners’ committee and the park owner. The division shall adopt reasonable rules governing the tape recording and videotaping of the meeting. 5. Except as provided in paragraph (i), a vacancy occurring on the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, even though the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum; by the sole remaining director; if the vacancy is not so filled or if no director remains, by the members; or, on the application of any person, by the circuit court of the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located. 6. The term of a director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy expires at the next annual meeting at which directors are elected. A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors, but only for the term of office continuing until the next election of directors by the members. 7. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, by reason of a resignation effective at a later date, may be filled before the vacancy occurs. However, the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. 8.a. The officers and directors of the association have a fiduciary relationship to the members. b. A director and committee member shall discharge his or her duties in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. 9. In discharging his or her duties, a director may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: a. One or more officers or employees of the corporation who the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; b. Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the persons’ professional or expert competence; or c. A committee of the board of directors of which he or she is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence. 10. A director is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subparagraph 9. unwarranted. 11. A director is not liable for any action taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, if he or she performed the duties of his or her office in compliance with this section. (d) Member meetings.—Members shall meet at least once each calendar year, and the meeting shall be the annual meeting. All members of the board of directors shall be elected at the annual meeting unless the bylaws provide for staggered election terms or for their election at another meeting. The bylaws shall not restrict any member desiring to be a candidate for board membership from being nominated from the floor. All nominations from the floor must be made at a duly noticed meeting of the members held at least 27 days before the annual meeting. The bylaws shall provide the method for calling the meetings of the members, including annual meetings. The method shall provide at least 14 days’ written notice to each member in advance of the meeting and require the posting in a conspicuous place on the park property of a notice of the meeting at least 14 days prior to the meeting. The right to receive written notice of membership meetings may be waived in writing by a member. Unless waived, the notice of the annual meeting shall be mailed, hand delivered, or electronically transmitted to each member, and shall constitute notice. Unless otherwise stated in the bylaws, an officer of the association shall provide an affidavit affirming that the notices were mailed, hand delivered, or provided by electronic transmission in accordance with this section to each member at the address last furnished to the corporation. These meeting requirements do not prevent members from waiving notice of meetings or from acting by written agreement without meetings, if allowed by the bylaws. (e) Minutes of meetings.— 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the minutes of board or committee meetings that are closed to members are privileged and confidential and are not available for inspection or photocopying. 2. Minutes of all meetings of members of an association and meetings open to members of the board of directors and a committee of the board must be maintained in written form and approved by the members, board, or committee, as applicable. A vote or abstention from voting on each matter voted upon for each director present at a board meeting must be recorded in the minutes. 3. All approved minutes of open meetings of members, committees, and the board of directors shall be kept in a businesslike manner and shall be available for inspection by members, or their authorized representatives, and board members at reasonable times. The association shall retain these minutes within this state for at least 5 years. (f) Manner of sharing assessments.—The share or percentage of, and manner of sharing, assessments and expenses for each member shall be stated. (g) Annual budget.—If the bylaws provide for adoption of an annual budget by the members, the board of directors shall mail a meeting notice and copies of the proposed annual budget of expenses to the members at least 30 days before the meeting at which the budget will be considered. If the bylaws provide that the budget may be adopted by the board of directors, the members shall be given written notice of the time and place at which the meeting of the board of directors to consider the budget will be held. The meeting shall be open to the members. If the bylaws do not provide for adoption of an annual budget, this paragraph shall not apply. (h) Amendment of articles of incorporation and bylaws.— 1. The method by which the articles of incorporation and bylaws may be amended consistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be stated. If the bylaws fail to provide a method of amendment, the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors and approved by a majority of members at a meeting at which a quorum is present. No bylaw shall be revised or amended by reference to its title or number only. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an amendment to the articles of incorporation or the bylaws is required by any action of any federal, state, or local governmental authority or agency, or any law, ordinance, or rule thereof, the board of directors may, by a majority vote of the board, at a duly noticed meeting of the board, amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws without a vote of the membership. (i) Recall of board members.—Any member of the board of directors may be recalled and removed from office with or without cause by the vote of or agreement in writing by a majority of all members. A special meeting of the members to recall a member or members of the board of directors may be called by 10 percent of the members giving notice of the meeting as required for a meeting of members, and the notice shall state the purpose of the meeting. Electronic transmission may not be used as a method of giving notice of a meeting called in whole or in part for this purpose. 1. If the recall is approved by a majority of all members by a vote at a meeting, the recall is effective as provided in this paragraph. The board shall duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the member meeting to recall one or more board members. At the meeting, the board shall either certify the recall, in which case such member or members shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board within 5 full business days any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or shall proceed under subparagraph 3. 2. If the proposed recall is by an agreement in writing by a majority of all members, the agreement in writing or a copy thereof shall be served on the association by certified mail or by personal service in the manner authorized by chapter 48 and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The board of directors shall duly notice and hold a meeting of the board within 5 full business days after receipt of the agreement in writing. At the meeting, the board shall either certify the written agreement to recall members of the board, in which case such members shall be recalled effective immediately and shall turn over to the board, within 5 full business days, any and all records and property of the association in their possession, or shall proceed as described in subparagraph 3. 3. If the board determines not to certify the written agreement to recall members of the board, or does not certify the recall by a vote at a meeting, the board shall, within 5 full business days after the board meeting, file with the division a petition for binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures of s. 723.1255. For purposes of this paragraph, the members who voted at the meeting or who executed the agreement in writing shall constitute one party under the petition for arbitration. If the arbitrator certifies the recall of a member of the board, the recall shall be effective upon mailing of the final order of arbitration to the association. If the association fails to comply with the order of the arbitrator, the division may take action under s. 723.006. A member so recalled shall deliver to the board any and all records and property of the association in the member’s possession within 5 full business days after the effective date of the recall. 4. If the board fails to duly notice and hold a board meeting within 5 full business days after service of an agreement in writing or within 5 full business days after the adjournment of the members’ recall meeting, the recall shall be deemed effective and the board members so recalled shall immediately turn over to the board all records and property of the association. 5. If the board fails to duly notice and hold the required meeting or fails to file the required petition, the member’s representative may file a petition pursuant to s. 723.1255 challenging the board’s failure to act. The petition must be filed within 60 days after expiration of the applicable 5-full-business-day period. The review of a petition under this subparagraph is limited to the sufficiency of service on the board and the facial validity of the written agreement or ballots filed. 6. If a vacancy occurs on the board as a result of a recall and less than a majority of the board members are removed, the vacancy may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter. If vacancies occur on the board as a result of a recall and a majority or more of the board members are removed, the vacancies shall be filled in accordance with procedural rules to be adopted by the division, which rules need not be consistent with this chapter. The rules must provide procedures governing the conduct of the recall election as well as the operation of the association during the period after a recall but before the recall election. 7. A board member who has been recalled may file a petition pursuant to s. 723.1255 challenging the validity of the recall. The petition must be filed within 60 days after the recall is deemed certified. The association and the member’s representative shall be named as the respondents. 8. The division may not accept for filing a recall petition, whether or not filed pursuant to this subsection, and regardless of whether the recall was certified, when there are 60 or fewer days until the scheduled reelection of the board member sought to be recalled or when 60 or fewer days have not elapsed since the election of the board member sought to be recalled. (3) The bylaws may provide the following: (a) A method of adopting and of amending administrative rules and regulations governing the details of the operation and use of the park property. (b) Restrictions on, and requirements respecting, the use and maintenance of mobile homes located within the park, and the use of the park property, which restrictions and requirements are not inconsistent with the articles of incorporation. (c) Other provisions not inconsistent with this chapter or with other documents governing the park property or mobile homes located therein. (d) The board of directors may, in any event, propose a budget to the members at a meeting of members or in writing, and, if the budget or proposed budget is approved by the members at the meeting or by a majority of their whole number in writing, that budget shall be adopted. (e) The manner of collecting from the members their shares of the expenses for maintenance of the park property shall be stated. Assessments shall be made against members not less frequently than quarterly, in amounts no less than are required to provide funds in advance for payments of all of the anticipated current operating expenses and for all of the unpaid operating expense previously incurred. (4) No amendment may change the proportion or percentage by which members share in the assessments and expenses as initially established unless all the members affected by such change approve the amendment.

The board may temporarily fill the vacancy during the period of suspension. (4) The secretary of the association shall retain a director’s written certification or educational certificate for inspection by the members for 5 years after the director’s election or the duration of the director’s uninterrupted tenure, whichever is longer.

      "text": "723.079 Powers and duties of homeowners’ association.— (1) An association may contract, sue, or be sued with respect to the exercise or nonexercise of its powers. For these purposes, the powers of the association include, but are not limited to, the maintenance, management, and operation of the park property. (2) The powers and duties of an association include those set forth in this section and ss. 723.075 and 723.077 and those set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws and any recorded declarations or restrictions encumbering the park property, if not inconsistent with this chapter. (3) An association has the power to make, levy, and collect assessments and to lease, maintain, repair, and replace the common areas upon purchase of the mobile home park. (4) The association shall maintain the following items, when applicable, which constitute the official records of the association: (a) A copy of the association’s articles of incorporation and each amendment to the articles of incorporation. (b) A copy of the bylaws of the association and each amendment to the bylaws. (c) A copy of the written rules or policies of the association and each amendment to the written rules or policies. (d) The approved minutes of all meetings of the members of an association and meetings open for members of the board of directors, and committees of the board, which minutes must be retained within this state for at least 5 years. (e) A current roster of all members and their mailing addresses and lot identifications. The association shall also maintain the e-mail addresses and the numbers designated by members for receiving notice sent by electronic transmission of those members consenting to receive notice by electronic transmission. The e-mail addresses and numbers provided by members to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be removed from association records when consent to receive notice by electronic transmission is revoked. However, the association is not liable for an erroneous disclosure of the e-mail address or the number for receiving electronic transmission of notices. (f) All of the association’s insurance policies or copies thereof, which must be retained within this state for at least 5 years after the expiration date of the policy. (g) A copy of all contracts or agreements to which the association is a party, including, without limitation, any written agreements with the park owner, lease, or other agreements or contracts under which the association or its members has any obligation or responsibility, which must be retained within this state for at least 5 years after the expiration date of the contract or agreement. (h) The financial and accounting records of the association, kept according to good accounting practices. All financial and accounting records must be maintained within this state for at least 5 years. The financial and accounting records must include: 1. Accurate, itemized, and detailed records of all receipts and expenditures. 2. A current account and a periodic statement of the account for each member, designating the name and current address of each member who is obligated to pay dues or assessments, the due date and amount of each assessment or other charge against the member, the date and amount of each payment on the account, and the balance due. 3. All tax returns, financial statements, and financial reports of the association. 4. Any other records that identify, measure, record, or communicate financial information. (i) All other written records of the association not specifically included in the foregoing which are related to the operation of the association must be retained within this state for at least 5 years or at least 5 years after the expiration date, as applicable. (5) The official records shall be made available to a member for inspection or photocopying within 20 business days after receipt by the board or its designee of a written request submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested. The requirements of this subsection are satisfied by having a copy of the official records available for inspection or copying in the park or, at the option of the association, by making the records available to a member electronically via the Internet or by allowing the records to be viewed in electronic format on a computer screen and printed upon request. If the association has a photocopy machine available where the records are maintained, it must provide a member with copies on request during the inspection if the entire request is no more than 25 pages. An association shall allow a member or his or her authorized representative to use a portable device, including a smartphone, tablet, portable scanner, or any other technology capable of scanning or taking photographs, to make an electronic copy of the official records in lieu of the association’s providing the member or his or her authorized representative with a copy of such records. The association may not charge a fee to a member or his or her authorized representative for the use of a portable device. (a) The failure of an association to provide access to the records within 20 business days after receipt of a written request submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, creates a rebuttable presumption that the association willfully failed to comply with this subsection. (b) A member who is denied access to official records is entitled to damages for the association’s willful failure to comply with this subsection in the amount of $10 per calendar day up to 10 days, not to exceed $100. The calculation for damages begins on the 21st business day after receipt of the written request, submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested. (c) A dispute between a member and an association regarding inspecting or photocopying official records must be submitted to mandatory binding arbitration with the division, and the arbitration must be conducted pursuant to s. 723.1255 and procedural rules adopted by the division. (d) The association may adopt reasonable written rules governing the frequency, time, location, notice, records to be inspected, and manner of inspections, but may not require a member to demonstrate a proper purpose for the inspection, state a reason for the inspection, or limit a member’s right to inspect records to less than 1 business day per month. The association may impose fees to cover the costs of providing copies of the official records, including the costs of copying and for personnel to retrieve and copy the records if the time spent retrieving and copying the records exceeds 30 minutes and if the personnel costs do not exceed $20 per hour. Personnel costs may not be charged for records requests that result in the copying of 25 or fewer pages. The association may charge up to 25 cents per page for copies made on the association’s photocopier. If the association does not have a photocopy machine available where the records are kept, or if the records requested to be copied exceed 25 pages in length, the association may have copies made by an outside duplicating service and may charge the actual cost of copying, as supported by the vendor invoice. The association shall maintain an adequate number of copies of the recorded governing documents, to ensure their availability to members and prospective members. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the following records are not accessible to members or home owners: 1. A record protected by the lawyer-client privilege as described in s. 90.502 and a record protected by the work-product privilege, including, but not limited to, a record prepared by an association attorney or prepared at the attorney’s express direction which reflects a mental impression, conclusion, litigation strategy, or legal theory of the attorney or the association and which was prepared exclusively for civil or criminal litigation, for adversarial administrative proceedings, or in anticipation of such litigation or proceedings until the conclusion of the litigation or proceedings. 2. E-mail addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, emergency contact information, any addresses for a home owner other than as provided for association notice requirements, and other personal identifying information of any person, excluding the person’s name, lot designation, mailing address, and property address. Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subparagraph, an association may print and distribute to home owners a directory containing the name, park address, and telephone number of each home owner. However, a home owner may exclude his or her telephone number from the directory by so requesting in writing to the association. The association is not liable for the disclosure of information that is protected under this subparagraph if the information is included in an official record of the association and is voluntarily provided by a home owner and not requested by the association. 3. An electronic security measure that is used by the association to safeguard data, including passwords. 4. The software and operating system used by the association which allows the manipulation of data, even if the home owner owns a copy of the same software used by the association. The data is part of the official records of the association. (6) An outgoing board or committee member must relinquish all official records and property of the association in his or her possession or under his or her control to the incoming board within 5 days after the election or removal. (7) An association has the power to purchase lots in the park and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, and convey them. (8) An association shall use its best efforts to obtain and maintain adequate insurance to protect the association and the park property upon purchase of the mobile home park. A copy of each policy of insurance in effect shall be made available for inspection by owners at reasonable times. (9) An association has the authority, without the joinder of any home owner, to modify, move, or create any easement for ingress and egress or for the purpose of utilities if the easement constitutes part of or crosses the park property upon purchase of the mobile home park. This subsection does not authorize the association to modify or move any easement created in whole or in part for the use or benefit of anyone other than the members, or crossing the property of anyone other than the members, without his or her consent or approval as required by law or the instrument creating the easement. Nothing in this subsection affects the rights of ingress or egress of any member of the association. (10) Any mobile home owners’ association or group of residents of a mobile home park as defined in this chapter may conduct bingo games as provided in s. 849.0931. (11) An association organized under this chapter may offer subscriptions, for the purpose of raising the necessary funds to purchase, acquire, and operate the mobile home park, to its members or other owners of mobile homes within the park. Subscription funds collected for the purpose of purchasing the park shall be placed in an association or other escrow account prior to purchase, which funds shall be held according to the terms of the subscription agreement. The directors shall maintain accounting records according to generally accepted accounting practices and shall, upon written request by a subscriber, furnish an accounting of the subscription fund escrow account within 60 days of the purchase of the park or the ending date as provided in the subscription agreement, whichever occurs first. (12) For a period of 180 days after the date of a purchase of a mobile home park by the association, the association shall not be required to comply with the provisions of part V of chapter 718, part V of chapter 719, or part II of chapter 720, as to mobile home owners or persons who have executed contracts to purchase mobile homes in the park. (13) The provisions of subsections (4) and (7) shall not apply to records relating to subscription funds collected pursuant to subsection (11).

      "heading": "Storage charges on mobile homes.",
      "text": "723.084 Storage charges on mobile homes.— (1) As provided by this section, any lien or charge against a mobile home for storage upon the real property on which the mobile home is or has been located is subordinate to the rights of a lienholder for unpaid purchase price or first lien, which is recorded on the title of the mobile home, and the assignee of such lienholder if not recorded on the title. However, storage charges, as provided in this section, may be collected by the real property owner from the lienholder and the assignee of such lienholder by an action at law as authorized by this act. The term “lienholder” as used in this act applies only to the lienholder for unpaid purchase price or first lien who has recorded said lien on the title of the mobile home. (2) The real property owner shall be entitled to collect storage charges accruing from 5 days after the lienholder receives written notice of either an eviction proceeding instituted by the real property owner against the homeowner, or that the mobile home is abandoned or voluntarily surrendered by the homeowner. The notice shall state that an action for eviction has been filed against the homeowner, the amount of the daily storage charges calculated pursuant to this section, and the date upon which the homeowner is required to make regular payments to the property owner. (3) The lienholder must notify the property owner within 30 days of receipt of the notice pursuant to subsection (2) whether it intends to make payment of the storage charges and, if the lienholder agrees to make payment, to pay the storage charges accruing to that date. Thereafter, the lienholder shall pay storage charges according to the schedule of payments that the homeowner was responsible for paying. In the event that the lienholder does not notify the property owner of its intention to not pay storage charges, the storage charges shall accrue and be due and owing to the property owner. In the event the lienholder notifies the property owner within 30 days of the receipt of the notice that it does not intend to pay the storage charges, the storage charges shall not accrue, but the lienholder shall not be entitled to any of the protections set forth in this act, and shall be subject to any remedies available to the property owner including retention of possession of the mobile home and foreclosure thereon to satisfy the landlord’s lien for rent. (4) In the event that the lienholder files either an action for replevin of the home or forecloses on the lien for unpaid purchase price or first lien, the lienholder is responsible for storage charges accrued from 30 days after the date of filing of the action for replevin or foreclosure. (5) In the event that the homeowner declares bankruptcy, the lienholder is responsible for storage charges accrued from and after 5 days after the final court action discharging the bankruptcy, or releasing the collateral, whichever occurs first. (6) The maximum storage charge available to the real property owner is a daily rate equal to one-thirtieth of the amount of the monthly payment last paid by the homeowner, the then-current lot rental amount paid by the homeowner, or if no payment has been made, the payment required pursuant to contract between the real property owner and the homeowner. The maximum daily storage charges may be increased over time in accordance with the notice requirements under applicable provisions of Florida law, including, but not limited to, this chapter. (7) Notice required as set forth in subsection (2) shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice by certified mail shall be effective on the date of receipt or, if refused, on the date of refusal. All other notices may be by regular mail, and will, for purposes of calculation of time, be considered delivered 5 days after the date postmarked. (8) For any lien for unpaid purchase price or first lien recorded after April 8, 1992, the lienholder shall notify the property owner of the lien against the mobile home and the address of the lienholder. (9) It shall be unlawful for the property owner to refuse to allow the lienholder to repossess and move the mobile home for failure to pay any charges which were not noticed in accordance with the requirements of this section. In the event that the real property owner refuses to allow the lienholder to repossess and move the mobile home, then the real property owner shall be liable to the lienholder for each day that the real property owner unlawfully maintains possession of the home, at a daily rate equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly payment last paid by the homeowner to the real property owner, or, if no payment has been made, the payment required pursuant to contract between the real property owner and the homeowner.
