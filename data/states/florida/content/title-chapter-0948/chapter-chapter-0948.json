      "text": "948.03 Terms and conditions of probation.— (1) The court shall determine the terms and conditions of probation. Conditions specified in this section do not require oral pronouncement at the time of sentencing and may be considered standard conditions of probation. These conditions may include among them the following, that the probationer or offender in community control shall: (a) Report to the probation officer as directed. Such reporting requirements may be fulfilled through remote reporting if approved by the relevant probation officer, the relevant county probation authority or entity, or the Department of Corrections and if the court has not excluded the possibility of remote reporting by the defendant in his or her order of probation. If the Department of Corrections or a county probation authority or entity elects to authorize remote reporting, it must adopt and make available remote probation reporting policies. (b) Permit the probation officer to visit him or her at his or her home or elsewhere. (c) Work faithfully at suitable employment insofar as may be possible. (d) Remain within a specified place. (e) Live without violating any law. A conviction in a court of law is not necessary for such a violation of law to constitute a violation of probation, community control, or any other form of court-ordered supervision. (f) Make reparation or restitution to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by his or her offense in an amount to be determined by the court. The court shall make such reparation or restitution a condition of probation, unless it determines that clear and compelling reasons exist to the contrary. If the court does not order restitution, or orders restitution of only a portion of the damages, as provided in s. 775.089, it shall state on the record in detail the reasons therefor. (g) Effective July 1, 1994, and applicable for offenses committed on or after that date, make payment of the debt due and owing to a county or municipal detention facility under s. 951.032 for medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation received by the felony probationer while in that detention facility. The court, in determining whether to order such repayment and the amount of the repayment, shall consider the amount of the debt, whether there was any fault of the institution for the medical expenses incurred, the financial resources of the felony probationer, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the probationer, and dependents, and other appropriate factors. (h) Support his or her legal dependents to the best of his or her ability. (i) Make payment of the debt due and owing to the state under s. 960.17, subject to modification based on change of circumstances. (j) Pay any application fee assessed under s. 27.52(1)(b) and attorney’s fees and costs assessed under s. 938.29, subject to modification based on change of circumstances. (k) Not associate with persons engaged in criminal activities. (l)1. Submit to random testing as directed by the probation officer or the professional staff of the treatment center where he or she is receiving treatment to determine the presence or use of alcohol or controlled substances. 2. If the offense was a controlled substance violation and the period of probation immediately follows a period of incarceration in the state correctional system, the conditions must include a requirement that the offender submit to random substance abuse testing intermittently throughout the term of supervision, upon the direction of the probation officer. (m) Be prohibited from possessing, carrying, or owning any: 1. Firearm. 2. Weapon without first procuring the consent of the probation officer. (n) Be prohibited from using intoxicants to excess or possessing any drugs or narcotics unless prescribed by a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant. The probationer or community controllee may not knowingly visit places where intoxicants, drugs, or other dangerous substances are unlawfully sold, dispensed, or used. (o) Submit to the drawing of blood or other biological specimens as prescribed in ss. 943.325 and 948.014, and reimburse the appropriate agency for the costs of drawing and transmitting the blood or other biological specimens to the Department of Law Enforcement. (p) Submit to the taking of a digitized photograph by the department as a part of the offender’s records. This photograph may be displayed on the department’s public website while the offender is under court-ordered supervision. However, the department may not display the photograph on the website if the offender is only on pretrial intervention supervision or if the offender’s identity is exempt from disclosure due to an exemption from the requirements of s. 119.07. (2) The enumeration of specific kinds of terms and conditions does not prevent the court from adding thereto such other or others as it considers proper. However, the sentencing court may only impose a condition of supervision allowing an offender convicted of s. 794.011, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, s. 847.0135(5), or s. 847.0145 to reside in another state if the order stipulates that it is contingent upon the approval of the receiving state interstate compact authority. The court may rescind or modify at any time the terms and conditions theretofore imposed by it upon the probationer. However, if the court withholds adjudication of guilt or imposes a period of incarceration as a condition of probation, the period may not exceed 364 days, and incarceration shall be restricted to either a county facility, or a probation and restitution center under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.

      "text": "948.08 Pretrial intervention program.— (1) The department shall supervise pretrial intervention programs for persons charged with a crime, before or after any information has been filed or an indictment has been returned in the circuit court. Such programs shall provide appropriate counseling, education, supervision, and medical and psychological treatment as available and when appropriate for the persons released to such programs. (2) Any first offender, or any person previously convicted of not more than one nonviolent misdemeanor, who is charged with any misdemeanor or felony of the third degree is eligible for release to the pretrial intervention program on the approval of the administrator of the program and the consent of the victim, the state attorney, and the judge who presided at the initial appearance hearing of the offender. However, the defendant may not be released to the pretrial intervention program unless, after consultation with his or her attorney, he or she has voluntarily agreed to such program and has knowingly and intelligently waived his or her right to a speedy trial for the period of his or her diversion. The defendant or the defendant’s immediate family may not personally contact the victim or the victim’s immediate family to acquire the victim’s consent under this section. (3) The criminal charges against an offender admitted to the program shall be continued without final disposition for a period of 90 days after the date the offender was released to the program, if the offender’s participation in the program is satisfactory, and for an additional 90 days upon the request of the program administrator and consent of the state attorney, if the offender’s participation in the program is satisfactory. (4) Resumption of pending criminal proceedings shall be undertaken at any time if the program administrator or state attorney finds that the offender is not fulfilling his or her obligations under this plan or if the public interest so requires. The court may not appoint the public defender to represent an indigent offender released to the pretrial intervention program unless the offender’s release is revoked and the offender is subject to imprisonment if convicted. (5) At the end of the intervention period, the administrator shall recommend: (a) That the case revert to normal channels for prosecution in instances in which the offender’s participation in the program has been unsatisfactory; (b) That the offender is in need of further supervision; or (c) That dismissal of charges without prejudice shall be entered in instances in which prosecution is not deemed necessary. The state attorney shall make the final determination as to whether the prosecution shall continue. (6)(a) For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonviolent felony” means a third degree felony violation of chapter 810 or any other felony offense that is not a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08. (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a person is eligible for voluntary admission into a pretrial substance abuse education and treatment intervention program, including a treatment-based drug court program established pursuant to s. 397.334, approved by the chief judge of the circuit, for a period to be determined by the court, based on the clinical needs of the defendant, if he or she: 1. Is identified as having a substance abuse problem and is amenable to treatment. 2. Is charged with a nonviolent felony. 3. Is not also charged with a crime involving violence, including, but not limited to, murder, sexual battery, robbery, carjacking, home-invasion robbery, or any other crime involving violence. 4. Has two or fewer felony convictions, provided that the prior convictions are for nonviolent felonies. (c) Upon motion of either party or the court’s own motion, and with the agreement of the defendant, the court shall admit an eligible person into a pretrial substance abuse education and treatment intervention program, except: 1. If the state attorney believes that the facts and circumstances of the case suggest the defendant’s involvement in the dealing and selling of controlled substances, the court shall hold a preadmission hearing. If the state attorney establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence at such hearing, that the defendant was involved in the dealing or selling of controlled substances, the court shall deny the defendant’s admission into a pretrial intervention program. 2. If the defendant has two or fewer prior felony convictions as provided in subparagraph (b)4., the court, in its discretion, may deny admission to such a program. (d) While enrolled in a pretrial intervention program authorized by this subsection, the participant is subject to a coordinated strategy developed by a drug court team under s. 397.334(4). The coordinated strategy may include a protocol of sanctions that may be imposed upon the participant for noncompliance with program rules. The protocol of sanctions may include, but is not limited to, placement in a substance abuse treatment program offered by a licensed service provider as defined in s. 397.311 or in a jail-based treatment program or serving a period of incarceration within the time limits established for contempt of court. The coordinated strategy must be provided in writing to the participant before the participant agrees to enter into a pretrial treatment-based drug court program or other pretrial intervention program. Any person whose charges are dismissed after successful completion of the treatment-based drug court program, if otherwise eligible, may have his or her arrest record and plea of nolo contendere to the dismissed charges expunged under s. 943.0585. (e) At the end of the pretrial intervention period, the court shall consider the recommendation of the program administrator pursuant to subsection (5) and the recommendation of the state attorney as to disposition of the pending charges. The court shall determine, by written finding, whether the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. Notwithstanding the coordinated strategy developed by a drug court team pursuant to s. 397.334(4), if the court finds that the defendant has not successfully completed the pretrial intervention program, the court may order the person to continue in education and treatment, which may include substance abuse treatment programs offered by licensed service providers as defined in s. 397.311 or jail-based treatment programs, or order that the charges revert to normal channels for prosecution. The court shall dismiss the charges upon a finding that the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. (f) Any entity, whether public or private, providing a pretrial substance abuse education and treatment intervention program under this subsection must contract with the county or appropriate governmental entity, and the terms of the contract must include, but need not be limited to, the requirements established for private entities under s. 948.15(3). (7)(a) A person who is charged with a felony, other than a felony listed in s. 948.06(8)(c), and who is identified as a veteran or a servicemember, as defined in s. 394.47891(2)(d) or (c), respectively, and is otherwise qualified to participate in a veterans treatment court program under s. 394.47891 is eligible for admission into a veterans treatment court program pursuant to the requirements of s. 394.47891(4) and (8). (b) While enrolled in a pretrial intervention program authorized by this subsection, the participant shall be subject to a coordinated strategy developed by a veterans’ treatment intervention team. The coordinated strategy should be modeled after the therapeutic jurisprudence principles and key components in s. 397.334(4), with treatment specific to the needs of servicemembers and veterans. The coordinated strategy may include a protocol of sanctions that may be imposed upon the participant for noncompliance with program rules. The protocol of sanctions may include, but need not be limited to, placement in a treatment program offered by a licensed service provider or in a jail-based treatment program or serving a period of incarceration within the time limits established for contempt of court. The coordinated strategy must be provided in writing to the participant before the participant agrees to enter into a pretrial veterans’ treatment intervention program or other pretrial intervention program. Any person whose charges are dismissed after successful completion of the pretrial veterans’ treatment intervention program, if otherwise eligible, may have his or her arrest record of the dismissed charges expunged under s. 943.0585. (c) At the end of the pretrial intervention period, the court shall consider the recommendation of the program administrator and the recommendation of the state attorney as to disposition of the pending charges. The court shall determine, by written finding, whether the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. If the court finds that the defendant has not successfully completed the pretrial intervention program, the court may order the person to continue in education and treatment, which may include treatment programs offered by licensed service providers or jail-based treatment programs, or order that the charges revert to normal channels for prosecution. The court shall dismiss the charges upon a finding that the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. (8)(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a defendant is eligible for voluntary admission into a pretrial mental health court program established pursuant to s. 394.47892 and approved by the chief judge of the circuit for a period to be determined by the court, based on the clinical needs of the defendant, upon motion of either party or the court’s own motion if: 1. The defendant is identified as having a mental illness; and 2. The defendant is charged with: a. A nonviolent felony that includes a third degree felony violation of chapter 810 or any other felony offense that is not a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08; b. Resisting an officer with violence under s. 843.01, if the law enforcement officer and state attorney consent to the defendant’s participation; c. Battery on a law enforcement officer under s. 784.07, if the law enforcement officer and state attorney consent to the defendant’s participation; or d. Aggravated assault, if the victim and state attorney consent to the defendant’s participation. (b) At the end of the pretrial intervention period, the court shall consider the recommendation of the program administrator and the recommendation of the state attorney as to disposition of the pending charges. The court shall determine, by written finding, whether the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. If the court finds that the defendant has not successfully completed the pretrial intervention program, the court may order the person to continue in education and treatment, which may include a mental health program offered by a licensed service provider, as defined in s. 394.455, or order that the charges revert to normal channels for prosecution. The court shall dismiss the charges upon a finding that the defendant has successfully completed the pretrial intervention program. (9) The department may contract for the services and facilities necessary to operate pretrial intervention programs.

This program shall be rigidly structured and designed to accommodate offenders who, in the absence of such a program, would have been incarcerated in a jail or prison. The program shall focus on the provision of home confinement subject to an authorized level of limited freedom and special conditions that are commensurate with the seriousness of the crime. The program shall offer the courts and the Florida Commission on Offender Review an alternative, community-based method to punish an offender in lieu of incarceration and shall provide intensive supervision to closely monitor compliance with restrictions and special conditions, including, but not limited to, treatment or rehabilitative programs. The targeted population for this community control program includes: (a) Probation violators charged with technical violations or new violations of law. (b) Parole or conditional release violators charged with technical violations or new violations of law. (c) Individuals found guilty of felonies who, due to their criminal backgrounds or the seriousness of the offenses, would not be placed on regular probation. (2) Caseloads should be restricted to a maximum of 30 cases per officer in order to ensure an adequate level of staffing. Community control is an individualized program in which the offender is restricted to a residential treatment facility or a nursing facility or restricted to his or her approved residence subject to an authorized level of limited freedom. (3) Procedures governing violations of community control are the same as those described in s. 948.06 with respect to probation. (4) Upon completion of the sanctions imposed and before the expiration of the community control term ordered by the court, the department may petition the court to terminate early the supervision of the offender from community control supervision or to return the offender to a program of regular probation supervision for the remainder of the term. In considering the petition, the court should recognize the limited staff resources committed to the community control program, the purpose of the program, and the offender’s successful compliance with the conditions set forth in the order of the court.

The court shall require intensive supervision and surveillance for an offender placed into community control, which may include, but is not limited to: (a) Specified contact with the parole and probation officer. (b) Confinement to an agreed-upon residence during hours away from employment and public service activities. (c) Mandatory public service. (d) Supervision by the Department of Corrections by means of an electronic monitoring device or system. (e) The standard conditions of probation set forth in s. 948.03. (2) The enumeration of specific kinds of terms and conditions does not prevent the court from adding any other terms or conditions that the court considers proper. However, the sentencing court may only impose a condition of supervision allowing an offender convicted of s. 794.011, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, s. 847.0135(5), or s. 847.0145 to reside in another state if the order stipulates that it is contingent upon the approval of the receiving state interstate compact authority. The court may rescind or modify at any time the terms and conditions theretofore imposed by it upon the offender in community control. However, if the court withholds adjudication of guilt or imposes a period of incarceration as a condition of community control, the period may not exceed 364 days, and incarceration shall be restricted to a county facility, a probation and restitution center under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, or a residential treatment facility owned or operated by any entity providing such services.

All reports of noncompliance shall be immediately investigated by a probation officer. (4) The Department of Corrections may contract with local law enforcement agencies to assist in the location and apprehension of offenders who are in noncompliance as reported by the electronic monitoring system. This contract is intended to provide the department a means for providing immediate investigation of noncompliance reports, especially after normal office hours. (5) Any person being electronically monitored by the department as a result of being placed on supervision shall pay the department for the electronic monitoring services as provided in s. 948.09(2). (6) For probationers, community controllees, or conditional releasees who have current or prior convictions for violent or sexual offenses, the department, in carrying out a court or commission order to electronically monitor an offender, must use a system that actively monitors and identifies the offender’s location and timely reports or records the offender’s presence near or within a crime scene or in a prohibited area or the offender’s departure from specified geographic limitations.

In either case, the court may also stay and withhold the imposition of sentence and place the defendant on drug offender probation or into a postadjudicatory treatment-based drug court program if the defendant otherwise qualifies. As used in this section, the term “nonviolent felony” means a third degree felony violation under chapter 810 or any other felony offense that is not a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08. (2) The Department of Corrections shall develop and administer a drug offender probation program which emphasizes a combination of treatment and intensive community supervision approaches and which includes provision for supervision of offenders in accordance with a specific treatment plan. The program may include the use of graduated sanctions consistent with the conditions imposed by the court. Drug offender probation status shall include surveillance and random drug testing, and may include those measures normally associated with community control, except that specific treatment conditions and other treatment approaches necessary to monitor this population may be ordered.

It is further intended that such programs provide increased opportunities for offenders to make restitution to victims of crime through financial reimbursement or community service, while promoting efficiency and economy in the delivery of correctional services. (2) In the event that a city or county or a combination thereof elects to develop, establish, and maintain such community program, it shall provide support to a local offender advisory council composed of members appointed by the city or county governing body; if a council is established by more than one local government, an equal number of members shall be appointed by each participating governing body. Each council shall also include in its membership two persons appointed by the chief judge of the circuit serving the jurisdiction or jurisdictions participating on the committee and one person appointed by the appropriate regional office of the Department of Corrections. Each such council shall be responsible for: (a) Identifying and developing community services and programs for use by the courts in diverting offenders from state correctional institutions. (b) Providing a mechanism whereby all offenders with needs for services will be linked to appropriate agencies and individuals. (c) Upon referral to the council by the circuit court, determining if an appropriate behavioral contract can be developed with an offender in a community program as an alternative to incarceration, and providing findings and recommendations to the referring judge.
