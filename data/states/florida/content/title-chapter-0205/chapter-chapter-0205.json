(b) Unless the county implements s. 205.0535 or adopts a new business tax ordinance under s. 205.0315, a business tax levied under this subsection may not exceed the rate provided by this chapter in effect for the year beginning October 1, 1971; however, beginning October 1, 1980, the county governing body may increase business taxes authorized by this chapter. The amount of the increase above the tax rate levied on October 1, 1971, for taxes levied at a flat rate may be up to 100 percent for business taxes that are $100 or less; 50 percent for business taxes that are between $101 and $300; and 25 percent for business taxes that are more than $300. Beginning October 1, 1982, the increase may not exceed 25 percent for taxes levied at graduated or per unit rates. Authority to increase business taxes does not apply to licenses or receipts granted to any utility franchised by the county for which a franchise fee is paid. (c) A receipt is not valid for more than 1 year, and all receipts expire on September 30 of each year, except as otherwise provided by law. (2) Any receipt may be transferred to a new owner, when there is a bona fide sale of the business, upon payment of a transfer fee of up to 10 percent of the annual business tax, but not less than $3 nor more than $25, and presentation of the original receipt and evidence of the sale. (3) Upon written request and presentation of the original receipt, any receipt may be transferred from one location to another location in the same county upon payment of a transfer fee of up to 10 percent of the annual business tax, but not less than $3 nor more than $25. (4) The revenues derived from the business tax, exclusive of the costs of collection and any credit given for municipal business taxes, shall be apportioned between the unincorporated area of the county and the incorporated municipalities located therein by a ratio derived by dividing their respective populations by the population of the county. This subsection does not apply to counties that have established a new rate structure under s. 205.0535. (5) The revenues so apportioned shall be sent to the governing authority of each municipality, according to its ratio, and to the governing authority of the county, according to the ratio of the unincorporated area, within 15 days following the month of receipt. This subsection does not apply to counties that have established a new rate structure under s. 205.0535. (6)(a) Each county, as defined in s. 125.011(1), or any county adjacent thereto may levy and collect, by an ordinance enacted by the governing body of the county, an additional business tax up to 50 percent of the appropriate business tax imposed under subsection (1). (b) Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply to any revenues derived from the additional tax imposed under this subsection. Proceeds from the additional business tax must be placed in a separate interest-earning account, and the governing body of the county shall distribute this revenue, plus accrued interest, each fiscal year to an organization or agency designated by the governing body of the county to oversee and implement a comprehensive economic development strategy through advertising, promotional activities, and other sales and marketing techniques. (c) An ordinance that levies an additional business tax under this subsection may not be adopted after January 1, 1995. (7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the revenue received from a county business tax may be used for overseeing and implementing a comprehensive economic development strategy through advertising, promotional activities, and other sales and marketing techniques.

A person who is engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service or a pay telephone service in a municipality or in the unincorporated area of a county and who pays the business tax under the category designated for telephone companies or a pay telephone service provider certified pursuant to s. 364.3375 is deemed to have but one place of business or business location in each municipality or unincorporated area of a county. Pay telephone service providers may not be assessed a business tax on a per-instrument basis. (2) Before adopting a reclassification and revision ordinance, the municipality or county must establish an equity study commission and appoint its members. Each member of the study commission must be a representative of the business community within the local government’s jurisdiction. Each equity study commission shall recommend to the appropriate local government a classification system and rate structure for business taxes. (3)(a) After the reclassification and rate structure revisions have been transmitted to and considered by the appropriate local governing body, it may adopt by majority vote a new business tax ordinance. Except that a minimum tax of up to $25 is permitted, the reclassification may not increase the tax by more than the following: for receipts costing $150 or less, 200 percent; for receipts costing more than $150 but not more than $500, 100 percent; for receipts costing more than $500 but not more than $2,500, 75 percent; for receipts costing more than $2,500 but not more than $10,000, 50 percent; and for receipts costing more than $10,000, 10 percent; however, in no case may the tax on any receipt be increased more than $5,000. (b) The total annual revenue generated by the new rate structure for the fiscal year following the fiscal year during which the rate structure is adopted may not exceed: 1. For municipalities, the sum of the revenue base and 10 percent of that revenue base. The revenue base is the sum of the business tax revenue generated by receipts issued for the most recently completed local fiscal year or the amount of revenue that would have been generated from the authorized increases under s. 205.043(1)(b), whichever is greater, plus any revenue received from the county under s. 205.033(4). 2. For counties, the sum of the revenue base, 10 percent of that revenue base, and the amount of revenue distributed by the county to the municipalities under s. 205.033(4) during the most recently completed local fiscal year. The revenue base is the business tax revenue generated by receipts issued for the most recently completed local fiscal year or the amount of revenue that would have been generated from the authorized increases under s. 205.033(1)(b), whichever is greater, but may not include any revenues distributed to municipalities under s. 205.033(4). (c) In addition to the revenue increases authorized by paragraph (b), revenue increases attributed to the increases in the number of receipts issued are authorized. (4) After the conditions specified in subsections (2) and (3) are met, municipalities and counties may, every other year thereafter, increase or decrease by ordinance the rates of business taxes by up to 5 percent. However, an increase must be enacted by at least a majority plus one vote of the governing body. (5) This chapter does not prohibit a municipality or county from decreasing or repealing any business tax authorized under this chapter. By majority vote, the governing body of a county or municipality may adopt an ordinance repealing a local business tax or establishing new rates that decrease local business taxes and do not result in an increase in local business taxes for a taxpayer. Such ordinances are not subject to subsections (2) and (3). (6) A receipt may not be issued unless the federal employer identification number or social security number is obtained from the person to be taxed.

The business tax for vending and amusement machines must be assessed based on the highest number of machines located on the business premises on any single day during the previous receipted year or, in the case of new businesses, be based on an estimate for the current year. Replacement of one vending machine with another machine during a receipted year does not affect the tax assessment for that year, unless the replacement machine belongs to a business tax classification that requires a higher tax rate. For the first year in which a municipality or county assesses a business tax on vending machines, each business owning machines located in the municipality or county must notify the municipality or county, upon request, of the location of such machines. Each business owning machines must provide notice of the provisions of this section to each affected business premises where the machines are located. The business premises must secure the receipt if it is not otherwise secured. History.—s. 10, ch. 93-180; s. 14, ch. 2006-152.
