The petition shall set forth with particularity the manner in which the department has failed to implement the decision of the Administration Commission, including any required remedial actions. The authority has 45 days after receipt of a verified petition to either initiate an action in circuit court pursuant to this section or advise the inmate in writing of the reason such an action will not be initiated.(3)Within 30 days after service of the written decision of the authority setting forth its reason why an action will not be initiated by the authority pursuant to this section, an inmate may initiate an appropriate proceeding in the Circuit Court in Leon County to require the department to substantially comply with the decision of the Administration Commission.History.—s. 7, ch. 92-47.",
