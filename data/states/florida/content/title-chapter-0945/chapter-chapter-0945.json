(p) Notwithstanding s. 456.057 and in accordance with 45 C.F.R. part 164, subpart E, protected health information and mental health, medical, or substance abuse records specified in paragraph (1)(a) of a deceased inmate or offender to an individual with authority to act on behalf of the deceased inmate or offender, upon the individual’s request. For purposes of this section, the following individuals have authority to act on behalf of a deceased inmate or offender only for the purpose of requesting access to such protected health information and records: 1. A person appointed by a court to act as the personal representative, executor, administrator, curator, or temporary administrator of the deceased inmate’s or offender’s estate; 2. If a court has not made a judicial appointment under subparagraph 1., a person designated by the inmate or offender to act as his or her personal representative in a last will that is self-proved under s. 732.503; or 3. If a court has not made a judicial appointment under subparagraph 1. or if the inmate or offender has not designated a person in a self-proved last will as provided in subparagraph 2., only the following individuals: a. A surviving spouse. b. If there is no surviving spouse, a surviving adult child of the inmate or offender. c. If there is no surviving spouse or adult child, a parent of the inmate or offender. (q) All requests for access to a deceased inmate’s or offender’s protected health information or mental health, medical, or substance abuse records specified in paragraph (1)(a) must be in writing and must be accompanied by the following: 1. If made by a person authorized under subparagraph (p)1., a copy of the letter of administration and a copy of the court order appointing such person as the representative of the inmate’s or offender’s estate. 2. If made by a person authorized under subparagraph (p)2., a copy of the self-proved last will designating the person as the inmate’s or offender’s representative. 3. If made by a person authorized under subparagraph (p)3., a letter from the person’s attorney verifying the person’s relationship to the inmate or offender and the absence of a court-appointed representative and self-proved last will. Records and information released under this subsection remain confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution when held by the receiving person or entity. (3) Due to substantial concerns regarding institutional security and unreasonable and excessive demands on personnel and resources if an inmate or an offender has unlimited or routine access to records of the Department of Corrections, an inmate or an offender who is under the jurisdiction of the department may not have unrestricted access to the department’s records or to information contained in the department’s records. However, except as to another inmate’s or offender’s records, the department may permit limited access to its records if an inmate or an offender makes a written request and demonstrates an exceptional need for information contained in the department’s records and the information is otherwise unavailable. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to: (a) The inmate or offender requests documentation to resolve a conflict between the inmate’s court documentation and the commitment papers or court orders received by the department regarding the inmate or offender. (b) The inmate’s or offender’s release is forthcoming and a prospective employer requests, in writing, documentation of the inmate’s or offender’s work performance. (c) The inmate or offender needs information concerning the amount of victim restitution paid during the inmate’s or offender’s incarceration. (d) The requested records contain information required to process an application or claim by the inmate or offender with the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Commerce, or any other similar application or claim with a state agency or federal agency. (e) The inmate or offender wishes to obtain the current address of a relative whose address is in the department’s records and the relative has not indicated a desire not to be contacted by the inmate or offender. (f) Other similar circumstances that do not present a threat to the security, order, or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or to any person’s safety. (4) The Department of Corrections shall adopt rules to prevent disclosure of confidential records or information to unauthorized persons.

(2) The Department of Corrections is authorized to enter into agreements with the controlling authorities of such state institutions which have or are provided with appropriate facilities for the secure confinement and treatment of substance abuse impaired persons, mentally ill persons, and tuberculous persons. In any such agreement, the department shall provide for custodial personnel to maintain proper security of persons transferred from the correctional system to any other state institution. Such custodial personnel shall be employed and paid by the department and subject to rules such as are agreed upon jointly by it and the controlling authority entering into such agreement. (3) The department shall reimburse the institution furnishing treatment at a figure agreed upon by it and the controlling authority of such institution. (4) When, in the opinion of the superintendent of an institution to which a prisoner has been transferred, such prisoner has been cured, or will no longer benefit from treatment at that institution, other than a mentally ill prisoner, the superintendent shall notify the department which shall, at the earliest practicable date thereafter, convey such prisoner to the appropriate classification center for reclassification. (5) When the department plans to release an offender who is mentally ill or intellectually disabled, an involuntary commitment hearing shall be held as soon as possible before his or her release in accordance with chapter 393 or chapter 394. (6) A prisoner who has been determined by the Department of Children and Families and the Department of Corrections to be amenable to rehabilitative treatment for sexual deviation, and who has voluntarily agreed to participate in such rehabilitative treatment, may be transferred to the Department of Children and Families provided appropriate bed space is available.

An inmate who is known to the department to be HIV positive or who has been tested within the previous year and does not request retesting need not be tested under this section but is subject to subsections (4) and (5). However, an inmate who is released due to an emergency is exempt from the provisions of this section. (3) The department shall record the results of the HIV test in the inmate’s medical record. (4) Pursuant to ss. 381.004(2) and 945.10, the department shall notify the Department of Health and the county health department where the inmate plans to reside regarding an inmate who is known to be HIV positive or has received an HIV positive test result under this section prior to the release of that inmate. (5) Prior to the release of an inmate who is known to be HIV positive or who has received a positive HIV test result under this section, the department shall provide special transitional assistance to the inmate, which must include: (a) Education on preventing the transmission of HIV to others and on the importance of receiving followup care and treatment. (b) A written, individualized discharge plan that includes referrals to and contacts with the county health department and local HIV primary care services in the area where the inmate plans to reside. (c) A 30-day supply of all HIV/AIDS-related medications that the inmate is taking prior to release under the protocols of the Department of Corrections and the treatment guidelines of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (6) Notwithstanding any provision of the Florida Statutes providing for a waiver of sovereign immunity, neither the state, its agencies, subdivisions nor employees of the state, its agencies, or subdivisions shall be liable to any person for negligently causing death or personal injury arising out of complying with this section.

An emergency treatment order for psychotropic medication may be provided to the inmate upon the written order of a physician licensed pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459 in an emergency not exceeding 72 hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays. An emergency exists when an inmate with a mental illness presents an immediate threat of: (a) Bodily harm to self or others; or (b) Extreme deterioration in behavioral functioning secondary to the mental illness. (2) PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION.—Psychotropic medication may be administered only when the medication constitutes an appropriate treatment for a mental illness and its symptoms and alternative treatments are not available or indicated, or would not be effective. If after the 72-hour period the inmate has not given express and informed consent to the medication initially refused, the inmate’s treating physician shall refer the inmate to a mental health treatment facility for an involuntary examination in accordance with the procedures described in s. 945.43. Upon such referral, the warden shall, within 48 hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, transfer the inmate to a mental health treatment facility. Upon transfer of the inmate for an involuntary examination, the emergency treatment order may be continued upon the written order of a physician as long as the physician has determined that the emergency continues to present a danger to the safety of the inmate or others and the criteria described in this subsection are satisfied. If psychotropic medication is still recommended after the emergency, it may only be administered after following the procedures outlined in s. 945.44. (3) USE OF FORCE.—An employee or agent of the department is authorized to apply physical force upon an inmate when and to the extent that it reasonably appears necessary to effectuate the treatment of an inmate as described in this section, for the application of psychiatric restraint, to effectuate clinically necessary hygiene, or pursuant to a valid court order issued under s. 945.44 or s. 945.485.

      "text": "945.485 Management and treatment for self-injurious behaviors.— (1) The Legislature finds that nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors in correctional institutions, or acts intended to cause bodily harm but not death, have increased in the correctional environment. Self-injurious behavior may include nonsuicidal self-injury or self-mutilation, such as cutting, reopening wounds, and ingesting or inserting foreign objects or dangerous instruments into the body. These behaviors pose a significant threat to inmates, staff, and, in many cases, the safe and secure operation of the correctional institution. In addition, self-injurious behaviors, coupled with repeated refusals to provide express and informed consent for medical treatment and care, are a significant challenge for correctional medical and mental health professionals, resulting in higher costs for medical services, and may result in inadvertent mortality in the incarcerated population. (2) In accordance with s. 945.6042, the Legislature finds that an inmate retains the fundamental right of self-determination regarding decisions pertaining to his or her own health, including the right to choose or refuse medical treatment or life-saving medical procedures. However, the inmate’s right to privacy and decisionmaking regarding medical treatment may be outweighed by compelling state interests. (3) When an inmate is engaging in active or ongoing self-injurious behavior and has refused to provide express and informed consent for treatment related to the self-injurious behavior, the warden of the facility where the inmate is housed shall consult with the inmate’s treating physician regarding the inmate’s medical and mental health status, current medical and mental health treatment needs, and competency to provide express and informed consent for treatment. The warden shall also determine whether the inmate’s self-injurious behavior presents a danger to the safety of department staff or other inmates or the security, internal order, or discipline of the institution. (a) If the inmate’s treating physician determines that the inmate has a mental illness and is incompetent to consent to treatment, the physician shall proceed in accordance with s. 945.6042 for any necessary surgical or medical services. If the inmate is in need of care and treatment as defined in s. 945.42, the inmate shall be referred to a mental health treatment facility for an involuntary examination in accordance with s. 945.44. (b) If the inmate is competent, refusing necessary surgical or medical treatment, and engaging in active or ongoing self-injurious behavior that presents a threat to the safety of department staff or other inmates or the security, internal order, or discipline of the institution, the warden shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection (4). (4)(a) The warden, or his or her designated representative, shall, on behalf of the state, petition the circuit court of the county in which the inmate is residing or the county in which the inmate is hospitalized for an order compelling the inmate to submit to emergency surgical intervention or other medical services to the extent necessary to remedy the threat to the safety of staff or other inmates or the security, internal order, or discipline of the institution. The petition must be supported by the expert opinion of at least one of the inmate’s treating physicians and may be supported by other staff as necessary. (b) The inmate shall be provided with a copy of the petition along with the proposed intervention; the basis for the proposed intervention; the names of the testifying experts and witnesses; and the date, time, and location of the hearing. After considering the medical status of the inmate, public safety, and security concerns presented by transporting the inmate, the court may order that the hearing be conducted by electronic means or in person at the institution or at another location designated by the court. If the hearing is ordered by the court to be conducted at a location other than the institution, the department is authorized to transport the inmate to the location of the hearing. (c) The inmate may have an attorney represent him or her at the hearing, and, if the inmate is indigent, the court shall appoint the office of the public defender or private counsel pursuant to s. 27.40(1) to represent the inmate at the hearing. An attorney representing the inmate shall have access to the inmate and any records, including medical or mental health records, which are relevant to the representation of the inmate. (d) The hearing on the petition shall be held as expeditiously as possible after the petition is filed, but no later than 5 calendar days after filing. The court may appoint a general or special magistrate to preside. The inmate may testify or not, as he or she chooses; may cross-examine witnesses testifying on behalf of the institution; and may present his or her own witnesses. (e) The court may waive the presence of the inmate at the hearing if the waiver is consistent with the best interests of the inmate and the inmate’s counsel does not object. (f) The court shall determine whether the warden has established, by clear and convincing evidence, a compelling state interest sufficient to outweigh the inmate’s right to refuse treatment. The court shall consider all of the following: 1. Preservation of the life of the inmate. 2. Prevention of suicide. 3. Protection of innocent third parties. 4. Maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession. 5. Preservation of the security, internal order, or discipline of the institution. 6. Rehabilitation of the inmate. 7. Any other compelling state interest. (g) If the court determines that there are compelling state interests sufficient to override the inmate’s right to refuse treatment, the court shall enter an order authorizing emergency surgical intervention or other medical services, narrowly tailored and in the least intrusive manner possible, only as necessary to remedy the threat to the safety of third parties or the security, internal order, or discipline of the institution. Emergency surgical intervention or other medical services authorized by the court may be carried out at the institution or at a licensed hospital, as applicable. (5) This section does not repeal by implication any provision of s. 766.103, the Florida Medical Consent Law, or s. 768.13, the Good Samaritan Act. For all purposes, the Florida Medical Consent Law and the Good Samaritan Act shall be considered alternatives to this section. History.—s. 16, ch. 2025-81.

      "text": "945.604 Medical claims.— (1) DEFINITION OF “CLAIM.”—As used in this section, for a noninstitutional health care provider the term “claim” means a paper or electronic billing instrument submitted to the department which consists of the HCFA 1500 data set, or its successor, and has all mandatory entries for a physician licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, or chapter 463 or a psychologist licensed under chapter 490, or any appropriate billing instrument that has all mandatory entries for any other noninstitutional health care provider. For an institutional health care provider, the term “claim” means a paper or electronic billing instrument submitted to the department which consists of the UB-92 data set, or its successor, with entries stated as mandatory by the National Uniform Billing Committee. (2) SUBMISSION DATE.—Claims for payment or underpayment are considered submitted on the date the claim for payment is mailed or electronically transferred to the department by the health care provider. Claims for overpayment are considered submitted on the date the claim for overpayment is mailed or electronically transferred to the health care provider by the department. (3) CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT OR UNDERPAYMENT.— (a) Claims for payment or underpayment must be submitted to the department within 6 months after the following have occurred: 1. The discharge of the inmate for inpatient services rendered to the inmate or the date of service for outpatient services rendered to the inmate; and 2. The health care provider has been furnished with the correct name and address of the department. (b) Claims for payment or underpayment must not duplicate a claim previously submitted unless it is determined the original claim was not received or is otherwise lost. (c) The department is not obligated to pay claims for payment or underpayment which were not submitted in accordance with paragraph (a). (4) CLAIMS FOR OVERPAYMENT.— (a) If the department determines that it has made an overpayment to a health care provider for services rendered to an inmate, it must make a claim for such overpayment to the provider’s designated location. The department shall provide a written or electronic statement specifying the basis for overpayment. The department must identify the claim or claims, or overpayment claim portion thereof, for which a claim for overpayment is submitted. (b) The department must submit a claim for overpayment to a health care provider within 30 months after the department’s payment of the claim, except that claims for overpayment may be submitted beyond that time from providers convicted of fraud pursuant to s. 817.234. (c) Health care providers are not obligated to pay claims for overpayment which were not submitted in accordance with paragraph (b). (d) A health care provider must pay, deny, or contest the department’s claim for overpayment within 40 days after the receipt of the claim for overpayment. (e) A health care provider that denies or contests the department’s claim for overpayment or any portion of a claim shall notify the department, in writing, within 40 days after the provider receives the claim. The notice that the claim for overpayment is denied or contested must identify the contested portion of the claim and the specific reason for contesting or denying the claim and, if contested, must include a request for additional information. (f) All contested claims for overpayment must be paid or denied within 120 days after receipt of the claim. Failure to pay or deny the claim for overpayment within 140 days after receipt creates an uncontestable obligation to pay the claim. (g) The department may not reduce payment to the health care provider for other services unless the provider agrees to the reduction or fails to respond to the department’s claim for overpayment as required by this subsection.

      "text": "945.6402 Inmate health care advance directives.— (1) DEFINITIONS.—The terms used in this section have the same meanings as in s. 765.101 unless otherwise specified in this section. For purposes of this section, the term: (a) “Health care facility” has the same meaning as in s. 765.101 and includes any correctional institution or facility where health care is provided. (b) “Incapacity” or “incompetent” means an inmate is physically or mentally unable to communicate a willful and knowing health care decision. (c) “Informed consent” means consent voluntarily given by an inmate after a sufficient explanation and disclosure of the subject matter involved to enable the inmate to have a general understanding of the treatment or procedure and the medically acceptable alternatives, including the substantial risks and hazards inherent in the proposed treatment or procedures, and to make a knowing health care decision without coercion or undue influence. (d) “Inmate” means any person committed to the custody of the department. (e) “Ombudsman” means an individual designated and specifically trained by the department to identify conditions that may pose a threat to the rights, health, safety, and welfare of inmates in a health care facility and who may be appointed to serve as a proxy for an inmate who is physically or mentally unable to communicate a willful and knowing health care decision. (f) “Proxy” means a competent adult who has not been expressly designated to make health care decisions for a particular incapacitated inmate, but who, nevertheless, is authorized pursuant to s. 765.401 and as specified in this section to make health care decisions for such inmate. (g) “Proxy review team” means a team of at least five members, appointed by the Assistant Secretary for Health Services. The team shall be composed of, at a minimum, one physician licensed pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459, one psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 490, one nurse licensed pursuant to chapter 464, and one department chaplain. (2) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.— (a) In accordance with chapter 765, the Legislature finds that an inmate retains the fundamental right of self-determination regarding decisions pertaining to his or her own health, including the right to choose or refuse medical treatment. In accordance with chapter 765, this right is subject to certain institutional interests including the protection of human life; the preservation of ethical standards in the medical profession; and, for inmates committed to the custody of the department, the security and good order of the institutional setting. (b) To ensure that such right is not lost or diminished by virtue of later physical or mental incapacity, the Legislature intends that the procedures specified in chapter 765, and as modified in this section for the institutional health care setting, apply to incarcerated inmates. These procedures should be less expensive and less restrictive than guardianship and allow an inmate to plan for incapacity by executing a document or orally designating another person to direct the course of his or her health care or receive his or her health information, or both, upon his or her incapacity. These procedures permit a previously incapacitated inmate to exercise his or her full right to make health care decisions as soon as the capacity to make such decisions has been regained. (c) In order to ensure that the rights and intentions of an inmate are respected when the inmate is not able to participate actively in decisions concerning himself or herself, and to encourage communication among such inmate, his or her family, and his or her treating physicians, the Legislature declares that the laws of this state recognize the right of a competent incarcerated adult to make an advance directive instructing his or her physicians to provide, withhold, or withdraw life-prolonging procedures or to designate another person to make the health care decision for him or her in the event that such incarcerated person should become incapacitated and unable to personally direct his or her health care. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the department provide the opportunity for inmates to make advance directives as specified in this section. (d) The Legislature further recognizes that incarcerated inmates may not avail themselves of the opportunity to make an advance directive or, because of incarceration, may not have a surrogate, as defined in s. 765.101, willing, able, or reasonably available to make health care decisions on his or her behalf. Additionally, because of incarceration, the individuals designated in s. 765.401 who are eligible to serve as an appointed proxy may not be reasonably available, willing, or competent to make health care decisions for the inmate in the event of incapacity. Thus, it is the intent of the Legislature that the department have an efficient process that is less expensive and less restrictive than guardianship for the appointment of a proxy to allow for the expedient delivery of necessary health care to an incarcerated inmate. (e) This section does not supersede the process for inmate involuntary mental health treatment in ss. 945.40-945.49. (3) CAPACITY OF INMATE; PROCEDURE.— (a) An inmate is presumed to be capable of making health care decisions for himself or herself unless he or she is determined to be incapacitated. When an inmate has decisionmaking capacity, the inmate’s wishes are controlling. Each physician or health care provider must clearly communicate the treatment plan and any change to the treatment plan before implementation of the plan or any change to the plan. Incapacity may not be inferred from an inmate’s involuntary hospitalization for mental illness or from his or her intellectual disability. (b) If an inmate’s capacity to make health care decisions for himself or herself or provide informed consent is in question, the inmate’s treating physician at the health care facility where the inmate is located shall evaluate the inmate’s capacity and, if the evaluating physician concludes that the inmate lacks capacity, enter that evaluation in the inmate’s medical record. If the evaluating physician has a question as to whether the inmate lacks capacity, another physician shall also evaluate the inmate’s capacity, and if the second physician finds that the inmate lacks the capacity to make health care decisions for himself or herself or provide informed consent, both physicians’ evaluations shall be entered in the inmate’s medical record. (c) If the inmate is found to be incapacitated and has designated a health care surrogate in accordance with chapter 765, the institution’s or facility’s health care staff shall notify the surrogate and proceed as specified in chapter 765. If the incapacitated inmate has not designated a health care surrogate, the health care facility shall appoint a proxy to make health care decisions for the inmate as specified in this section. (d) A determination made pursuant to this section that an inmate lacks the capacity to make health care decisions for himself or herself may not be construed as a finding that an inmate lacks capacity for any other purpose. (4) HEALTH CARE ADVANCE DIRECTIVE; PROCEDURE.— (a) In accordance with chapter 765, the department shall offer inmates the opportunity to execute an advance directive as defined in s. 765.101. (b) The department shall provide to each inmate written information concerning advance directives and necessary forms to allow inmates to execute an advance directive. The department and its health care providers shall document in the inmate’s medical records whether the inmate has executed an advance directive. Neither the department nor its health care providers may require an inmate to execute an advance directive using the department’s forms. The inmate’s advance directive shall travel with the inmate within the department as part of the inmate’s medical record. (c) An advance directive may be amended or revoked at any time by a competent inmate by means of: 1. A signed, dated writing of intent to amend or revoke; 2. The physical cancellation or destruction of the advance directive by the inmate or by another person in the inmate’s presence and at the inmate’s direction; 3. An oral expression of intent to amend or revoke; or 4. A subsequently executed advance directive that is materially different from a previously executed advance directive. (5) PROXY.— (a) If an incapacitated inmate has not executed an advance directive, or designated a health care surrogate in accordance with the procedures specified in chapter 765 or the designated health care surrogate is no longer available to make health care decisions, health care decisions may be made for the inmate by any of the individuals specified in the priority order provided in s. 765.401(1)(a)-(g) as proxy. Documentation of the efforts to locate a proxy from the classes specified in s. 765.401(1)(a)-(g) shall be recorded in the inmate’s medical file. (b) If there are no individuals as specified in s. 765.401(1)(a)-(g) available, willing, or competent to act on behalf of the inmate, and the inmate is housed in a correctional institution or facility where health care is provided in a nonhospital setting, the warden of the institution where the inmate is housed, or the warden’s designee, shall consult with the Assistant Secretary for Health Services or his or her designee who shall appoint a department ombudsman to serve as the proxy. This appointment terminates when the inmate regains capacity or is no longer incarcerated in the custody of the department. In accordance with chapter 765 and as provided in this section, decisions to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging procedures will be reviewed by the department’s proxy review team for compliance with chapter 765 and the requirements of this section. (c) The ombudsman appointed to serve as the proxy is authorized to request the assistance of the treating physician and, upon request, a second physician not involved in the inmate’s care to assist the proxy in evaluating the inmate’s treatment. (d) In accordance with chapter 765, any health care decision made by any appointed proxy under this section must be based on the proxy’s informed consent and on the decision that the proxy reasonably believes the inmate would have made under the circumstances. If there is no indication of what decision the inmate would have made, the proxy may consider the inmate’s best interest in deciding that proposed treatments are to be withheld or that treatments currently in effect are to be withdrawn. (e) Before exercising the incapacitated inmate’s rights to select or decline health care, the proxy must comply with ss. 765.205 and 765.305, except that any proxy’s decision to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging procedures must be supported by clear and convincing evidence that the decision would have been the one the inmate would have made had he or she been competent or, if there is no indication of what decision the inmate would have made, that the decision is in the inmate’s best interest. (f) Notwithstanding s. 456.057 and pursuant to s. 945.10 and 45 C.F.R. part 164, subpart E, relevant protected health information and mental health and medical records of an incapacitated inmate may be disclosed to a proxy appointed to make health care decisions for an inmate. (6) USE OF FORCE.—In addition to s. 944.35(1), an employee of the department may apply reasonable physical force upon an incapacitated inmate to administer medical treatment only by or under the clinical supervision of a physician or his or her designee and only to carry out a health care decision made in accordance with this section and chapter 765. (7) IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY.—A department health care provider, ombudsman, or other employee who acts under the direction of a health care provider as authorized in this section or chapter 765 is not subject to criminal prosecution or civil liability and may not be deemed to have engaged in unprofessional conduct as a result of carrying out a health care decision made in accordance with this section or chapter 765 on an inmate’s behalf.

(2) Only inmates eligible for control release pursuant to s. 947.146 shall be permitted to participate in the training program. (3) The inmate training program shall provide a short incarceration period of rigorous training to inmates who require a greater degree of supervision than is provided for those on community control or probation. The inmate training program is not intended to divert offenders away from probation or community control, but to divert them from long periods of incarceration when a short “shock” incarceration could produce the same deterrent effect. (4) Upon an inmate’s completion of the inmate training program, the department shall submit a report to the releasing authority that describes the inmate’s performance. If the performance has been satisfactory, the releasing authority shall establish a release date which is within 30 days following program completion. As a condition of release, the inmate shall be placed on community supervision as provided in chapter 947, and shall be subject to the conditions established therefor. (5) If an inmate in the training program becomes unmanageable, the department may place the inmate in the general inmate population to complete the remainder of his or her sentence.

The petition shall set forth with particularity the manner in which the department has failed to implement the decision of the Administration Commission, including any required remedial actions.
