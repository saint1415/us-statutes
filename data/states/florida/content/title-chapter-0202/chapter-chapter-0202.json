      "text": "202.105 Legislative findings and intent.— (1) It is declared to be a specific legislative finding that the creation of this chapter fulfills important state interests by reforming the tax laws to provide a fair, efficient, and uniform method for taxing communications services sold in this state. This chapter is essential to the continued economic vitality of this increasingly important industry because it restructures state and local taxes and fees to account for the impact of federal legislation, industry deregulation, and the multitude of providers offering functionally equivalent communications services in today’s marketplace. This chapter promotes the increased competition that accompanies deregulation by embracing a competitively neutral tax policy that will free consumers to choose a provider based on tax-neutral considerations. This chapter further spurs new competition by simplifying an extremely complicated state and local tax and fee system. Simplification will lower the cost of collecting taxes and fees, increase service availability, and place downward pressure on price. Newfound administrative efficiency is demonstrated by a reduction in the number of returns that a provider must file each month. By restructuring separate taxes and fees into a revenue-neutral communications services tax centrally administered by the department, this chapter will ensure that the growth of the industry is unimpaired by excessive governmental regulation. The tax imposed pursuant to this chapter is a replacement for taxes and fees previously imposed and is not a new tax. The taxes imposed and administered pursuant to this chapter are of general application and are imposed in a uniform, consistent, and nondiscriminatory manner. (2) It is declared to be a specific legislative finding that this chapter will not reduce the authority that municipalities or counties had to raise revenue in the aggregate, as such authority existed on February 1, 1989.

      "text": "202.12 Sales of communications services.—The Legislature finds that every person who engages in the business of selling communications services at retail in this state is exercising a taxable privilege. It is the intent of the Legislature that the tax imposed by chapter 203 be administered as provided in this chapter. (1) For the exercise of such privilege, a tax is levied on each taxable transaction and is due and payable as follows: (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, at the rate of 4.92 percent applied to the sales price of the communications service that: 1. Originates and terminates in this state, or 2. Originates or terminates in this state and is charged to a service address in this state, when sold at retail, computed on each taxable sale for the purpose of remitting the tax due. The gross receipts tax imposed by chapter 203 shall be collected on the same taxable transactions and remitted with the tax imposed by this paragraph. If no tax is imposed by this paragraph due to the exemption provided under s. 202.125(1), the tax imposed by chapter 203 shall nevertheless be collected and remitted in the manner and at the time prescribed for tax collections and remittances under this chapter. (b) At the rate of 9.07 percent applied to the retail sales price of any direct-to-home satellite service received in this state. The proceeds of the tax imposed under this paragraph shall be accounted for and distributed in accordance with s. 202.18(2). The gross receipts tax imposed by chapter 203 shall be collected on the same taxable transactions and remitted with the tax imposed by this paragraph. (c) At the rate set forth in paragraph (a) on the sales price of private communications services provided within this state, which shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: 1. Any charge with respect to a channel termination point located within this state; 2. Any charge for the use of a channel between two channel termination points located in this state; and 3. Where channel termination points are located both within and outside of this state: a. If any segment between two such channel termination points is separately billed, 50 percent of such charge; and b. If any segment of the circuit is not separately billed, an amount equal to the total charge for such circuit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points within this state and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points of the circuit. The gross receipts tax imposed by chapter 203 shall be collected on the same taxable transactions and remitted with the tax imposed by this paragraph. (d) At the rate set forth in paragraph (a) applied to the sales price of all mobile communications services deemed to be provided to a customer by a home service provider pursuant to s. 117(a) of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, Pub. L. No. 106-252, if such customer’s service address is located within this state. (2) A dealer of taxable communications services shall bill, collect, and remit the taxes on communications services imposed pursuant to chapter 203 and this section at a combined rate that is the sum of the rate of tax on communications services prescribed in chapter 203 and the applicable rate of tax prescribed in this section. However, a dealer shall, in reporting each remittance to the department, identify the portion thereof which consists of taxes remitted pursuant to chapter 203. Return forms prescribed by the department shall facilitate such reporting. (3) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the combined amount of taxes imposed under this section and s. 203.01(1)(a)2. shall not exceed $100,000 per calendar year on charges to any person for interstate communications services that originate outside this state and terminate within this state. This subsection applies only to holders of a direct-pay permit issued under this subsection. A refund may not be given for taxes paid before receiving a direct-pay permit. Upon application, the department may issue one direct-pay permit to the purchaser of communications services authorizing such purchaser to pay the Florida communications services tax on such services directly to the department if the majority of such services used by such person are for communications originating outside of this state and terminating in this state. Only one direct-pay permit shall be issued to a person. Such direct-pay permit shall identify the taxes and service addresses to which it applies. Any dealer of communications services furnishing communications services to the holder of a valid direct-pay permit is relieved of the obligation to collect and remit the taxes imposed under this section and s. 203.01(1)(a)2. on such services. Tax payments and returns pursuant to a direct-pay permit shall be monthly. As used in this subsection, “person” means a single legal entity and does not mean a group or combination of affiliated entities or entities controlled by one person or group of persons.

(b) The home service provider shall be held harmless from liability for any additional taxes imposed by or pursuant to this chapter or chapter 203 which are based on a different determination of such customer’s place of primary use. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3), a home service provider shall be allowed to treat the address used for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract in effect on August 1, 2002, as that customer’s place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement. (3)(a) The department shall provide notice to the customer of its intent to redetermine the customer’s place of primary use. If a final order is entered ruling that the address used by a home service provider as a customer’s place of primary use does not meet the definition of “place of primary use” provided by s. 202.11, the department shall notify the home service provider of the proper address to be used as such customer’s place of primary use. The home service provider shall begin using the correct address within 120 days. (b) The department shall provide notice to the home service provider of its intent to redetermine the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under s. 202.22. If a final order is entered ruling that the jurisdiction assigned by the home service provider is incorrect, the department shall notify the home service provider of the proper jurisdictional assignment.

(4)(a) If a mobile communications service is not subject to the taxes administered pursuant to this chapter, and if the sales price of such service is aggregated with and not separately stated from the sales price of services subject to tax, then the nontaxable mobile communications service shall be treated as being subject to tax unless the home service provider can reasonably identify the sales price of the service not subject to tax from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. (b) If a mobile communications service is not subject to the taxes administered pursuant to this chapter, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of such service unless the customer’s home service provider separately states the sales price of such nontaxable services or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider’s books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the sales price of such nontaxable service.

(2) A person may not engage in the business of providing communications services without first obtaining a certificate of registration. The failure or refusal to submit an application by any person required to register, as required by this section, is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. Any person who fails or refuses to register shall pay an initial registration fee of $100. However, this fee may be waived by the department if the failure is due to reasonable cause. (3)(a) An application for a certificate of registration must be completed by the dealer of communications services before engaging in business. The application for a certificate of registration must contain the information required by rule of the department. (b) The department, upon receipt of a completed application, shall grant to the applicant a certificate of registration. (4) Each application required by paragraph (3)(a) must set forth: (a) The name under which the person will transact business within this state. (b) The street address of his or her principal office or place of business within this state and of the location where records are available for inspection. (c) The name and complete residence address of the owner or the names and residence addresses of the partners, if the applicant is a partnership, or of the principal officers, if the applicant is a corporation or association. If the applicant is a corporation organized under the laws of another state, territory, or country, he or she must also file with the application a certified copy of the certificate or license issued by the Department of State showing that the corporation is authorized to transact business in this state. (d) Any other data required by the department. (5) Certificates of registration issued by the department are not assignable. (6) In addition to the certificate of registration, the department shall provide to each newly registered dealer an initial resale certificate that is valid for the remainder of the period of issuance. The department shall provide to each active dealer an annual resale certificate. As used in this section, the term “active dealer” means a person who is registered with the department and who is required to file a return at least once during each applicable reporting period. (7) A certificate of registration issued by the department may be revoked by the department or its designated agent when a dealer fails to comply with this chapter or chapter 203. Before revoking a dealer’s certificate of registration, the department must schedule an informal conference at which the dealer may present evidence regarding the department’s intended revocation or enter into a compliance agreement with the department. The department must notify the dealer of its intended action and of the time, place, and date of the scheduled informal conference by written notification sent by United States mail to the dealer’s last known address of record furnished by the dealer on a form prescribed by the department. The dealer must attend the informal conference and present evidence refuting the department’s intended revocation or enter into a compliance agreement with the department which resolves the dealer’s failure to comply with this chapter or chapter 203. The department shall issue an administrative complaint under s. 120.60 if the dealer fails to attend the department’s informal conference, fails to enter into a compliance agreement with the department resolving the dealer’s noncompliance with this chapter, or fails to comply with the executed compliance agreement. (8) It is the intent of the Legislature to subject to the provisions of this chapter all sellers of communications services that have established a sufficient connection with this state to permit the state constitutionally to require compliance with this chapter. Activities of a seller of communications services that may subject such a seller to the provisions of this chapter include, but are not limited to: (a) Maintaining an office or other place of business within this state. (b) Solicitation of business from one or more Florida locations through employees, agents, independent contractors, or other representatives of such seller.

      "text": "202.18 Allocation and disposition of tax proceeds.—The proceeds of the communications services taxes remitted under this chapter shall be treated as follows: (1) The proceeds of the taxes remitted under s. 202.12(1)(a) shall be divided as follows: (a) The portion of such proceeds which constitutes gross receipts taxes, imposed at the rate prescribed in chapter 203, shall be deposited as provided by law and in accordance with s. 9, Art. XII of the State Constitution. (b) The remaining portion shall be distributed according to s. 212.20(6). (2) The proceeds of the taxes remitted under s. 202.12(1)(b) shall be allocated as follows: (a) The portion of the proceeds which constitutes gross receipts taxes, imposed at the rate prescribed in chapter 203, shall be deposited as provided by law and in accordance with s. 9, Art. XII of the State Constitution. (b) Fifty-five and nine-tenths percent of the remainder shall be allocated to the state and distributed pursuant to s. 212.20(6), except that the proceeds allocated pursuant to s. 212.20(6)(d)2.b. shall be prorated to the participating counties in the same proportion as that month’s collection of the taxes and fees imposed pursuant to chapter 212 and paragraph (1)(b). (c)1. During each calendar year, the remaining portion of the proceeds shall be transferred to the Local Government Half-cent Sales Tax Clearing Trust Fund. Seventy percent of such proceeds shall be allocated in the same proportion as the allocation of total receipts of the half-cent sales tax under s. 218.61 and the emergency distribution under s. 218.65 in the prior state fiscal year. Thirty percent of such proceeds shall be distributed pursuant to s. 218.67. 2. The proportion of the proceeds allocated based on the emergency distribution under s. 218.65 shall be distributed pursuant to s. 218.65. 3. In each calendar year, the proportion of the proceeds allocated based on the half-cent sales tax under s. 218.61 shall be allocated to each county in the same proportion as the county’s percentage of total sales tax allocation for the prior state fiscal year and distributed pursuant to s. 218.62. 4. The department shall distribute the appropriate amount to each municipality and county each month at the same time that local communications services taxes are distributed pursuant to subsection (3). (3)(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the proceeds of each local communications services tax levied by a municipality or county pursuant to s. 202.19(1) or s. 202.20(1), less the department’s costs of administration, shall be transferred to the Local Communications Services Tax Clearing Trust Fund and held there to be distributed to such municipality or county. However, the proceeds of any communications services tax imposed pursuant to s. 202.19(5) shall be deposited and disbursed in accordance with ss. 212.054 and 212.055. For purposes of this section, the proceeds of any tax levied by a municipality, county, or school board under s. 202.19(1) or s. 202.20(1) are all funds collected and received by the department pursuant to a specific levy authorized by such sections, including any interest and penalties attributable to the tax levy. (b) The amount deducted for the costs of administration may not exceed 1 percent of the total revenue generated for all municipalities, counties, and school boards levying a tax pursuant to s. 202.19. The amount deducted for the costs of administration shall be used only for those costs that are attributable to the taxes imposed pursuant to s. 202.19. The total cost of administration shall be prorated among those jurisdictions levying the tax on the basis of the amount collected for a particular jurisdiction to the total amount collected for all such jurisdictions. (c)1. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, proceeds of the taxes levied pursuant to s. 202.19, less amounts deducted for costs of administration in accordance with paragraph (b), shall be distributed monthly to the appropriate jurisdictions. The proceeds of taxes imposed pursuant to s. 202.19(5) shall be distributed in the same manner as discretionary surtaxes are distributed, in accordance with ss. 212.054 and 212.055. 2. The department shall make any adjustments to the distributions pursuant to this section which are necessary to reflect the proper amounts due to individual jurisdictions or trust funds. In the event that the department adjusts amounts due to reflect a correction in the situsing of a customer, such adjustment shall be limited to the amount of tax actually collected from such customer by the dealer of communication services. 3.a. Adjustments in distributions which are necessary to correct misallocations between jurisdictions shall be governed by this subparagraph. If the department determines that misallocations between jurisdictions occurred, it shall provide written notice of such determination to all affected jurisdictions. The notice shall include the amount of the misallocations, the basis upon which the determination was made, data supporting the determination, and the identity of each affected jurisdiction. The notice shall also inform all affected jurisdictions of their authority to enter into a written agreement establishing a method of adjustment as described in sub-subparagraph c. b. An adjustment affecting a distribution to a jurisdiction which is less than 90 percent of the average monthly distribution to that jurisdiction for the 6 months immediately preceding the department’s determination, as reported by all communications services dealers, shall be made in the month immediately following the department’s determination that misallocations occurred. c. If an adjustment affecting a distribution to a jurisdiction equals or exceeds 90 percent of the average monthly distribution to that jurisdiction for the 6 months immediately preceding the department’s determination, as reported by all communications services dealers, the affected jurisdictions may enter into a written agreement establishing a method of adjustment. If the agreement establishing a method of adjustment provides for payments of local communications services tax monthly distributions, the amount of any such payment agreed to may not exceed the local communications services tax monthly distributions available to the jurisdiction that was allocated amounts in excess of those to which it was entitled. If affected jurisdictions execute a written agreement specifying a method of adjustment, a copy of the written agreement shall be provided to the department no later than the first day of the month following 90 days after the date the department transmits notice of the misallocation. If the department does not receive a copy of the written agreement within the specified time period, an adjustment affecting a distribution to a jurisdiction made pursuant to this sub-subparagraph shall be prorated over a time period that equals the time period over which the misallocations occurred.

      "text": "202.19 Authorization to impose local communications services tax.— (1) The governing authority of each county and municipality may, by ordinance, levy a local communications services tax as provided in this section. (2)(a) Charter counties and municipalities may levy the tax authorized by subsection (1) at a rate of up to 5.1 percent for municipalities and charter counties that have not chosen to levy permit fees, and at a rate of up to 4.98 percent for municipalities and charter counties that have chosen to levy permit fees. (b) Noncharter counties may levy the tax authorized by subsection (1) at a rate of up to 1.6 percent. (c) The maximum rates authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) do not include the add-ons of up to 0.12 percent for municipalities and charter counties or of up to 0.24 percent for noncharter counties authorized pursuant to s. 337.401, nor do they supersede conversion or emergency rates authorized by s. 202.20 which are in excess of these maximum rates. (d) The local communications services tax rate in effect on January 1, 2023, may not be increased before January 1, 2031. (3)(a) The tax authorized under this section includes and is in lieu of any fee or other consideration, including, but not limited to, application fees, transfer fees, renewal fees, or claims for related costs, to which the municipality or county is otherwise entitled for granting permission to dealers of communications services, including, but not limited to, providers of cable television services, as authorized in 47 U.S.C. s. 542, to use or occupy its roads or rights-of-way for the placement, construction, and maintenance of poles, wires, and other fixtures used in the provision of communications services. (b) This subsection does not supersede or impair the right, if any, of a municipality or county to require the payment of consideration or to require the payment of regulatory fees or assessments by persons using or occupying its roads or rights-of-way in a capacity other than that of a dealer of communications services. (c) Each county and municipality must prioritize the use of proceeds distributed pursuant to s. 202.18(3)(c) on the timely review, processing, and approval of permit applications for the use of rights-of-way by communications services providers to ensure that the county or municipality complies with state and federal law, including, but not limited to, the timelines under s. 337.401(7)(d). (4)(a)1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax imposed by any municipality shall be on all communications services subject to tax under s. 202.12 which: a. Originate or terminate in this state; and b. Are charged to a service address in the municipality. 2. With respect to private communications services, the tax shall be on the sales price of such services provided within the municipality, which shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: a. Any charge with respect to a channel termination point located within such municipality; b. Any charge for the use of a channel between two channel termination points located in such municipality; and c. Where channel termination points are located both within and outside of the municipality: (I) If any segment between two such channel termination points is separately billed, 50 percent of such charge; and (II) If any segment of the circuit is not separately billed, an amount equal to the total charge for such circuit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points within such municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points of the circuit. (b)1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax imposed by any county under subsection (1) shall be on all communications services subject to tax under s. 202.12 which: a. Originate or terminate in this state; and b. Are charged to a service address in the unincorporated area of the county. 2. With respect to private communications services, the tax shall be on the sales price of such services provided within the unincorporated area of the county, which shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: a. Any charge with respect to a channel termination point located within the unincorporated area of such county; b. Any charge for the use of a channel between two channel termination points located in the unincorporated area of such county; and c. Where channel termination points are located both within and outside of the unincorporated area of such county: (I) If any segment between two such channel termination points is separately billed, 50 percent of such charge; and (II) If any segment of the circuit is not separately billed, an amount equal to the total charge for such circuit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points within the unincorporated area of such county and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points of the circuit. (5) In addition to the communications services taxes authorized by subsection (1), a discretionary sales surtax that a county or school board has levied under s. 212.055 is imposed as a local communications services tax under this section, and the rate shall be determined in accordance with s. 202.20(3). However, any increase to the discretionary sales surtax levied under s. 212.055 on or after January 1, 2023, may not be added to the local communications services tax under this section before January 1, 2031. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, each such tax rate shall be applied, in addition to the other tax rates applied under this chapter, to communications services subject to tax under s. 202.12 which: 1. Originate or terminate in this state; and 2. Are charged to a service address in the county. (b) With respect to private communications services, the tax shall be on the sales price of such services provided within the county, which shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: 1. Any charge with respect to a channel termination point located within such county; 2. Any charge for the use of a channel between two channel termination points located in such county; and 3. Where channel termination points are located both within and outside of such county: a. If any segment between two such channel termination points is separately billed, 50 percent of such charge; and b. If any segment of the circuit is not separately billed, an amount equal to the total charge for such circuit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points within such county and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points of the circuit. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a tax imposed under this section does not apply to any direct-to-home satellite service. (7) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a tax imposed under this section shall not exceed $25,000 per calendar year on communications services charges billed to a service address located in a municipality or county imposing a local communications services tax for interstate communications services that originate outside this state and terminate within this state. This subsection applies only to holders of a direct-pay permit issued under s. 202.12(3). A person who does not qualify for a direct-pay permit under s. 202.12(3) does not qualify for a direct-pay permit under this subsection. A refund may not be given for taxes paid before receiving a direct-pay permit. Upon application, the department shall identify the service addresses qualifying for the limitation provided by this subsection on the direct-pay permit issued under s. 202.12(3) and authorize such purchaser to pay the local communications tax on such interstate services directly to the department if the application indicates that the majority of such services used by such person and billed to a service address are for communications originating outside of this state and terminating in this state. The direct-pay permit shall also indicate the counties or municipalities to which it applies. Any dealer of communications services furnishing communications services to the holder of a valid direct-pay permit is relieved of the obligation to collect and remit the tax on such services. Tax payments and returns pursuant to a direct-pay permit shall be monthly. As used in this subsection, “person” means a single legal entity and does not mean a group or combination of affiliated entities or entities controlled by one person or group of persons. (8) The revenues raised by any tax imposed under subsection (1) or s. 202.20(1), or distributed to a local government pursuant to s. 202.18, may be used by a municipality or county for any public purpose, including, but not limited to, pledging such revenues for the repayment of current or future bonded indebtedness. Revenues raised by a tax imposed under subsection (5) shall be used for the same purposes as the underlying discretionary sales surtax imposed by the county or school board under s. 212.055. (9) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the exemption set forth in s. 202.125(1) shall not apply to a tax imposed by a municipality, school board, or county pursuant to subsection (4) or subsection (5). (10) To the extent that a provider of communications services is required to pay to a local taxing jurisdiction a tax, charge, or other fee under any franchise agreement or ordinance with respect to the services or revenues that are also subject to the tax imposed by this section, such provider is entitled to a credit against the amount payable to the state pursuant to this section in the amount of such tax, charge, or fee with respect to such services or revenues. The amount of such credit shall be deducted from the amount that such local taxing jurisdiction is entitled to receive under s. 202.18(3). (11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, with respect to mobile communications services, the rate of a local communications services tax levied under this section shall be applied to the sales price of all mobile communications services deemed to be provided to a customer by a home service provider pursuant to s. 117(a) of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, Pub. L. No. 106-252, if such customer’s service address is located within the municipality levying the tax or within the unincorporated area of the county levying the tax, as the case may be.

If complete data are not available at the time of determining whether the revenues received by a local government from the local communications services tax imposed under subsection (1) are less than the revenues received from the replaced revenue sources for the corresponding 2000-2001 period, as set forth in subparagraph 1., the local government shall use the best data available for the corresponding 2000-2001 period in making such determination. Complete data shall be deemed available to all local governments after the department audits, including the redistribution of local tax, dealers who account for no less than 80 percent of the amount of communications services tax revenues received for fiscal year 2005-2006. 3. The adjustment permitted under subparagraph 1. may be made by emergency ordinance or resolution and may be made notwithstanding the maximum rate established under s. 202.19(2) and notwithstanding any schedules or timeframes or any other limitations contained in this chapter. Beginning July 1, 2007, a local government may make such adjustment only if the department or a dealer allocates or reallocates revenues away from the local government. However, any such adjustment shall be made no later than 6 months following the date the department notifies the local governments in writing that complete data is available. The emergency ordinance or resolution shall specify an effective date for the adjusted rate, which shall be no less than 60 days after the date of adoption of the ordinance or resolution and shall be effective with respect to taxable services included on bills that are dated on the first day of a month subsequent to the expiration of the 60-day period. At the end of 1 year following the effective date of such adjusted rate, the local governing authority shall, as soon as is consistent with s. 202.21, reduce the rate by that portion of the emergency rate which was necessary to recoup the amount of revenues not received prior to the implementation of the emergency rate. 4. If, for the period October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002, the revenues received by a local government from the local communications services tax conversion rate established under subsection (1), adjusted upward for the difference in rates between paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) or any other rate adjustments or base changes, are above the threshold of 10 percent more than the revenues received from the replaced revenue sources for the corresponding 2000-2001 period plus reasonably anticipated growth in such revenues over the preceding 1-year period, based on the average growth of such revenues over the immediately preceding 5-year period, the governing authority must adjust the rate of the local communications services tax to the extent necessary to reduce revenues to the threshold by emergency ordinance or resolution within the timeframes established in subparagraph 3. The foregoing rate adjustment requirement shall not apply to a local government that adopts a local communications services tax rate by resolution or ordinance. If complete data are not available at the time of determining whether the revenues exceed the threshold, the local government shall use the best data available for the corresponding 2000-2001 period in making such determination. This subparagraph shall not be construed as establishing a right of action for any person to enforce this subparagraph or challenge a local government’s implementation of this subparagraph. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, “replaced revenue sources,” as used in this section, means the following taxes, charges, fees, or other impositions to the extent that the respective local taxing jurisdictions were authorized to impose them prior to July 1, 2000. 1. With respect to municipalities and charter counties and the taxes authorized by s. 202.19(1): a. The public service tax on telecommunications authorized by former s. 166.231(9). b. Franchise fees on cable service providers as authorized by 47 U.S.C. s. 542. c. The public service tax on prepaid calling arrangements. d. Franchise fees on dealers of communications services which use the public roads or rights-of-way, up to the limit set forth in s. 337.401. For purposes of calculating rates under this section, it is the legislative intent that charter counties be treated as having had the same authority as municipalities to impose franchise fees on recurring local telecommunication service revenues prior to July 1, 2000. However, the Legislature recognizes that the authority of charter counties to impose such fees is in dispute, and the treatment provided in this section is not an expression of legislative intent that charter counties actually do or do not possess such authority. e. Actual permit fees relating to placing or maintaining facilities in or on public roads or rights-of-way, collected from providers of long-distance, cable, and mobile communications services for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999; however, if a municipality or charter county elects the option to charge permit fees pursuant to s. 337.401(3)(c), such fees shall not be included as a replaced revenue source. 2. With respect to all other counties and the taxes authorized in s. 202.19(1), franchise fees on cable service providers as authorized by 47 U.S.C. s. 542. (3) For any county or school board that levies a discretionary surtax under s. 212.055, the rate of such tax on communications services as authorized by s. 202.19(5) shall be as follows: County .5% Discretionary surtax conversion rates 1% Discretionary surtax conversion rates 1.5% Discretionary surtax conversion rates Alachua 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Baker 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Bay 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Bradford 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Brevard 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Broward 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Calhoun 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Charlotte 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Citrus 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Clay 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Collier 0.4% 0.7% 1.0% Columbia 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Desoto 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Dixie 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Duval 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Escambia 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Flagler 0.4% 0.7% 1.0% Franklin 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Gadsden 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Gilchrist 0.3% 0.5% 0.7% Glades 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Gulf 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Hamilton 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Hardee 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Hendry 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Hernando 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Highlands 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Hillsborough 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Holmes 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Indian River 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Jackson 0.3% 0.5% 0.7% Jefferson 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Lafayette 0.3% 0.5% 0.7% Lake 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Lee 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Leon 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Levy 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Liberty 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Madison 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Manatee 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Marion 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Martin 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Miami-Dade 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Monroe 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Nassau 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Okaloosa 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Okeechobee 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Orange 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Osceola 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Palm Beach 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Pasco 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Pinellas 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Polk 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Putnam 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% St. Johns 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% St. Lucie 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Santa Rosa 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Sarasota 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Seminole 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Sumter 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Suwannee 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Taylor 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Union 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% Volusia 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% Wakulla 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Walton 0.3% 0.6% 0.9% Washington 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% The discretionary surtax conversion rate with respect to communications services reflected on bills dated on or after October 1, 2001, shall take effect without any further action by a county or school board that has levied a surtax on or before October 1, 2001. For a county or school board that levies a surtax subsequent to October 1, 2001, the discretionary surtax conversion rate with respect to communications services shall take effect upon the effective date of the surtax as provided in s. 212.054. The discretionary sales surtax rate on communications services for a county or school board levying a combined rate which is not listed in the table provided by this subsection shall be calculated by averaging or adding the appropriate rates from the table and rounding up to the nearest tenth of a percent.

      "text": "202.22 Determination of local tax situs.— (1) A dealer of communications services who is obligated to collect and remit a local communications services tax imposed under s. 202.19 shall be held harmless from any liability, including tax, interest, and penalties, which would otherwise be due solely as a result of an assignment of a service address to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction, if the dealer of communications services exercises due diligence in applying one or more of the following methods for determining the local taxing jurisdiction in which a service address is located: (a) Employing an electronic database provided by the department under subsection (2). (b) Employing a database developed by the dealer or supplied by a vendor which has been certified by the department under subsection (3). (c)1. Employing enhanced zip codes to assign each street address, address range, post office box, or post office box range in the dealer’s service area to a specific local taxing jurisdiction. 2. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of municipalities or counties, or if an enhanced zip code cannot be assigned to the service address because the service address is in a rural area or a location without postal delivery, the dealer of communications services or its database vendor shall assign the affected service addresses to one specific local taxing jurisdiction within such zip code based on a reasonable methodology. A methodology satisfies this subparagraph if the information used to assign service addresses is obtained by the dealer or its database vendor from: a. A database provided by the department; b. A database certified by the department under subsection (3); c. Responsible representatives of the relevant local taxing jurisdictions; or d. The United States Census Bureau or the United States Postal Service. (d) Employing a database of street addresses or other assignments that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(c), but meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (3)(a) at the time of audit by the department. (2)(a) The department shall, subject to legislative appropriation, create as soon as practical and feasible, and thereafter maintain, an electronic database that gives due and proper regard to any format that is approved by the American National Standards Institute’s Accredited Standards Committee X12 and that designates for each street address, address range, post office box, or post office box range in the state, including any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the local taxing jurisdiction in which the street address, address range, post office box, or post office box range is located and the appropriate code for each such local taxing jurisdiction, identified by one nationwide standard numeric code. The nationwide standard numeric code must contain the same number of numeric digits, and each digit, or combination of digits, must refer to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States using a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission. Each address or address range or post office box or post office box range must be provided in standard postal format, including the street number, street number range, street name, post office box number, post office box range, and zip code. The department shall provide notice of the availability of the database, and any subsequent revision thereof, by publication in the Florida Administrative Register. (b)1. Each local taxing jurisdiction shall furnish to the department all information needed to create and update the electronic database, including changes in service addresses, annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries. The information furnished to the department must specify an effective date, which must be the next ensuing January 1 or July 1, and such information must be furnished to the department at least 120 days prior to the effective date. However, the requirement that counties submit information pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to appropriation. 2. The department shall update the electronic database in accordance with the information furnished by local taxing jurisdictions under subparagraph 1. Each update must specify the effective date as the next ensuing January 1 or July 1 and must be posted by the department on a website not less than 90 days prior to the effective date. A substantially affected person may provide notice to the database administrator of an objection to information contained in the electronic database. If an objection is supported by competent evidence, the department shall forward the evidence to the affected local taxing jurisdictions and update the electronic database in accordance with the determination furnished by local taxing jurisdictions to the department. The department shall also furnish the update on magnetic or electronic media to any dealer of communications services or vendor who requests the update on such media. However, the department may collect a fee from the dealer of communications services which does not exceed the actual cost of furnishing the update on magnetic or electronic media. Information contained in the electronic database is conclusive for purposes of this chapter. The electronic database is not an order, a rule, or a policy of general applicability. 3. Each update must identify the additions, deletions, and other changes to the preceding version of the database. (3) For purposes of this section, a database must be certified by the department pursuant to rules that implement the following criteria and procedures: (a) The database must assign street addresses, address ranges, post office boxes, or post office box ranges to the proper jurisdiction with an overall accuracy rate of 95 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence, as determined through a statistically reliable sample. The accuracy must be measured based on the entire geographic area within the state covered by such database. (b) Upon receipt of an application for certification or recertification of a database, the provisions of s. 120.60 shall apply, except that the department shall examine the application and, within 90 days after receipt, notify the applicant of any apparent errors or omissions and request any additional information determined necessary. The applicant shall designate an individual responsible for providing access to all records, facilities, and processes the department determines are reasonably necessary to review, inspect, or test to make a determination regarding the application. Such access must be provided within 10 working days after notification. (c) The application must be in the form prescribed by rule and must include the applicant’s name, federal employer identification number, mailing address, business address, and any other information required by the department. The application may request that the applicant identify the applicant’s proposal for testing the database. (d) Each application for certification must be approved or denied upon written notice within 180 days after receipt of a completed application. The notice must specify the grounds for denial, inform the applicant of any remedy that is available, and indicate the procedure that must be followed. Filing of a petition under chapter 120 does not preclude the department from certifying the database upon a demonstration that the deficiencies have been corrected. (e) Certification or recertification of a database under this subsection is effective from the date of the department’s notice approving the application until the expiration of 3 or 4 years following such date, as set forth in the notice, except as provided in paragraph (f). (f) An application for recertification of a database must be received by the department not more than 3 years after the date of any prior certification. The application and procedures relating thereto shall be governed by this subsection, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. When an application for recertification has been timely submitted, the existing certification shall not expire but shall remain effective until the application has received final action by the department, or if the application is denied, until the denial is no longer subject to administrative or judicial review or such later date as may be fixed by order of the reviewing court. (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a dealer submits an application for certification on or before the later of October 1, 2001, or the date that is 30 days after the date on which the applicable department rule becomes effective, the 180-day time limit set forth in paragraph (d) does not apply. During the time the application is under consideration by the department or, if the application is denied, until the denial is no longer subject to administrative or judicial review or until a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court: 1. For purposes of computing the amount of the deduction to which such dealer is entitled under s. 202.28, the dealer shall be deemed to have used a certified database pursuant to paragraph (1)(b). 2. In the event that such application is approved, such approval shall be deemed to have been effective on the date of the application or October 1, 2001, whichever is later. (4)(a) As used in this section, “due diligence” means the care and attention that is expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent person under the circumstances. (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a dealer of communications services is exercising due diligence in applying one or more of the methods set forth in subsection (1) if the dealer: 1. Expends reasonable resources to accurately and reliably implement such method. However, the employment of enhanced zip codes pursuant to paragraph (1)(c) satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph; and 2. Maintains adequate internal controls in assigning street addresses, address ranges, post offices boxes, and post office box ranges to taxing jurisdictions. Internal controls are adequate if the dealer of communications services: a. Maintains and follows procedures to obtain and implement periodic and consistent updates to the database at least once every 6 months; and b. Corrects errors in the assignments of service addresses to local taxing jurisdictions within 120 days after the dealer discovers such errors. (5) If a dealer of communications services does not use one or more of the methods specified in subsection (1) for determining the local taxing jurisdiction in which one or more service addresses are located and: (a) The dealer’s failure to use one or more of such methods results in a net aggregate underpayment of all taxes levied pursuant to s. 202.19 with respect to one or more tax periods that are being examined by the department under the provisions of this chapter; and (b) The department has determined the misallocations between jurisdictions for all taxes levied pursuant to s. 202.19 and collected by the dealer with respect to any tax period being examined by the department; then, the dealer of communications services may be held liable to the department for the net aggregate underpayment of tax, and for interest and penalties attributable to the net aggregate underpayment of tax, which is due as a result of assigning one or more service addresses to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8) and ss. 202.34 and 202.35(3), the dealer of communications services is not liable for any tax, interest, or penalty under this subsection unless the department has determined the net aggregate underpayment of tax for any tax period that is being examined, taking into account all underpayments and overpayments for such period or periods. (6)(a) Pursuant to rules adopted by the department, each dealer of communications services must notify the department of the methods it intends to employ for determining the local taxing jurisdiction in which service addresses are located. (b) Notwithstanding s. 202.28, if a dealer of communications services: 1. Employs a method of assigning service addresses other than as set forth in paragraph (1)(a), paragraph (1)(b), or paragraph (1)(c), the deduction allowed to the dealer of communications services as compensation under s. 202.28 shall be 0.25 percent of that portion of the tax due and accounted for and remitted to the department which is attributable to such method of assigning service addresses other than as set forth in paragraph (1)(a), paragraph (1)(b), or paragraph (1)(c). 2. Employs a method of assigning service addresses as set forth in paragraph (1)(a), paragraph (1)(b), or paragraph (1)(c), the department may not deny the deduction allowed to the dealer of communications services as compensation allowed under s. 202.28 because the dealer assigned one or more service addresses to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction. (7) As used in this section, “enhanced zip code” means a United States postal zip code of 9 or more digits. (8) All local communications services taxes collected by a dealer are subject to the provisions of s. 213.756. The hold harmless protection provided by subsection (1) does not entitle a dealer to retain or take credits for taxes collected from any customers that are assigned to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction in excess of the taxes due to the correct local taxing jurisdiction for that customer. Dealers are entitled to refunds of or credits for such excess collections only upon making refunds or providing credits to the customer.

      "text": "202.27 Return filing; rules for self-accrual.— (1) For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax payable under this chapter and chapter 203, each dealer must file a return and remit the taxes required to be collected in any calendar month to the department, on or before the 20th day of the subsequent month, upon forms prepared and furnished by the department or in a format prescribed by it. The department shall, by rule, prescribe the information to be furnished by taxpayers on such returns. For the purpose of determining the taxes required to be remitted under this subsection, a dealer may elect to use an alternative-period basis. As used in this subsection, the term “alternative-period basis” means any month-long period, other than a calendar month, with an end date on or after the 15th day of the calendar month. The election shall be made on forms prepared and furnished by the department or in a format prescribed by the department. A dealer making such election is bound by the election for at least 12 months. If an election is made, the dealer must file a return and remit the taxes required to be collected in the chosen alternative-period basis to the department on or before the 20th day of the subsequent month. (2) The department may require: (a) A quarterly return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $1,000. (b) A semiannual return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $500. (c) An annual return and payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed $100. (d) A quarterly return and monthly payment when the tax remitted by the dealer for the preceding four calendar quarters exceeded $1,000 but did not exceed $12,000. (3) The department shall accept returns, except those required to be initiated through an electronic data interchange, as timely if postmarked on or before the 20th day of the month; if the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state legal holiday, returns are timely if postmarked on the next succeeding workday. Each dealer shall file a return for each tax period even though no tax is due for such period. (4) Whenever returns are required to be made to the department, the full amount of the taxes required to be paid as shown by the return must be paid and accompany the return, and the failure to remit the full amount of taxes at the time of making the return shall cause the taxes to become delinquent. All taxes and all interest and penalties imposed or administered under this chapter must be remitted to the department at Tallahassee or at another office designated by the department, in the form required by the department. (5) The department may require all returns of taxes under this chapter to be accompanied by a written statement, by the person or by an officer of any firm or corporation required to pay such taxes, setting forth the facts that the department requires in order to ascertain the amount of taxes that are due and payable with the return. The filing of a return that is not accompanied by payment is prima facie evidence of the wrongful conversion of the money due. Any person or any duly authorized corporation officer or agent, or members of any firm or incorporated society or organization, who refuses to make a return and pay the taxes due, as required by the department and in the manner and in the form that the department requires, or to state in writing that the return is correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, as required by the department, is subject to a penalty of 6 percent per annum of the amount due and commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. The signing of a written return has the same legal effect as if made under oath without the necessity of appending an oath thereto. (6) In addition to the contact person identified on the return, each dealer of communications services obligated to collect and remit local communications services tax imposed under s. 202.19 may at any time, and shall within 10 days after a request, designate a managerial representative to whom the department shall direct any inquiry regarding the completeness or accuracy of the dealer’s return when the response provided by the contact person identified on the return has been inadequate. When the representative designated under this subsection is contacted by the department, the dealer shall respond to the department within 30 days. (7) The department may provide by rule for self-accrual of the communications services tax when: (a) Authorized by law for holders of direct-pay permits; or (b) The taxable status of sales of communications services will be known only upon use.

(a) The collection allowance may not be granted, nor may any deduction be permitted, if the required tax return or tax is delinquent at the time of payment. (b) The department may deny the collection allowance if a taxpayer files an incomplete return. 1. For the purposes of this chapter, a return is incomplete if it is lacking such uniformity, completeness, and arrangement that the physical handling, verification, review of the return, or determination of other taxes and fees reported on the return can not be readily accomplished. 2. The department shall adopt rules requiring the information that it considers necessary to ensure that the taxes levied or administered under this chapter are properly collected, reviewed, compiled, reported, and enforced, including, but not limited to, rules requiring the reporting of the amount of gross sales; the amount of taxable sales; the amount of tax collected or due; the amount of lawful refunds, deductions, or credits claimed; the amount claimed as the dealer’s collection allowance; the amount of penalty and interest; and the amount due with the return. (c) The collection allowance and other credits or deductions provided in this chapter shall be applied to the taxes reported for the jurisdiction previously credited with the tax paid. (d) A disallowance of a collection allowance based on a delinquent tax payment is limited to the percentage of the total tax due which was delinquent when the payment was remitted to the department. The taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate the percentage of the payment which is not delinquent if that percentage is not readily evident at the time of payment. (2)(a) Any person who is required to make a return or pay the taxes imposed by this chapter who fails to timely file such return or fails to pay the taxes due within the time required, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, is subject to a specific penalty in the amount of 10 percent of any unpaid tax if the failure is for not more than 30 days, and an additional 10 percent of any unpaid tax for each additional 30 days, or fraction thereof, during which the failure continues, not to exceed a total penalty of 50 percent, in the aggregate, of any unpaid tax. (b) Any person who knowingly and with a willful intent to evade any tax imposed under this chapter fails to file six consecutive returns as required by law commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (c) Any person who makes a false or fraudulent return with a willful intent to evade payment of any tax or fee imposed under this chapter is liable, in addition to the other penalties provided by law, for a specific penalty of 100 percent of the tax bill or fee, and: 1. If the total amount of unreported taxes or fees is less than $300: a. Such person commits, for the first offense, a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. b. Such person commits, for the second offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. c. Such person commits, for the third and subsequent offenses, a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 2. If the total amount of unreported taxes or fees is $300 or more but less than $20,000, such person commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 3. If the total amount of unreported taxes or fees is $20,000 or more but less than $100,000, such person commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. 4. If the total amount of unreported taxes or fees is $100,000 or more, such person commits a felony of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (d) If a dealer fails to separately report and identify local communications services taxes on the appropriate return schedule, the dealer shall be subject to a penalty of $5,000 per return. If the department is unable to obtain appropriate return schedules, any penalty imposed by this paragraph shall be allocated in the same manner as provided in s. 202.18(2). (e) If a dealer of communications services does not use one or more of the methods specified in s. 202.22(1) for assigning service addresses to local jurisdictions and assigns one or more service addresses to an incorrect local jurisdiction in collecting and remitting local communications services taxes imposed under s. 202.19, the dealer shall be subject to a specific penalty of 10 percent of any tax collected but reported to the incorrect jurisdiction as a result of incorrect assignment, except that the penalty imposed under this paragraph with respect to a single return may not exceed $10,000.

(2) If any accounts for which a credit or refund has been received are then in whole or in part paid to the dealer, the amount paid must be included in the first return filed after such receipt and the tax paid accordingly. (3) Bad debts associated with accounts receivable which have been assigned or sold with recourse are eligible upon reassignment for inclusion by the dealer in the credit or refund authorized by this section. (4)(a) A dealer may report the credit for bad debt allowed under this section by netting such credit against the tax due to the state pursuant to s. 202.12 or to a local jurisdiction pursuant to s. 202.19, but such netting may not reduce the amount due to the state or to any local jurisdiction below zero. (b) For purposes of determining the amount of bad debt that is attributable to the state or to a local jurisdiction, a dealer may employ a proportionate allocation method based on current gross taxes due or another reasonable allocation method approved by the department.
