(2) Upon such payment, the clerk shall execute and record in the official records a satisfaction of judgment upon payment of the recording charge prescribed in s. 28.24(13). Upon payment of the amount required in subsection (1) and the recording charge required by this subsection and execution and recordation of the satisfaction by the clerk, any lien created by the judgment is satisfied and discharged. (3) The satisfaction of judgment executed by the clerk must be substantially in the following form: Satisfaction of Judgment by Clerk The undersigned Clerk acknowledges on this day of (month) , (year) , receipt from (identity of party making payment) of $ (total amount received) , comprised of $ face amount of the judgment; $ interest accruing on the judgment through the date of payment; $ costs of issuance of any execution; and $ for recording.

Upon the execution of this satisfaction, said judgment is satisfied and discharged. If an address for the judgment holder was provided under section 55.10(1), Florida Statutes, I certify that a copy of this notice has been sent to the judgment holder at said address by certified mail with return receipt requested or by registered mail if the notice is to be sent outside the continental United States. Clerk of Court (4) If an address for the judgment holder was provided under s. 55.10(1), the clerk shall formally send a copy of the satisfaction to the judgment holder at that address by certified mail with return receipt or by registered mail if the notice is to be sent outside the continental United States. If an address is not provided under s. 55.10(1) or if delivery cannot be effected to such address, the clerk may, but is not obligated to, make reasonable attempts to locate the judgment holder. The discharge of the lien by the issuance of the satisfaction is not dependent upon the delivery of notice by the clerk. (5) Upon application of the judgment holder, the clerk shall pay over to the judgment holder the full amount of the payment received, less the clerk’s fees for issuing execution on such judgment, if any has been issued; less the clerk’s fees for receiving into and paying out of the registry of the court such payment; less the clerk’s fees for recording the satisfaction of judgment; and, if the clerk incurred expenses in locating the judgment holder, less the reasonable expenses so incurred.

Such judgment creditor proceeding by writ of execution acquires a lien as of the time of levy and only on the property levied upon. (2) A buyer in the ordinary course of business as defined in s. 671.201(9) takes free of a judgment lien acquired as provided in s. 55.202 or s. 55.204 even though the buyer knows of its existence. A valid security interest as defined in chapter 679 in after-acquired property of the judgment debtor which is perfected before the debtor acquires an interest in the property takes priority over the judgment lien on the after-acquired property. (3) An individual buyer of goods for personal, family, or household use who buys the goods from a seller who held the goods for personal, family, or household use, and who pays value without knowledge that the goods are subject to a judgment lien, is entitled, to the extent of the value paid, to a lien on the goods superior to the judgment lien. If the buyer has made improvements to the goods, or other reasons justify doing so, a court may adjust the amount secured by the lien as the equities may require. This subsection shall not apply to: (a) A transfer to a relative or an insider of the judgment debtor, as such are defined at s. 726.102; (b) A fraudulent transfer, as defined by s. 726.105, s. 726.106, or 11 U.S.C. s. 548; (c) A fraudulent asset conversion as defined by s. 222.30; (d) Twenty-five percent of the transfer of goods by a judgment debtor the value of which, in the aggregate, exceeds $10,000; (e) Fifty percent of the transfer of goods by a judgment debtor the value of which, in the aggregate, exceeds $20,000; (f) Seventy-five percent of the transfer of goods by a judgment debtor the value of which, in the aggregate, exceeds $25,000; or (g) Any transfer of goods by a judgment debtor the value of which, in the aggregate, exceeds $30,000. (4) A buyer of stock in a corporation takes free of a judgment lien hereunder if the buyer pays value in good faith without notice as defined in s. 678.1051. (5)(a) If the judgment debtor’s personal property, to the extent not exempt from execution, includes a motor vehicle or a vessel for which a Florida certificate of title has been issued, a judgment lien acquired under this section on such property not yet noted on the certificate of title is valid and enforceable against the judgment debtor. However, enforceability under this chapter of such judgment lien against creditors or subsequent purchasers is determined as provided under s. 319.27(2), s. 328.14, or chapter 679, as applicable. (b) A judgment lienholder may obtain an order instructing the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to note the lien on the certificate of title through a court of competent jurisdiction conducting proceedings supplementary to execution under s. 56.29(6)(b). (6) A judgment lien acquired under s. 55.202 may be enforced only through judicial process, including attachment under chapter 76; execution under chapter 56; garnishment under chapter 77; a charging order under s. 605.0503, s. 620.1703, or s. 620.8504; or proceedings supplementary to execution under s. 56.29. A holder of a judgment lien acquired under s. 55.202, who is not enforcing separate lien rights in a judgment debtor’s property, may not enforce his or her rights under this section through self-help repossession or replevin without a court order or without the express consent of the judgment debtor contained in a record authenticated in accordance with s. 668.50 or s. 679.1021(1) after the judgment lien attaches. (7) Notwithstanding the attachment of a judgment lien acquired under s. 55.202 to payment intangibles or accounts and the proceeds thereof, the account debtor may, absent receipt of notice under s. 679.607(1)(a) from a secured party, discharge the account debtor’s obligation to pay payment intangibles or accounts or the proceeds thereof by paying the judgment debtor until, but not after, the account debtor is served by process with a complaint or petition by the judgment creditor seeking judicial relief with respect to the payment intangibles or accounts. Thereafter, the account debtor may discharge the account debtor’s obligation to pay payment intangibles or accounts or the proceeds thereof under this section only in accordance with a settlement agreement, final order, or judgment issued in such judicial process that complies with this section.

Procedures for recognition and enforceability of an out-of-country foreign judgment shall be as follows: (1) The out-of-country foreign judgment shall be filed with the clerk of the court and recorded in the public records in the county or counties where enforcement is sought. (a) At the time of the recording of an out-of-country foreign judgment, the judgment creditor shall make and record with the clerk of the circuit court an affidavit setting forth the name, social security number, if known, and last known post-office address of the judgment debtor and of the judgment creditor. (b) Promptly upon the recording of the out-of-country foreign judgment and the affidavit, the clerk shall mail notice of the recording of the out-of-country foreign judgment, by registered mail with return receipt requested, to the judgment debtor at the address given in the affidavit and shall make a note of the mailing in the docket.

(2) The judgment debtor shall have 30 days after service of the notice to file a notice of objection with the clerk of the court specifying the grounds for nonrecognition or nonenforceability under this act. (3) Upon the application of any party, and after proper notice, the circuit court shall have jurisdiction to conduct a hearing, determine the issues, and enter an appropriate order granting or denying recognition in accordance with the terms of this act. (4) If the judgment debtor fails to file a notice of objection within the required time, the clerk of the court shall record a certificate stating that no objection has been filed. (5) Upon entry of an order recognizing the out-of-country foreign judgment, or upon recording of the clerk’s certificate set forth above, the out-of-country foreign judgment shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment of a court of this state. (6) Once an order recognizing the out-of-country foreign judgment has been entered by a court of this state, the order and a copy of the judgment may be recorded in any other county of this state without further notice or proceedings, and shall be enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a court of this state. (7) A lien on real estate in any county shall be created only when there has been recorded in the official records of the county (a) a certified copy of the judgment, and (b) a copy of the clerk’s certificate or the order recognizing the out-of-country foreign judgment. The priority of such lien will be established as of the time the latter of the two recordings has occurred. (8) A judgment lien on personal property is acquired only when a judgment lien certificate is filed in accordance with s. 55.203 with the Department of State.

(e) The proceeding in the foreign court was contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court. (f) In the case of jurisdiction based only on personal service, the foreign court was a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action. (g) The foreign jurisdiction where judgment was rendered would not give recognition to a similar judgment rendered in this state. (h) The cause of action resulted in a defamation judgment obtained in a jurisdiction outside the United States, unless the court sitting in this state before which the matter is brought first determines that the defamation law applied in the foreign court’s adjudication provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press in that case as would be provided by the United States Constitution and the State Constitution.
