(b) An application for control shall be in such form and request such information as the commission requires by rule. (c) The application for control shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee of $7,500; however, if more than one association is being acquired in any such application, the fee shall be increased by $3,000 for each additional association. (2) The office shall issue the certificate of approval only after it has made an investigation and determined that: (a) The proposed new owner or owners of voting capital stock are qualified by character, experience, and financial responsibility to control the association in a legal and proper manner and none of the proposed new owners have been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a violation of s. 655.50, relating to the control of money laundering and terrorist financing; chapter 896, relating to offenses related to financial transactions; or similar state or federal law. (b) The interests of the public generally will not be jeopardized by the proposed purchase or acquisition of voting capital stock. (3) This section does not apply to the acquisition of: (a) Directors’ voting proxies acquired in the normal course of business as a result of proxy solicitation in conjunction with a stockholders’ meeting; (b) Stock in a fiduciary capacity unless the acquiring person has sole discretionary authority to exercise voting rights with respect thereto; (c) Stock acquired in securing or collecting a debt contracted in good faith until 2 years after the date of acquisition; (d) Stock acquired by an underwriter in good faith and without any intent to evade the purpose of this section if the shares are held only for such reasonable period of time as will permit the sale thereof; or (e) Control of an association by a unitary association holding company if the person or persons who control the holding company are the same person or persons who control the association. (4) For purposes of this section, a person or group of persons shall be deemed to have control of an association if such person or group of persons: (a) Directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more persons or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with powers to vote, or holds proxies representing 25 percent or more of the voting common stock of such association. (b) Controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of such association. (c) Exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of such association. (d) Owns, controls, or has power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the association, if no other person or group of persons owns, controls, or has power to vote a greater proportion of that class of voting securities. (e) In any case in which a proposed purchase or acquisition of voting securities of an association would give rise to the presumption created under paragraph (d), the person or group of persons who propose to purchase or acquire the voting securities shall first give written notice of the proposal to the office. Such notice may present information that the proposed purchase or acquisition will not result in control. The office shall afford the person seeking to rebut the presumption an opportunity to present views in writing or orally before its designated representatives at an informal conference. (5)(a) A foreign association, as defined in s. 665.1001, whether controlled directly or indirectly by another business organization, may acquire a Florida association, subject to approval by the office. The office shall not approve the proposed acquisition unless: 1. The laws of the state in which the foreign association has its principal place of business permit associations in that state to be acquired by Florida associations; and 2. The Florida association which is to be acquired has been in existence and continuously operating for more than 2 years. (b) The proposed acquisition shall be subject to any conditions, restrictions, and requirements that would apply in the state where the foreign association has its principal place of business if the foreign association were to be acquired by a Florida association, which conditions, restrictions, and requirements would not apply to the acquisition by such foreign association of another association in that state. (c) A foreign association which has a subsidiary association in Florida is authorized to acquire a Florida association upon approval by the office pursuant to the laws and rules which are applicable to the acquisition of a Florida association by an association having its principal place of business in this state, but such acquired association shall not be considered a Florida association for purposes of this subsection or s. 665.0315. (d) This subsection does not apply to any merger by an association subject to Pub. L. No. 97-320, s. 123.

(2) DOING BUSINESS.—No foreign association shall do any business of an association within this state or maintain an office in this state for the purpose of doing such business, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a branch office or other depository office. However, the establishment of a branch office as a result of the reorganization, merger, or consolidation of a foreign association and a Florida association is not prohibited if the laws of the state in which the resulting or surviving association has its principal place of business would permit the establishment of a branch of a Florida association in that state as a result of such a reorganization, merger, or consolidation. The origination of real estate mortgages covering real property located in this state is considered doing business as an association unless the state of domicile of the principal business office of any such foreign association permits associations from this state to originate real estate mortgages covering real property located in such state. (3) ACTION BY OFFICE.—The office is authorized, empowered, and directed to obtain an injunction or to take any other action necessary to prevent any foreign association from doing any business of an association in this state. (4) ACTIVITIES NOT CONSIDERED “DOING BUSINESS.”—For the purposes of this section and any other law of this state prohibiting, limiting, or regulating the doing of business in this state by foreign associations or foreign corporations of any type, any federal association, the principal office of which is located outside this state, and any foreign association which is subject to state or federal supervision, or both, which by law are subject to periodic examination by such supervisory authority and to a requirement of periodic audit, shall not be considered to be doing business in this state by reason of engaging in any of the following activities: (a) The purchase, acquisition, holding, sale, assignment, transfer, collecting, and enforcement of obligations or any interest therein secured by real estate mortgages or other instruments in the nature of a mortgage, covering real property located in this state, or the foreclosure of such instruments, or the acquisition of title to such property by foreclosure, or otherwise, as a result of default under such instruments, or the holding, protection, rental, maintenance, and operation of the property so acquired, or the disposition thereof; provided such associations shall not hold, own, or operate such property for a period exceeding 5 years without securing the approval of the office. (b) The advertising or solicitation of savings accounts or the making of any representations with respect thereto in this state through the medium of the mail, radio, television, magazines, or newspapers or any other medium which is published or circulated within this state; provided that such advertising, solicitation, or the making of such representations is accurately descriptive of the facts. (5) SERVICE OF PROCESS AND SUIT.—Any foreign association or federal association described in subsection (4) which engages in any of the activities described in paragraph (a) thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section shall in any connection therewith be subject to suit in the courts of this state by this state and the citizens of this state; and service on such association shall be effected by serving the Secretary of State of this state except that the provisions of this section shall have no other application to the question of whether any foreign association or federal association is subject to service of process and suit in this state as a result of the transaction of business or other activities in this state.
