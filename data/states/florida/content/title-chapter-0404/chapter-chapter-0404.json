The department shall establish, by rule, bonding criteria. In establishing such bonding criteria, the department shall consider: 1. The chemical and physical form of the licensed radioactive material. 2. The quantity of radioactive material authorized. 3. The particular radioisotopes authorized and their subsequent radiotoxicity. 4. The method in which the radioactive material is possessed, used, stored, processed, transferred, or disposed of. 5. The potential cost of decontamination, treatment, or disposal of a licensee’s equipment and facilities. (b) A person who possesses a specific license to commercially treat, store, or dispose of low-level radioactive waste shall be required to post a bond. (c) A bond deemed acceptable in this state shall be a bond issued by a fidelity or surety company authorized to do business in this state or a cash bond. (d) The department is authorized to exempt, by rule, any category of licensees from the requirement of paragraph (a) when a determination is made that such exemption will not result in a significant risk to the public health and safety or the environment and will not pose a financial risk to the state. (e) All state and local government agencies are exempt from this subsection. (2) In lieu of posting a bond as required under subsection (1), a licensee may: (a) Deposit with the Chief Financial Officer securities of the type eligible for deposit by insurers under s. 625.52, which securities must have at all times a market value of not less than the amount of the bond required under subsection (1). (b) Whenever the market value of the securities deposited with the Chief Financial Officer is less than 95 percent of the amount required by the department, the licensee shall deposit additional securities or otherwise increase the deposit to the amount required. (c) The state is responsible for the safekeeping of all securities deposited with the Chief Financial Officer under this section. Such securities are not, on account of being in this state, subject to taxation but shall be held exclusively and solely to guarantee the faithful performance by the licensee of its obligations. (d) The depositing licensee shall have the right to exchange or substitute other securities of like quality and value for securities so on deposit, to receive the interest and other income accruing to such securities, and to inspect the deposit at all reasonable times. (e) Such deposit shall be maintained unimpaired so long as the licensee continues in business in this state. Whenever the licensee ceases to do business in this state and furnishes the department satisfactory proof that it has discharged or otherwise adequately provided for all its obligations in this state, the Chief Financial Officer shall release the deposit securities to the parties entitled thereto, on the receipt of authorization from the department.

(2) The department shall require a person possessing a commercial low-level radioactive waste management license to deposit in a trust fund, quarterly, funds sufficient to provide for maintenance, monitoring, and surveillance of a facility, to be used after the person possessing such license completes the closure and postclosure observation and maintenance duties required by applicable federal and state laws and rules. (3) In order to provide for the proper care and surveillance of facilities subject to subsections (1) and (2), the state may acquire, by gift or transfer from another government agency or private person, any and all lands, buildings, and grounds necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. Any such gift or transfer is subject to approval and acceptance by the state. (4) The department may, by lease or license with any person, provide for the operation of a site or facility subject to this section for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. Any lessee or licensee operating under the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of this section. (5) The funds required by subsections (1) and (2) shall be established at such rate that interest on the sum of all funds reasonably anticipated as payable shall provide an annual amount equal to the anticipated reasonable costs necessary to maintain, monitor, and otherwise supervise and care for the lands and facilities as required in the interest of public health and safety. The department shall adopt and promulgate rules for the length of time and the amount of funds required to implement a program of maintenance, monitoring, and surveillance of a commercial low-level radioactive waste management facility, to be used after the operator completes the closure and postclosure observation and maintenance duties required by applicable federal and state laws and rules. In arriving at the rate of funds to be deposited, the department shall consider the nature of the radioactive material, including low-level radioactive waste, size and type of facility, estimated future receipts, and estimated future expenses of maintenance, monitoring, and supervision. (6) Recognizing the uncertainty of the existence of a person or corporation in perpetuity, and that ultimate responsibility to protect the public health and safety must be reposed in a solvent government, without regard to the existence of any particular agency or department thereof, all lands, buildings, and grounds acquired by the state under subsection (3) shall be owned in fee simple absolute by the state and dedicated in perpetuity to the purposes stated in subsection (3). All radioactive material, including low-level radioactive waste, received at such facility and located therein at time of acquisition of ownership by the state becomes the property of the state.

If, in the opinion of the department, a radiation machine that fails to meet such standards can be made to meet the standards through an adjustment or limitation upon the stations or range of the radiation machine or through the purchase of a component meeting the standards, the department shall order the owner of the radiation machine to make the necessary adjustment or to purchase the necessary component within 90 days after the date or receipt of the order. However, if the radiation machine cannot be made to meet the standards, the department shall order the owner to cease the use of the radiation machine. (2) Any person who enters the state with a radiation machine or component owned by him or her for the purpose of installing and utilizing the radiation machine shall register the radiation machine with the department. The department shall inspect the radiation machine to determine its compliance with the standards and shall approve or disapprove the radiation machine or shall order adjustments to the radiation machine in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1). Each person who installs or offers to install or service radiation machines must register with the department and must apply to the department, on forms furnished by the department, before furnishing or offering to furnish any such service. (3) No person shall sell or offer to sell in this state any radiation machine or component thereof which does not meet the standards of the department or which cannot be adjusted to meet such standards in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1). (4) The department shall enforce the provisions of this section and may impose an administrative fine, in addition to all other fines and penalties imposed by law, in an amount of $1,000 for each violation of this section. (5)(a) The department may charge and collect reasonable fees annually for the registration and inspection of radiation machines pursuant to this section. Such fees shall include the registration fee provided in s. 404.131 and shall be deposited into the Radiation Protection Trust Fund. Registration shall be on an annual basis. Registration shall consist of having the registrant file, on forms prescribed and furnished by the department, information which includes, but is not limited to: type and number of radiation machines, location of radiation machines, and changes in ownership. The department shall establish by rule a fee schedule based upon the actual costs incurred by the department in carrying out its registration and inspection responsibilities, including the salaries, expenses, and equipment of inspectors, but excluding costs of supervision and program administration. The fee schedule shall reflect differences in the frequency and complexity of inspections necessary to ensure that the radiation machines are functioning in accordance with the applicable standards developed pursuant to this chapter and rules adopted pursuant hereto. (b) The fee schedule and frequency of inspections shall be determined as follows: 1. Radiation machines which are used in the practice of medicine, chiropractic medicine, osteopathic medicine, or naturopathic medicine shall be inspected at least once every 2 years, but not more than annually, for an annual fee which is not less than $83 or more than $145 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $36 or more than $85 for each additional radiation machine therein. 2. Radiation machines which are used in the practice of veterinary medicine shall be inspected at least once every 3 years for an annual fee which is not less than $28 or more than $50 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $19 or more than $34 for each additional radiation machine therein. 3. Radiation machines which are used for educational or industrial purposes shall be inspected at least once every 3 years for an annual fee which is not less than $26 or more than $47 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $12 or more than $23 for each additional radiation machine therein. 4. Radiation machines which are used in the practice of dentistry or podiatric medicine shall be inspected at least once every 5 years but not more often than once every 4 years for an annual fee which is not less than $16 or more than $31 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $5 or more than $11 for each additional radiation machine therein. 5. Radiation machines which accelerate particles and are used in the healing arts shall be inspected at least annually for an annual fee which is not less than $153 or more than $258 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $87 or more than $148 for each additional radiation machine therein. 6. Radiation machines which accelerate particles and are used for educational or industrial purposes shall be inspected at least once every 2 years for an annual fee which is not less than $46 or more than $81 for the first radiation machine within an office or facility and not less than $26 or more than $48 for each additional radiation machine therein. 7. If a radiation machine fails to meet the applicable standards upon initial inspection, the department may reinspect the radiation machine and charge a reinspection fee in accordance with the same schedule of fees as in subparagraphs 1.-6. (6)(a) For purposes of this subsection, “mammography” means radiography of the breast for the purpose of enabling a physician to determine the presence, size, location, and extent of cancerous or potentially cancerous tissue in the breast. (b) All radiation machines used for mammography shall meet the accreditation criteria of the American College of Radiology or similar criteria established by the department. (c) All radiation machines used for mammography shall be specifically designed to perform mammography. (d) All radiation machines used for mammography shall be used exclusively to perform mammography. The department shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection. (7) Radiation machines that are used to intentionally expose a human being to the useful beam: (a) Must be maintained and operated according to manufacturer standards or nationally recognized consensus standards accepted by the department; (b) Must be operated at the lowest exposure that will achieve the intended purpose of the exposure; and (c) May not be modified in a manner that causes the original parts to operate in a way that differs from the original manufacturer’s design specification or the parameters approved for the machine and its components by the United States Food and Drug Administration. (8) A human being may be exposed to the useful beam of a radiation machine only under the following conditions: (a) For the purpose of medical or health care, if a licensed health care practitioner operating within the scope of his or her practice has determined that the exposure provides a medical or health benefit greater than the health risks posed by the exposure and the health care practitioner uses the results of the exposure in the medical or health care of the exposed individual; or (b) For the purpose of providing security for facilities or other venues, if the exposure is determined to provide a life safety benefit to the individual exposed which is greater than the health risk posed by the exposure. Such determination must be made by an individual trained in evaluating and calculating comparative mortality and morbidity risks according to standards set by the department. To be valid, the calculation and method of making the determination must be submitted to and accepted by the department. Limits to annual total exposure for security purposes must be adopted by department rule based on nationally recognized limits or relevant consensus standards.
