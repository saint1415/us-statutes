The term “radioactive waste” is further defined as follows:(a)“High-level waste” means irradiated reactor fuel, liquid wastes from reprocessing irradiated reactor fuel, and solids into which such liquid wastes have been converted.(b)“Low-level waste” means radioactive waste not classified as high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material as defined in s. 11(e)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.(c)“Transuranic waste” means waste material containing transuranic elements with contamination levels greater than 10 nanocuries per gram of waste.(15)“Registration” means the registering of a radiation machine with the department in accordance with the rules promulgated pursuant to this chapter.(16)“Source material” means:(a)Uranium, thorium, or any other material which the department declares to be source material after the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or any successor thereto, has determined the material to be such; or(b)Ores containing one or more of the foregoing materials in such concentration to be source material.(17)“Sources of radiation” means, collectively, radioactive material and radiation machines.(18)“Special nuclear material” means:(a)Plutonium, uranium 233, uranium 235, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which the department declares to be a special nuclear material after the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or any successor thereto, has determined the material to be such, but does not include source material; or(b)Any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.(19)“Specific license” means a license, issued after application, to use, manufacture, produce, transfer, receive, acquire, own, or possess quantities of, or devices or equipment utilizing, byproduct material, source material, special nuclear material, or other radioactive material occurring naturally or produced artificially.(20)“United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission” means the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its successor agency.(21)“Useful beam” means that portion of the radiation emitted from a radiation machine through the aperture of the machine’s beam-limiting device which is designed to focus the radiation on the intended target in order to accomplish the machine’s purpose when the machine’s exposure controls are in a mode to cause the system to produce radiation.History.—s. 1, ch. 78-373; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 3, 22, ch. 82-186; ss. 1, 17, 18, ch. 84-190; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 452, ch. 94-356; s. 55, ch. 97-237; s. 6, ch. 2020-133.Note.—Former s. 290.031.",
