To that end, it is hereby declared that every county ordinance and every municipal ordinance adopted prior to July 1, 1973, and relating to said subject shall stand abrogated and unenforceable on and after such date and that no county, municipality, or consolidated county-municipal government shall have the power to adopt any ordinance relating to the subject on or after such effective date. If ss. 847.07-847.09 are declared to be illegal, unconstitutional, or otherwise unenforceable, any county or municipal ordinance abrogated before ss. 847.07-847.09 were declared unconstitutional shall be in full force and effect, and each county, municipality, and consolidated county-municipal government shall have the power to adopt ordinances relating to this subject. (2) Nothing in ss. 847.07-847.09 shall be construed to repeal or in any way supersede the provisions of s. 847.011, s. 847.012, or s. 847.013. (3) Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the free exercise of free speech or picketing by any organization, group, or individual for the purpose of upholding community standards.

(b) “Person” means an individual, corporation, partnership, or any other legal or commercial entity. (c) “Video movie” means a videotape or video disc copy of a motion picture film.
