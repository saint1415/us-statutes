(2) Notice may be communicated in person; by telephone (where oral notice is permitted), telegraph, teletype, or other form of electronic transmission; or by mail. (3) Written notice by a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to conduct its affairs in this state to its member, if in a comprehensible form, is effective: (a) When mailed, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to the member’s address shown in the corporation’s current record of members; (b) When actually transmitted by facsimile telecommunication, if correctly directed to a number at which the member has consented to receive notice; (c) When actually transmitted by electronic mail, if correctly directed to an electronic mail address at which the member has consented to receive notice; (d) When posted on an electronic network that the member has consented to consult, upon the later of: 1. Such correct posting; or 2. The giving of a separate notice to the member of the fact of such specific posting; or (e) When correctly transmitted to the member, if by any other form of electronic transmission consented to by the member to whom notice is given. (4) Consent by a member to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the member by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (a) The corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, or other authorized person responsible for the giving of notice. However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action. (5) Written notice to a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to conduct its affairs in this state may be addressed to its registered agent at its registered office or to the corporation or its secretary at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in a domestic corporation’s articles of incorporation or in a foreign corporation’s application for certificate of authority. (6) Except as provided in subsection (3) or elsewhere in this act, written notice, if in a comprehensible form, is effective at the earliest date of the following: (a) When received; (b) Five days after its deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed; or (c) On the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee. (7) Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated directly to the person to be notified in a comprehensible manner. (8) An affidavit of the secretary, an assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or other authorized agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission is, in the absence of fraud, prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the notice. (9) If this act prescribes notice requirements for particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe notice requirements not less stringent than the requirements of this section or other provisions of this act, those requirements govern.

(3) If authorized by the board of directors, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, members and proxy holders who are not physically present at a meeting may, by means of remote communication: (a) Participate in the meeting. (b) Be deemed to be present in person and vote at the meeting if: 1. The corporation implements reasonable means to verify that each person deemed present and authorized to vote by means of remote communication is a member or proxy holder; and 2. The corporation implements reasonable measures to provide such members or proxy holders with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to communicate and to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrent with the proceedings. If any member or proxy holder votes or takes other action by means of remote communication, a record of that member’s participation in the meeting must be maintained by the corporation in accordance with s. 617.1601. (4) If any corporation, whether for profit or not for profit, is a member of a corporation organized under this chapter, the chair of the board, president, any vice president, the secretary, or the treasurer of the member corporation, and any such officer or cashier or trust officer of a banking or trust corporation holding such membership, and any like officer of a foreign corporation whether for profit or not for profit, holding membership in a domestic corporation, shall be deemed by the corporation in which membership is held to have the authority to vote on behalf of the member corporation and to execute proxies and written waivers and consents in relation thereto, unless, before a vote is taken or a waiver or consent is acted upon, it appears pursuant to a certified copy of the bylaws or resolution of the board of directors or executive committee of the member corporation that such authority does not exist or is vested in some other officer or person. In the absence of such certification, a person executing any such proxies, waivers, or consents or presenting himself or herself at a meeting as one of such officers of a corporate member shall be, for the purposes of this section, conclusively deemed to be duly elected, qualified, and acting as such officer and to be fully authorized. In the case of conflicting representation, the corporate member shall be represented by its senior officer, in the order stated in this subsection. (5) The articles of incorporation or the bylaws may provide that, in all elections for directors, every member entitled to vote has the right to cumulate his or her votes and to give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of votes he or she could give if one director were being elected multiplied by the number of directors to be elected or to distribute such votes on the same principles among any number of such candidates. A corporation may not have cumulative voting unless such voting is expressly authorized in the articles of incorporation. (6) If a corporation has no members or its members do not have the right to vote, the directors shall have the sole voting power. (7) Subsections (1), (5), and (6) do not apply to a corporation that is an association, as defined in s. 720.301, or a corporation regulated by chapter 718 or chapter 719.

Except as provided in paragraph (i), a majority of all votes of the directors, if the director was elected or appointed by the directors; or 2. A majority of all votes of the members, if the director was elected or appointed by the members. (b) If a director is elected by a class, chapter, or other organizational unit, or by region or other geographic grouping, the director may be removed only by the members of that class, chapter, unit, or grouping. However: 1. A director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect directors, except as provided in subparagraphs 2. and 3. 2. If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the removal of the director. 3. If at the beginning of the term of a director the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that the director may be removed for missing a specified number of board meetings, the board may remove the director for failing to attend the specified number of meetings. The director may be removed only if a majority of the directors then in office vote for the removal. (c) The notice of a meeting to recall a member or members of the board of directors shall state the specific directors sought to be removed. (d) A proposed removal of a director at a meeting shall require a separate vote for each director whose removal is sought. Where removal is sought by written consent, a separate consent is required for each director to be removed. (e) If removal is effected at a meeting, any vacancies created shall be filled by the members or directors eligible to vote for the removal. (f) Any director who is removed from the board is not eligible to stand for reelection until the next annual meeting at which directors are elected. (g) Any director removed from office shall turn over to the board of directors within 72 hours any and all records of the corporation in his or her possession. (h) If a director who is removed does not relinquish his or her office or turn over records as required under this section, the circuit court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located may summarily order the director to relinquish his or her office and turn over corporate records upon application of any member. (i) A director elected or appointed by the board may be removed without cause by a vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office or such greater number as is set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. (2) A director of a corporation described in s. 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code may be removed from office pursuant to procedures provided in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, and the corporation may provide in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws that it is subject to the provisions of subsection (1).

The board, by resolution adopted in accordance with and consistent with subsection (1), may designate one or more alternate members of any such committee who may act in the place and stead of any absent member or members at any meeting of such committee. (6) A committee member who is not a director has the same responsibility and fiduciary duties with respect to activities of such committee, and the same liability protections, as a committee member who is a director.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(a) only, a conflict-of-interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, who have no relationship or interest in the transaction described in subsection (1), but a transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no relationship or interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director having a relationship or interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under paragraph (1)(a) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in subsection (1), but such presence or vote of such a director may be counted for purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. (3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a conflict-of-interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority in interest of the members entitled to vote under this subsection. A director who has a relationship or interest in the transaction described in subsection (1) may not vote to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict-of-interest transaction under paragraph (1)(b). However, the vote of that director is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. A majority in interest of the members entitled to vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

      "text": "617.1408 Known claims against dissolved corporation.— (1) A dissolved corporation or successor entity may dispose of the known claims against it by following the procedures described in subsections (2), (3), and (4). (2) The dissolved corporation or successor entity shall deliver to each of its known claimants written notice of the dissolution at any time after its effective date. The written notice must: (a) Provide a reasonable description of the claim that the claimant may be entitled to assert; (b) State whether the claim is admitted or not admitted, in whole or in part, and, if admitted: 1. The amount that is admitted, which may be as of a given date; and 2. Any interest obligation if fixed by an instrument of indebtedness; (c) Provide a mailing address where a claim may be sent; (d) State the deadline, which must be at least 120 days after the effective date of the written notice, by which confirmation of the claim must be delivered to the dissolved corporation or successor entity; and (e) State that the corporation or successor entity may make distributions thereafter to other claimants and the members of the corporation or persons interested as having been such without further notice. (3) A dissolved corporation or successor entity may reject, in whole or in part, any claim made by a claimant pursuant to this section by mailing notice of such rejection to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of such claim and, in all events, at least 150 days before expiration of 3 years following the effective date of dissolution. The notice must be accompanied by a copy of this section. (4) A dissolved corporation or successor entity electing to follow the procedures described in subsections (2) and (3) must also give notice of dissolution to persons having known claims that are contingent upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events, or are otherwise conditional or unmatured, and request that such persons present such claims in accordance with the terms of the notice. The notice must be in substantially the same form, and sent in the same manner, as described in subsection (2). (5) A dissolved corporation or successor entity shall offer any claimant whose known claim is contingent, conditional, or unmatured such security as the corporation or entity determines is sufficient to provide compensation to the claimant if the claim matures. The dissolved corporation or successor entity shall deliver such offer to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of such claim and, in all events, at least 150 days before expiration of 3 years following the effective date of dissolution. If the claimant offered such security does not deliver in writing to the dissolved corporation or successor entity a notice rejecting the offer within 120 days after receipt of such offer, the claimant is deemed to have accepted such security as the sole source from which to satisfy his or her claim against the corporation. (6) A dissolved corporation or successor entity that has given notice in accordance with subsections (2) and (4) shall petition the circuit court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located or was located on the effective date of dissolution to determine the amount and form of security which is sufficient to provide compensation to a claimant who has rejected the offer for security made pursuant to subsection (5). (7) A dissolved corporation or successor entity that has given notice in accordance with subsection (2) shall petition the circuit court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located or was located on the effective date of dissolution to determine the amount and form of security which is sufficient to provide compensation to claimants whose claims are known to the corporation or successor entity but whose identities are unknown. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown in any proceeding brought under this subsection. The reasonable fees and expenses of such guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the petitioner in such proceeding. (8) The giving of any notice or making of any offer pursuant to this section does not revive any claim then barred, does not constitute acknowledgment by the dissolved corporation or successor entity that any person to whom such notice is sent is a proper claimant, and does not operate as a waiver of any defense or counterclaim in respect of any claim asserted by any person to whom such notice is sent. (9) A dissolved corporation or successor entity that has followed the procedures described in subsections (2)-(7) shall: (a) Pay the claims admitted or made and not rejected in accordance with subsection (3); (b) Post the security offered and not rejected pursuant to subsection (5); (c) Post any security ordered by the circuit court in any proceeding under subsections (6) and (7); and (d) Pay or make provision for all other known obligations of the corporation or the successor entity. Such claims or obligations shall be paid in full, and any provision for payments shall be made in full if there are sufficient funds. If there are insufficient funds, the claims and obligations shall be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims of equal priority, ratably to the extent of funds legally available for payment. Any remaining funds shall be distributed in accordance with s. 617.1406; however, such distribution may not be made until 150 days after the date of the last notice of rejections given pursuant to subsection (3). In the absence of actual fraud, the judgment of the directors of the dissolved corporation or the governing persons of the successor entity as to the provisions made for the payment of all obligations under this paragraph is conclusive. (10) A dissolved corporation or successor entity that has not followed the procedures described in subsections (2) and (3) shall pay or make reasonable provision to pay all known claims and obligations, including all contingent, conditional, or unmatured claims known to the corporation or the successor entity and all claims that are known to the dissolved corporation or the successor entity but for which the identity of the claimant is unknown. Such claims shall be paid in full, and any provision for payment made shall be made in full if there are sufficient funds. If there are insufficient funds, such claims and obligations shall be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims of equal priority, ratably to the extent of funds legally available for payment thereof. Any remaining funds shall be distributed in accordance with s. 617.1406. (11) Directors of a dissolved corporation or governing persons of a successor entity that has complied with subsection (9) or subsection (10) are not personally liable to the claimants of the dissolved corporation. (12) A member of a dissolved corporation the assets of which were distributed pursuant to subsection (9) or subsection (10) is not liable for any claim against the corporation greater than the member’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the member, whichever is less. (13) A member of a dissolved corporation, the assets of which were distributed pursuant to subsection (9), is not liable for any claim against the corporation which is known to the corporation or successor entity and on which a proceeding is begun after the expiration of 3 years following the effective date of dissolution. (14) The aggregate liability of any member of a dissolved corporation for claims against the dissolved corporation may not be greater than the amount distributed to the member in dissolution.

Issuance of the certificate of dissolution may be by electronic transmission to any corporation that has provided the department with an electronic mail address. (3) A corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not conduct any affairs except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its affairs under s. 617.1405 and adopt a plan of distribution of assets pursuant to s. 617.1406. (4) A director, officer, or agent of a corporation dissolved pursuant to this section, purporting to act on behalf of the corporation, is personally liable for the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the corporation arising from such action and incurred subsequent to the corporation’s administrative dissolution only if he or she has actual notice of the administrative dissolution at the time such action is taken; but such liability shall be terminated upon the ratification of such action by the corporation’s board of directors or members subsequent to the reinstatement of the corporation.

(6) The court may appoint an ancillary receiver for the assets and affairs of a corporation. The ancillary receiver shall serve ancillary to a receiver located in any other state, whenever the court deems that circumstances exist requiring the appointment of such a receiver. The court may appoint such an ancillary receiver for a foreign corporation even though a receiver has not been appointed elsewhere.

(2) If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation under s. 617.1530(2)-(7) or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Department of State that each ground determined by the Department of State does not exist within 60 days after issuance of notice, the Department of State shall revoke the foreign corporation’s certificate of authority by issuing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date.

(2) The deposit of such report, on or before May 1, in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, properly addressed with postage prepaid, constitutes compliance with subsection (1). (3) If an annual report does not contain the information required by subsection (1), the Department of State shall promptly notify the reporting domestic or foreign corporation in writing and return the report to it for correction. If the report is corrected to contain the information required by subsection (1) and delivered to the Department of State within 30 days after the effective date of notice, it is deemed to be timely filed. (4) Each annual report must be executed by the corporation by an officer or director or, if the corporation is in the hands of a receiver or trustee, must be executed on behalf of the corporation by such receiver or trustee, and the signing of the annual report shall have the same legal effect as if made under oath, without the necessity of appending such oath thereto. (5) The first annual report must be delivered to the Department of State between January 1 and May 1 of the year following the calendar year in which a domestic corporation was incorporated or a foreign corporation was authorized to conduct affairs. Subsequent annual reports must be delivered to the Department of State between January 1 and May 1 of the subsequent calendar years. (6) Information in the annual report must be current as of the date the annual report is executed on behalf of the corporation. (7) If an additional report is received, the department shall file the document and make the information contained therein part of the official record. (8) Any corporation that fails to file an annual report which complies with the requirements of this section may not maintain or defend any action in any court of this state until such report is filed and all fees and taxes due under this act are paid, and such corporation is subject to dissolution or cancellation of its certificate of authority to conduct its affairs as provided in this act. (9) The department shall prescribe the forms on which to make the annual report called for in this section and may substitute the uniform business report, pursuant to s. 606.06, as a means of satisfying the requirement of this section.

(5) The domestication of any not-for-profit corporation in this state does not affect any obligations or liabilities that it incurred before its domestication. (6) The filing of a certificate of domestication does not affect the choice of law applicable to the corporation, except that, after the date the certificate of domestication is filed, the law of this state, applies to the corporation to the same extent as if it had been incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation of this state on that date. (7) The certificate of domestication shall be signed by any corporate officer, director, trustee, manager, partner, or other person performing functions equivalent to those of an officer or director, however named or described, who is authorized to sign the certificate of domestication on behalf of the corporation. (8) When a domestication becomes effective: (a) The title to all real and personal property, both tangible and intangible, of the foreign corporation remains in the domesticated corporation without reversion or impairment; (b) The liabilities of the foreign corporation remain the liabilities of the domesticated corporation; (c) An action or proceeding against the foreign corporation continues against the domesticated corporation as if the domestication had not occurred; (d) The articles of incorporation attached to the certificate of domestication constitute the articles of incorporation of the domesticated corporation; and (e) Membership interests in the foreign corporation remain identical in the domesticated corporation.
