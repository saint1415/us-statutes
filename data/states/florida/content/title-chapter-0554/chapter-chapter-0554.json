      "text": "554.103 Boiler code.—The department shall adopt by rule a State Boiler Code for the safe construction, installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of boilers in this state. The rules adopted shall be based upon and shall at all times follow generally accepted nationwide engineering standards, formulas, and practices pertaining to boiler construction and safety. (1) The department shall adopt an existing code for new construction and installation known as the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, including all amendments and interpretations to the A.S.M.E. Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code approved by the A.S.M.E. Council on Codes and Standards subsequent to the adoption of the State Boiler Code, and when so adopted by the department, such amendments and interpretations become a part of the State Boiler Code. (2) The installer of any boiler placed in use in this state after January 1, 2018, must, before installing the boiler, apply on a form adopted by rule of the department for a permit to install the boiler from the chief boiler inspector. The application must include the boiler’s A.S.M.E. manufacturer’s data report and other documents required by the State Boiler Code before the boiler is placed in service. The installer must contact the chief boiler inspector to schedule an inspection for each boiler no later than 7 days before the boiler is placed in service. (3) The maximum allowable working pressure of a boiler carrying the A.S.M.E. code symbol must be determined by the applicable sections of the code under which it was constructed and stamped. Subject to the concurrence of the chief boiler inspector, such boiler may be rerated in accordance with the standards of the State Boiler Code. (4) The maximum allowable working pressure of a boiler that does not carry the A.S.M.E. code symbol must be computed in accordance with the standards of the State Boiler Code. (5) This chapter may not be construed to in any way prevent the use, sale, or reinstallation of a boiler if such boiler has been made to conform to the applicable provisions of the State Boiler Code governing existing installations and if, upon inspection, the boiler has been found to be in a safe condition. (6) The department, at its discretion, may authorize the construction, installation, and operation of boilers of special design or construction which do not meet the specific requirements of the State Boiler Code, but which are consistent with the intent of the safety objectives of the code. (7) The department may adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to administer this chapter. Such rules may include specifying the procedures and forms to be used to obtain an installation permit, an initial certificate, or a renewal certificate, and the submission of reports and notices required under this chapter.

      "heading": "Inspection",
      "text": "554.108 Inspection.— (1) The inspection requirements of this chapter apply only to boilers located in public assembly locations. A boiler with an input of 200,000 British thermal units (Btu) per hour and above, up to an input not exceeding 400,000 Btu per hour, is exempt from inspection; however, such an exempt boiler, if manufactured after July 1, 2022, must be stamped with the A.S.M.E. code symbol. Additionally, the A.S.M.E. data report of a boiler with an input of 200,000 to 400,000 Btu per hour must be filed as required under s. 554.103(2). (2) Each inspection of a boiler conducted pursuant to this chapter must be made by the chief boiler inspector, a deputy boiler inspector, or a special boiler inspector. An owner, or the owner’s designee, shall perform all operation, testing, manipulation of boiler controls and safety devices, removal of lagging, and disassembly of boiler components to allow the chief boiler inspector, deputy boiler inspector, or special boiler inspector to conduct inspections as required by this section. (3) The construction, installation, and condition of each boiler used in a public assembly location shall be inspected as follows: (a) Power boilers and high pressure, high temperature water boilers shall receive a certificate inspection annually. Such inspection shall include, but not be limited to, an external inspection while the boiler is under pressure and an internal inspection if the construction of the boiler so permits. (b) Low pressure steam or vapor heating boilers shall receive a certificate inspection biennially. Such inspection shall include, but not be limited to, an internal inspection if the construction of the boiler so permits. (c) Hot water heating boilers and hot water supply boilers shall receive a certificate inspection biennially. Such boilers shall receive an internal inspection every 4 years if the construction of the boiler so permits. (4) Each boiler subject to inspection must be inspected within 30 days after expiration of the boiler’s certificate of operation. However, an inspection report must be received by the chief boiler inspector no later than 30 days after the projected expiration date of the certificate of operation. If, upon inspection, the chief boiler inspector, deputy boiler inspector, or special boiler inspector finds that a boiler is in violation of any provision of the State Boiler Code, the inspector must promptly notify the owner or user and state what repairs or other corrective measures are needed. Deputy boiler inspectors and special boiler inspectors shall file a written report, on a form adopted by rule of the department, on each certificate inspection with the chief boiler inspector within 15 days after the inspection. A certificate inspection report must list all violations of the State Boiler Code and any conditions that may adversely affect the operation of the boiler. The filing of reports of inspections, other than statutorily required inspections, is not required unless such inspections disclose that a boiler is in an unsafe condition or unless the boiler has failed and requires major repair or replacement. The inspection report must list the extent of damage to the boiler, as well as the cause of the failure, if known, and any other pertinent information. However, an inspection report must be filed for any inspection performed on a boiler with a previously identified code violation. The report must indicate whether the violation has been corrected. The agency responsible for conducting the inspection must perform followup inspections, not more than every 6 months, of a previously identified code violation until it is corrected. (5) Upon a determination by the chief boiler inspector that a boiler cannot be safely operated, the boiler must immediately be shut down. The chief boiler inspector or a deputy boiler inspector shall attach a tag to the boiler indicating that the boiler has been shut down due to an unsafe condition. The boiler must remain shut down until a reinspection by the chief boiler inspector or a deputy boiler inspector determines that the boiler may be operated safely. A boiler that may not be safely operated, as determined by the chief boiler inspector, is deemed to constitute an imminent danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. (6) Each enclosed space or room containing a boiler regulated under this chapter which is fired by the direct application of energy from the combustion of fuels and which is located in any portion of a public lodging establishment under s. 509.242 shall be equipped with one or more carbon monoxide detector devices. (7) The department may adopt rules necessary to administer this section. History.—s. 8, ch. 87-361; s. 1, ch. 88-303; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 9, ch. 2017-175; s. 20, ch. 2022-138.

Such certificate must bear the date of the inspection and specify the maximum pressure at which the boiler may be operated. (2) The certificate for a power boiler or a high pressure, high temperature water boiler is valid for a period of 12 months from the date of the certificate inspection. The certificate for a heating boiler or a hot water supply boiler is valid for a period of 24 months from the date of the certificate inspection. The certificate must be posted under glass, or be similarly protected, in the room containing the boiler. (3) A boiler insurance company shall notify the chief boiler inspector within 30 days after the issuance of a new or renewal boiler and machinery insurance policy, or the cancellation or nonrenewal of a boiler and machinery insurance policy, covering places of public assembly in this state. (4) If the chief boiler inspector has knowledge that a boiler regulated under this chapter was covered by a boiler and machinery insurance policy after its most recent certification inspection, the certificateholder must, upon the request of the chief boiler inspector, submit its certificate of boiler and machinery insurance for the boiler if the department has not received the special boiler inspector’s annual inspection report within 30 days after its due date.
