      "text": "420.9071 Definitions.—As used in ss. 420.907-420.9079, the term: (1) “Adjusted for family size” means adjusted in a manner that results in an income eligibility level that is lower for households having fewer than four people, or higher for households having more than four people, than the base income eligibility determined as provided in subsection (20), subsection (21), or subsection (30), based upon a formula established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. (2) “Affordable” means that monthly rents or monthly mortgage payments including taxes and insurance do not exceed 30 percent of that amount which represents the percentage of the median annual gross income for the households as indicated in subsection (20), subsection (21), or subsection (30). However, it is not the intent to limit an individual household’s ability to devote more than 30 percent of its income for housing, and housing for which a household devotes more than 30 percent of its income shall be deemed affordable if the first institutional mortgage lender is satisfied that the household can afford mortgage payments in excess of the 30 percent benchmark. The term also includes housing provided by a not-for-profit corporation that derives at least 75 percent of its annual revenues from contracts or services provided to a state or federal agency for low-income persons and low-income households; that provides supportive housing for persons who suffer from mental health issues, substance abuse, or domestic violence; and that provides on-premises social and community support services relating to job training, life skills training, alcohol and substance abuse disorders, child care, and client case management.
