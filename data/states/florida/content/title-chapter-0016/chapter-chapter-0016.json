      "text": "16.0155 Contingency fee agreements.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Department” means the Department of Legal Affairs. (b) “Private attorney” means any private attorney or law firm. (2) The department may not enter into a contingency fee contract with a private attorney unless the Attorney General makes a written determination prior to entering into such a contract that contingency fee representation is both cost-effective and in the public interest. Any written determination shall include specific findings for each of the following factors: (a) Whether there exist sufficient and appropriate legal and financial resources within the department to handle the matter. (b) The time and labor required; the novelty, complexity, and difficulty of the questions involved; and the skill requisite to perform the attorney services properly. (c) The geographic area where the attorney services are to be provided. (d) The amount of experience desired for the particular kind of attorney services to be provided and the nature of the private attorney’s experience with similar issues or cases. (3) Notwithstanding the exemption provided in s. 287.057(3)(e), if the Attorney General makes the determination described in subsection (2), he or she shall request proposals from private attorneys to represent the department on a contingency-fee basis, unless the Attorney General determines in writing that requesting proposals is not feasible under the circumstances. The written determination does not constitute a final agency action subject to review pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. For purposes of this subsection only, the department is exempt from s. 120.57(3), and neither the request for proposals nor the contract award is subject to challenge pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (4) In addition to the requirements set forth in s. 287.059(16), any private attorney shall maintain detailed contemporaneous time records for the attorneys and paralegals working on the matter in increments of no greater than 1/10 of an hour and shall promptly provide these records to the department, upon request. (5) Notwithstanding s. 287.059(7)(a), the department may not enter into a contingency fee contract that provides for the private attorney to receive an aggregate contingency fee in excess of: (a) Twenty-five percent of any recovery of up to $10 million; plus (b) Twenty percent of any portion of such recovery between $10 million and $15 million; plus (c) Fifteen percent of any portion of such recovery between $15 million and $20 million; plus (d) Ten percent of any portion of such recovery between $20 million and $25 million; plus (e) Five percent of any portion of such recovery exceeding $25 million. In no event shall the aggregate contingency fee exceed $50 million, exclusive of reasonable costs and expenses, and irrespective of the number of lawsuits filed or the number of private attorneys retained to achieve the recovery. (6) Copies of any executed contingency fee contract and the Attorney General’s written determination to enter into a contingency fee contract with the private attorney shall be posted on the department’s website for public inspection within 5 business days after the date the contract is executed and shall remain posted on the website for the duration of the contingency fee contract, including any extensions or amendments thereto. Any payment of contingency fees shall be posted on the department’s website within 15 days after the payment of such contingency fees to the private attorney and shall remain posted on the website for at least 365 days thereafter. (7) By February 1 of each year, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives describing the use of contingency fee contracts with private attorneys in the preceding calendar year. At a minimum, the report shall: (a) Identify all new contingency fee contracts entered into during the year and all previously executed contingency fee contracts that remain current during any part of the year, and for each contract describe: 1. The name of the private attorney with whom the department has contracted, including the name of the attorney’s law firm; 2. The nature and status of the legal matter; 3. The name of the parties to the legal matter; 4. The amount of any recovery; and 5. The amount of any contingency fee paid. (b) Include copies of any written determinations made under subsection (2) during the year. History.—s. 1, ch. 2010-7; s. 1, ch. 2011-4; s. 11, ch. 2013-154.

Upon securing such grants, the funds shall be deposited in the “Crime Stoppers Trust Fund.” (b) The proceeds of the court cost imposed by s. 938.06 shall be deposited in a separate account in the trust fund, and within that account the funds shall be designated according to the judicial circuit in which they were collected. The funds in this account shall be used as provided in paragraph (5)(b). (c) After an initial distribution of funds to the judicial circuit in which they were collected, up to 50 percent of the unencumbered funds returned to the Crime Stoppers Trust Fund from that circuit from a previous grant year, may, in subsequent grant years, be reallocated to other judicial circuits for special crime stoppers initiatives or other programs of the Florida Association of Crime Stoppers, as prioritized and determined by the department and the Florida Association of Crime Stoppers. (5)(a) The department shall be the disbursing authority for the distribution of funding to units of local government which apply to the department for funding assistance. (b) Funds deposited in the trust fund pursuant to paragraph (4)(b) shall be disbursed as provided in this paragraph. A county may apply to the department under s. 938.06 for a grant from the funds collected in the judicial circuit in which the county is located. A grant may be awarded only to counties that are served by an official member of the Florida Association of Crime Stoppers and may be used only to support Crime Stoppers and its crime fighting programs. Only one such official member is eligible for support within any county. To aid the department in determining eligibility, the secretary of the Florida Association of Crime Stoppers shall furnish the department with a schedule of authorized crime stoppers programs and shall update the schedule as necessary. The department shall award grants to eligible counties from available funds and shall distribute funds as equitably as possible, based on amounts collected within each county, if more than one county is eligible within a judicial circuit. (c) A county that is awarded a grant under this section may use such funds to purchase and distribute promotional items to increase public awareness of, and to educate the public about, Crime Stoppers. (d) Grants may be awarded to fund student crime watch programs pursuant to s. 1006.07(3). (e) A county that is awarded a grant under this section may use such funds to pay rewards for tips that result in any of the following: 1. An arrest. 2. The recovery of stolen property. 3. The recovery of illegal narcotics. 4. The recovery of the body of a homicide victim. 5. The recovery of a human trafficking victim or a missing person connected to criminal activity. 6. The recovery of an illegal firearm or an illegal weapon on a K-12 school campus. 7. The prevention of a terrorist act. 8. The solving and closing of a criminal case involving a homicide or other violent felony offense that remains unsolved for 1 year or more after being reported to a law enforcement agency and that has no viable and unexplored investigatory leads. (6) The department shall adopt and enforce rules to implement the provisions of this act. Such rules shall include, but shall not be limited to: (a) Criteria for local governments to apply for funding from the “Crime Stoppers Trust Fund” in order to aid in local law enforcement as provided in this section. (b) The limits of funding to be distributed to local government units based on a pro rata share of grants made available through the “Crime Stoppers Trust Fund” pursuant to paragraph (4)(a), and criteria for the equitable distribution of funds available pursuant to paragraph (4)(b).

In developing the training, the institute shall consult with law enforcement agencies, survivors of human trafficking, industry representatives, tourism representatives, and other interested parties. The institute also must conduct research to determine the reduction in recidivism attributable to the education of the harms of human trafficking for first-time offenders. (c) The institute shall serve as a repository of information on human trafficking and training materials and resources to recognize and prevent human trafficking. (d) The human trafficking task force in each circuit, pursuant to s. 409.1754(4), shall coordinate on an ongoing basis with the institute, at least every 6 months, to update training and information on best practices to combat human trafficking. (e) Sheriffs’ offices and local law enforcement agencies may coordinate with the institute to receive updated training and information on best practices. (f) The direct-support organization shall develop training for firesafety inspectors in the recognition and reporting of human trafficking.

The use must be for the approved purposes of the direct-support organization and may not be made at times or places that would unreasonably interfere with opportunities for the general public to use departmental facilities. (b) The department shall prescribe by agreement conditions with which the direct-support organization must comply in order to use department property, facilities, or personnel. Such conditions must provide for budget and audit review and oversight by the department. (c) The department may not authorize the use of property, facilities, or personnel of the council, department, or designated program by the direct-support organization which does not provide equal employment opportunities to all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin. (8)(a) The direct-support organization may conduct programs and activities; raise funds; request and receive grants, gifts, and bequests of money; acquire, receive, hold, invest, and administer, in its own name, securities, funds, objects of value, or other property, real or personal; and make expenditures to or for the direct or indirect benefit of the council or designated program. (b) Notwithstanding s. 287.025(1)(e), the direct-support organization may enter into contracts to insure the property of the council or designated programs and may insure objects or collections on loan from other entities in satisfying security terms of the lender. (9) A departmental employee, a direct-support organization or council employee, a volunteer, or a director of a designated program may not: (a) Receive a commission, fee, or financial benefit in connection with serving on the council; or (b) Be a business associate of any individual, firm, or organization involved in the sale or the exchange of real or personal property to the direct-support organization, the council, or a designated program.

      "text": "16.711 Division of Gaming Enforcement; creation; duties.— (1) There is created within the Florida Gaming Control Commission a Division of Gaming Enforcement. The Division of Gaming Enforcement shall be considered a criminal justice agency as defined in s. 943.045. (2) The commissioners shall appoint a director of the Division of Gaming Enforcement who is qualified by training and experience in law enforcement or security to supervise, direct, coordinate, and administer all activities of the division. (3) The director and all investigators employed by the division must meet the requirements for employment and appointment provided by s. 943.13 and must be certified as law enforcement officers as defined in s. 943.10(1). The director and such investigators shall be designated law enforcement officers and shall have the power to detect, apprehend, and arrest for any alleged violation of chapter 24, part II of chapter 285, chapter 546, chapter 550, chapter 551, or chapter 849, or any rule adopted pursuant thereto, or any law of this state. Such law enforcement officers may enter upon any premises at which gaming activities are taking place in the state for the performance of their lawful duties and may take with them any necessary equipment, and such entry does not constitute a trespass. In any instance in which there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred, such officers have the authority, without warrant, to search and inspect any premises where the violation is alleged to have occurred or is occurring. Any such officer may, consistent with the United States and Florida Constitutions, seize or take possession of any papers, records, tickets, currency, or other items related to any alleged violation. Investigators employed by the commission shall also have access to, and shall have the right to inspect, premises licensed by the commission, to collect taxes and remit them to the officer entitled to them, and to examine the books and records of all persons licensed by the commission. (4)(a) The division and its investigators are specifically authorized to seize any contraband in accordance with the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. For purposes of this section, the term “contraband” has the same meaning as the term “contraband article” in s. 932.701(2)(a)2. (b) The division is specifically authorized to store and test any contraband that is seized in accordance with the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act and may authorize any of its staff to implement this paragraph. (c) This subsection does not limit the authority of any other person authorized by law to seize contraband. (5) The Department of Law Enforcement shall provide assistance in obtaining criminal history information relevant to investigations required for honest, secure, and exemplary gaming operations, and such other assistance as may be requested by the executive director of the commission and agreed to by the executive director of the Department of Law Enforcement. Any other state agency, including the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Revenue, shall, upon request, provide the commission with any information relevant to any investigation conducted pursuant to this section. The commission shall reimburse any agency for the actual cost of providing any assistance pursuant to this subsection. History.—s. 3, ch. 2021-269.
