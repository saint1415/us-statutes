      "heading": "Finance charge; maximum rates.",
      "text": "516.031 Finance charge; maximum rates.— (1) INTEREST RATES.—A licensee may lend any sum of money up to $25,000. A licensee may not take a security interest secured by land on any loan less than $1,000. The licensee may charge, contract for, and receive thereon interest charges as provided and authorized by this section. The maximum interest rate shall be 36 percent per annum, computed on the first $10,000 of the principal amount; 30 percent per annum on that part of the principal amount exceeding $10,000 and up to $20,000; and 24 percent per annum on that part of the principal amount exceeding $20,000 and up to $25,000. The original principal amount as used in this section is the same as the amount financed as defined by the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In determining compliance with the statutory maximum interest and finance charges set forth herein, the computations used shall be simple interest and not add-on interest or any other computations. If two or more interest rates are applied to the principal amount of a loan, the licensee may charge, contract for, and receive interest at that single annual percentage rate which, if applied according to the actuarial method to each of the scheduled periodic balances of principal, would produce at maturity the same total amount of interest as would result from the application of the two or more rates otherwise permitted, based upon the assumption that all payments are made as agreed. (2) ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE UNDER FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT.—The annual percentage rate of finance charge which may be contracted for and received under any loan contract made by a licensee under this chapter may equal, but not exceed, the annual percentage rate which must be computed and disclosed as required by the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The maximum annual percentage rate of finance charge which may be contracted for and received is 12 times the maximum monthly rate, and the maximum monthly rate shall be computed on the basis of one-twelfth of the annual rate for each full month. The commission shall by rule establish the rate for each day in a fraction of a month when the period for which the charge is computed is more or less than 1 month. (3) OTHER CHARGES.— (a) In addition to the interest, delinquency, and insurance charges provided in this section, further or other charges or amount for any examination, service, commission, or other thing or otherwise may not be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, or received as a condition to the grant of a loan, except: 1. An amount of up to $25 to reimburse a portion of the costs for investigating the character and credit of the person applying for the loan; 2. An annual fee of $25 on the anniversary date of each line-of-credit account; 3. Charges paid for the brokerage fee on a loan or line of credit of more than $10,000, title insurance, and the appraisal of real property offered as security if paid to a third party and supported by an actual expenditure; 4. Intangible personal property tax on the loan note or obligation if secured by a lien on real property; 5. The documentary excise tax and lawful fees, if any, actually and necessarily paid out by the licensee to any public officer for filing, recording, or releasing in any public office any instrument securing the loan, which may be collected when the loan is made or at any time thereafter; 6. The premium payable for any insurance in lieu of perfecting any security interest otherwise required by the licensee in connection with the loan if the premium does not exceed the fees which would otherwise be payable, which may be collected when the loan is made or at any time thereafter; 7. Actual and reasonable attorney fees and court costs as determined by the court in which suit is filed; 8. Actual and commercially reasonable expenses for repossession, storing, repairing and placing in condition for sale, and selling of any property pledged as security; or 9. A delinquency charge for each payment in default for at least 12 days if the charge is agreed upon, in writing, between the parties before imposing the charge. Delinquency charges may be imposed as follows: a. For payments due monthly, the delinquency charge for a payment in default may not exceed $15. b. For payments due semimonthly, the delinquency charge for a payment in default may not exceed $7.50. c. For payments due every 2 weeks, the delinquency charge for a payment in default may not exceed $7.50 if two payments are due within the same calendar month, and may not exceed $5 if three payments are due within the same calendar month. Any charges, including interest, in excess of the combined total of all charges authorized and permitted by this chapter constitute a violation of chapter 687 governing interest and usury, and the penalties of that chapter apply. In the event of a bona fide error, the licensee shall refund or credit the borrower with the amount of the overcharge immediately but within 20 days after the discovery of such error. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), any lender of money who receives a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or like instrument drawn on a bank or other depository institution, which instrument is given by a borrower as full or partial repayment of a loan, may, if such instrument is not paid or is dishonored by such institution, make and collect from the borrower a bad check charge of not more than the greater of $20 or an amount equal to the actual charge made to the lender by the depository institution for the return of the unpaid or dishonored instrument. (4) DIVIDED LOANS.—No licensee shall induce or permit any borrower to split up or divide any loan. No licensee shall induce or permit any person, or any husband and wife, jointly or severally, to become obligated to the licensee, directly or contingently or both, under more than one contract of loan at the same time, for the purpose, or with the result, of obtaining a greater finance charge than would otherwise be permitted by this section. (5) UNPAID INTEREST UPON REFINANCING.—If all or part of the consideration for a new loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan with the licensee, the principal amount payable under the new loan contract may include not more than 60 days’ unpaid interest accrued on the prior loan. (6) PREPAYMENT PENALTIES PROHIBITED.—A licensee may not require a borrower to pay a prepayment penalty for paying all or part of the loan principal before the date on which the payment is due.

This subsection does not restrict a licensee that claims a religious purpose from making such determinations based on the current or prospective customer’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations. (2) It is an unsafe and unsound practice for a licensee to deny or cancel its services to a person, or to otherwise discriminate against a person in making available such services or in the terms or conditions of such services, on the basis of: (a) The person’s political opinions, speech, or affiliations; (b) Except as provided in subsection (1), the person’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations; (c) Any factor if it is not a quantitative, impartial, and risk-based standard, including any such factor related to the person’s business sector; or (d) The use of any rating, scoring, analysis, tabulation, or action that considers a social credit score based on factors including, but not limited to: 1. The person’s political opinions, speech, or affiliations. 2. The person’s religious beliefs, religious exercise, or religious affiliations. 3. The person’s lawful ownership of a firearm. 4.

The person’s engagement in the exploration, production, utilization, transportation, sale, or manufacture of fossil fuel-based energy, timber, mining, or agriculture. 6. The person’s support of the state or Federal Government in combating illegal immigration, drug trafficking, or human trafficking. 7. The person’s engagement with, facilitation of, employment by, support of, business relationship with, representation of, or advocacy for any person described in this paragraph. 8. The person’s failure to meet or commit to meet, or expected failure to meet, any of the following as long as such person is in compliance with applicable state or federal law: a. Environmental standards, including emissions standards, benchmarks, requirements, or disclosures; b. Social governance standards, benchmarks, or requirements, including, but not limited to, environmental or social justice; c. Corporate board or company employment composition standards, benchmarks, requirements, or disclosures based on characteristics protected under the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; or d. Policies or procedures requiring or encouraging employee participation in social justice programming, including, but not limited to, diversity, equity, or inclusion training.

(4) In addition to any sanctions and penalties under this chapter, a failure to comply with subsection (1) or engaging in a practice described in subsection (2) constitutes a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act under part II of chapter 501. Notwithstanding s. 501.211, violations must be enforced only by the enforcing authority, as defined in s. 501.203(2), and subject the violator to the sanctions and penalties provided for in that part.

      "text": "516.05 License.— (1) Upon the filing of an application for a license and payment of all applicable fees, the office shall, unless the application is to renew or reactivate an existing license, make an investigation of the facts concerning the applicant’s background. If the office determines that a license should be granted, it shall issue the license for a period not to exceed 2 years. Biennial licensure periods and procedures for renewal of licenses shall be established by the rule of the commission. If the office determines that grounds exist under this chapter for denial of an application other than an application to renew a license, it shall deny such application. (2) A license that is not renewed at the end of the biennium established by the commission shall automatically revert to inactive status. An inactive license may be reactivated upon submission of a completed reactivation application, payment of the biennial license fee, and payment of a reactivation fee which shall equal the biennial license fee. A license expires on the date at which it has been inactive for 6 months. (3) Only one place of business for the purpose of making loans under this chapter may be maintained under one license, but the office may issue additional licenses to a licensee upon compliance with all the provisions of this chapter governing issuance of a single license. (4) Each licensee shall report, on a form prescribed by rule of the commission, any change to the information contained in any initial application form or any amendment to such application not later than 30 days after the change is effective. (5) Each licensee shall report any changes in the partners, officers, members, joint venturers, directors, or control persons of any licensee, or changes in the form of business organization, by written amendment in such form and at such time as the commission specifies by rule. (a) In any case in which a person or a group of persons, directly or indirectly or acting by or through one or more persons, proposes to purchase or acquire a controlling interest in a licensee, such person or group must submit an initial application for licensure before such purchase or acquisition at such time and in such form as the commission prescribes by rule. (b) As used in this subsection, the term “controlling interest” means possession of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise. Any person who directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25 percent or more of the voting securities of a company or is entitled to 25 percent or more of the company’s profits is presumed to possess a controlling interest. (c) Any addition of a partner, officer, member, joint venturer, director, or control person of the applicant who does not have a controlling interest and who has not previously complied with the provisions of s. 516.03(1) shall be subject to such provisions unless required to file an initial application in accordance with paragraph (a). If the office determines that the licensee does not continue to meet licensure requirements, the office may bring administrative action in accordance with s. 516.07 to enforce the provisions of this chapter. (d) The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 providing for the waiver of the application required by this subsection if the person or group of persons proposing to purchase or acquire a controlling interest in a licensee has previously complied with the provisions of s. 516.03(1) with the same legal entity or is currently licensed with the office under this chapter. (6) A licensee may conduct the business of making loans under this chapter within a place of business in which other business is solicited or engaged in, unless the office shall find that the conduct of such other business by the licensee results in an evasion of this chapter. Upon such finding, the office shall order the licensee to desist from such evasion; provided, however, that no license shall be granted to or renewed for any person or organization engaged in the pawnbroker business. (7) Licenses are not transferable or assignable. A licensee may invalidate any license by delivering it to the office with a written notice of the delivery, but such delivery does not affect any civil or criminal liability or the authority to enforce this chapter for acts committed in violation thereof. (8) The office may refuse to process an initial application for a license if the applicant or any person with power to direct the management or policies of the applicant’s business is the subject of a pending criminal prosecution in any jurisdiction until conclusion of such criminal prosecution. (9) A licensee who is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filing must report such filing to the office within 7 business days after the filing date. (10)(a) In lieu of the $25,000 liquid asset requirement in s. 516.03(1): 1. An applicant or a licensee may provide to the office a surety bond in the amount of at least $25,000, issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in this state. 2. A company with at least one currently licensed location must provide to the office a rider or surety bond, in the amount of at least $5,000 for each additional license, issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in this state. However, in no event may the aggregate amount of the surety bond required for a company with multiple licenses exceed $100,000. (b) In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant or the licensee may provide evidence of a certificate of deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount of the surety bond required under paragraph (a). The certificate of deposit must be deposited in a financial institution, as defined in s. 655.005(1)(i). The letter of credit must be issued by a financial institution, as defined in s. 655.005(1)(i). (c) The original surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit must be filed with the office, and the office must be named as beneficiary. The surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit must be for the use and benefit of any borrower who is injured by acts of a licensee involving fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, including willful imposition of illegal or excessive charges; or misrepresentation, circumvention, or concealment of any matter required to be stated or furnished to a borrower, where such acts are in connection with a loan made under this chapter. The office, or any claimant, may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction on the surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit. The surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit must be payable on a pro rata basis, but the aggregate amount may not exceed the amount of the surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit. (d) The surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit may not be canceled by the licensee, bonding or insurance company, or financial institution except upon notice to the office by certified mail. A cancellation may not take effect until 30 calendar days after receipt by the office of the notice. (e) The bonding or insurance company or financial institution must, within 10 calendar days after it pays a claim, give notice to the office by certified mail of such payment with details sufficient to identify the claimant and the claim or judgment paid. (f) If the principal sum of the surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit is reduced by one or more recoveries or payments, the licensee must furnish to the office a new or additional surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit so that the total or aggregate principal sum equals the amount required under this subsection. Alternatively, a licensee may furnish an endorsement executed by the bonding or insurance company or financial institution reinstating the required principal amount. (g) The required surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit must remain in place for 2 years after the licensee ceases licensed operations in this state. During the 2-year period, the office may allow for a reduction or elimination of the surety bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit to the extent the licensee’s outstanding consumer finance loans in this state are reduced.

(3) Permit payment of the loan in whole or in part prior to its maturity with interest on such payment to the date thereof. (4) Upon repayment of the loan in full, mark indelibly every paper signed by the borrower with the word “Paid” or “Canceled” and release any mortgage, restore any pledge, cancel and return any note, and cancel and return any assignment given by the borrower as security. (5) In the event of a Federal Emergency Management Agency response to a Presidential Disaster Declaration in the state, if the licensee offers any assistance program to borrowers impacted by the disaster, within 10 days after the licensee’s establishment of the program, send written notice to the office in physical or electronic format and include all of the following information, subject to change as any additional declaration is issued or any declaration is revoked: (a) The licensed locations affected by the disaster declaration, including the physical addresses, if applicable. (b) The telephone number, e-mail address, or other contact information for the licensee. (c) A brief description of the assistance program available to borrowers in the affected areas. (d) The start date, and end date if known, of the assistance program. For purposes of this subsection, assistance programs may include, but are not limited to, deferments, forbearance, waivers of late fees, payment modifications, or changes in payment due dates. (6) Offer the borrower at the time a loan is made a credit education program or seminar provided, in writing or by electronic means, by the licensee or a third-party provider. The credit education program or seminar may address, but need not be limited to, any of the following topics: (a) The importance and methodology of establishing a household budget. (b) The impact of, value of, and ways to improve a credit score. (c) The importance and methodology of establishing household savings. (d) Ways to obtain a free copy of a credit report. (e) Ways to dispute an error in a credit report. (f) Ways to manage and prevent identity theft.
