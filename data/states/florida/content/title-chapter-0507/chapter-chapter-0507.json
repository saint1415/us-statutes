The spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran must provide to the department a copy of the veteran’s DD Form 214, as issued by the United States Department of Defense, or another acceptable form of identification as specified by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and a copy of a valid marriage license or certificate verifying that he or she was lawfully married to the veteran at the time of discharge; or 3.

(4) A registration must be renewed biennially on or before its expiration date. In order to establish staggered expiration dates, the department may extend the expiration date of a registration for a period not to exceed 12 months.

A registration issued under this chapter is not assignable, and the mover or moving broker may not conduct business under more than one name except as registered. A mover or moving broker desiring to change its registered name or location or designated agent for service of process at a time other than upon renewal of registration must notify the department of the change. (8) The department may deny, refuse to renew, or revoke the registration of any mover or moving broker based upon a determination that the mover or moving broker, or any of the mover’s or moving broker’s directors, officers, owners, or general partners: (a) Has failed to meet the requirements for registration as provided in this chapter; (b) Has been convicted of a crime involving fraud, dishonest dealing, or any other act of moral turpitude; (c) Has not satisfied a civil fine or penalty arising out of any administrative or enforcement action brought by any governmental agency or private person based upon conduct involving fraud, dishonest dealing, or any violation of this chapter; (d) Has pending against him or her any criminal, administrative, or enforcement proceedings in any jurisdiction, based upon conduct involving fraud, dishonest dealing, or any other act of moral turpitude; or (e) Has had a judgment entered against him or her in any action brought by the department or the Department of Legal Affairs under this chapter or ss. 501.201-501.213, the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

A moving broker must notify the department of any changes to the provided information. The department shall publish and maintain on its website a list of all moving brokers and the registered movers each moving broker is contracted with. (12) A person required to register pursuant to this section may not operate as or hold itself out to be a mover or moving broker without first registering with the department pursuant to this section. (13) The department must immediately issue a cease and desist order to a person upon finding that the person is operating as a mover or a moving broker without registering pursuant to this section. In addition, and notwithstanding the availability of any administrative relief under chapter 120, the department may seek from the appropriate circuit court an immediate injunction prohibiting the person from operating in this state until the person complies with this section and pays a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 and court costs.
