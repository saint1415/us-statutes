(b) Invest and reinvest the assets of the firefighters’ pension trust fund in: 1. Time or savings accounts of a national bank, a state bank insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, or a savings, building, and loan association insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a state or federal chartered credit union whose share accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. 2. Obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government of the United States. 3. Bonds issued by the State of Israel. 4. Bonds, stocks, or other evidences of indebtedness issued or guaranteed by a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state or organized territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, if: a. The corporation is listed on any one or more of the recognized national stock exchanges or on the National Market System of the NASDAQ Stock Market and, in the case of bonds only, holds a rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service; and b. The board of trustees may not invest more than 5 percent of its assets in the common stock or capital stock of any one issuing company, nor may the aggregate investment in any one issuing company exceed 5 percent of the outstanding capital stock of that company or the aggregate of its investments under this subparagraph at cost exceed 50 percent of the assets of the fund. This paragraph applies to all boards of trustees and participants. However, if a municipality or special fire control district has a duly enacted pension plan pursuant to, and in compliance with, s. 175.351, and the trustees desire to vary the investment procedures, the trustees of such plan must request a variance of the investment procedures as outlined herein only through a municipal ordinance, special act of the Legislature, or resolution by the governing body of the special fire control district; if a special act, or a municipality by ordinance adopted before July 1, 1998, permits a greater than 50-percent equity investment, such municipality is not required to comply with the aggregate equity investment provisions of this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section may not be construed to take away any preexisting legal authority to make equity investments that exceed the requirements of this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of trustees may invest up to 25 percent of plan assets in foreign securities on a market-value basis. The investment cap on foreign securities may not be revised, amended, increased, or repealed except as provided by general law. (c) Issue drafts upon the firefighters’ pension trust fund pursuant to this act and rules prescribed by the board of trustees. All such drafts must be consecutively numbered, be signed by the chair and secretary, or by two individuals designated by the board who are subject to the same fiduciary standards as the board of trustees under this subsection, and state upon their faces the purpose for which the drafts are drawn. The treasurer or depository of each municipality or special fire control district shall retain such drafts when paid, as permanent vouchers for disbursements made, and no money may be otherwise drawn from the fund. (d) Convert into cash any securities of the fund. (e) Keep a complete record of all receipts and disbursements and the board’s acts and proceedings. (2) Any and all acts and decisions shall be effectuated by vote of a majority of the members of the board; however, no trustee shall take part in any action in connection with the trustee’s own participation in the fund, and no unfair discrimination shall be shown to any individual firefighter participating in the fund. (3) The board’s action on all claims for retirement under this act shall be final, provided, however, that the rules and regulations of the board have been complied with. (4) The secretary of the board of trustees shall keep a record of all persons receiving retirement payments under the provisions of this chapter, in which shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the pension shall cease to be paid. In this record, the secretary shall keep a list of all firefighters employed by the municipality or special fire control district. The record shall show the name, address, and time of employment of such firefighters and when they cease to be employed by the municipality or special fire control district. (5) The sole and exclusive administration of, and the responsibilities for, the proper operation of the firefighters’ pension trust fund and for making effective the provisions of this chapter are vested in the board of trustees; however, nothing herein shall empower a board of trustees to amend the provisions of a retirement plan without the approval of the municipality or special fire control district. The board of trustees shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for an actuarial valuation of the firefighters’ pension trust fund and for checking the actual experience of the fund. (6)(a) At least once every 3 years, the board of trustees shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant who shall evaluate the performance of any existing professional money manager and shall make recommendations to the board of trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term. These recommendations shall be considered by the board of trustees at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The date, time, place, and subject of this meeting shall be advertised in the same manner as for any meeting of the board. (b) For purposes of this subsection, the term “professionally qualified independent consultant” means a consultant who, based on education and experience, is professionally qualified to evaluate the performance of professional money managers, and who, at a minimum: 1. Provides his or her services on a flat-fee basis. 2. Is not associated in any manner with the money manager for the pension fund. 3. Makes calculations according to the American Banking Institute method of calculating time-weighted rates of return. All calculations must be made net of fees. 4. Has 3 or more years of experience working in the public sector. (7) To assist the board in meeting its responsibilities under this chapter, the board, if it so elects, may: (a) Employ independent legal counsel at the pension fund’s expense. (b) Employ an independent enrolled actuary, as defined in s. 175.032, at the pension fund’s expense. (c) Employ such independent professional, technical, or other advisers as it deems necessary at the pension fund’s expense. If the board chooses to use the municipality’s or special district’s legal counsel or actuary, or chooses to use any of the municipality’s or special district’s other professional, technical, or other advisers, it must do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. (8) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(b) and as provided in s. 215.473, the board of trustees must identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any scrutinized company, as defined in that section, and proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in that company beginning January 1, 2010. The divestiture of any such security must be completed by September 30, 2010. The board and its named officers or investment advisors may not be deemed to have breached their fiduciary duty in any action taken to dispose of any such security, and the board shall have satisfactorily discharged the fiduciary duties of loyalty, prudence, and sole and exclusive benefit to the participants of the pension fund and their beneficiaries if the actions it takes are consistent with the duties imposed by s. 215.473, and the manner of the disposition, if any, is reasonable as to the means chosen. For the purposes of effecting compliance with that section, the pension fund shall designate terror-free plans that allocate their funds among securities not subject to divestiture. No person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the board of trustees or any employee, officer, director, or advisor of such pension fund based upon the divestiture of any security pursuant to this subsection.

(2) Individual policies shall be purchased only when a group insurance plan is not feasible. (3) Each application and policy shall designate the firefighters’ pension trust fund as owner of the policy. (4) Policies shall be written on an annual premium basis. (5) The type of policy shall be one which for the premium paid provides each individual with the maximum retirement benefit at his or her earliest statutory normal retirement age. (6) Death benefit, if any, should not exceed: (a) One hundred times the estimated normal retirement income, based on the assumption that the present rate of compensation continues without change to normal retirement date, or (b) Twice the annual rate of compensation as of the date of termination of service, or (c) The single-sum value of the accrued deferred retirement income (beginning at normal retirement date) at date of termination of service, whichever is greatest. (7) An insurance plan may provide that the assignment of insurance contract to separating firefighters shall be at least equivalent to the return of the firefighters’ contributions used to purchase the contract. An assignment of contract discharges the municipality or special fire control district, as appropriate, from all further obligation to the participant under the plan even though the cash value of such contract may be less than the firefighters’ contributions. (8) Provisions shall be made, either by issuance of separate policies or otherwise, that the separating firefighter does not receive cash value and other benefits under the policies assigned to him or her which exceed the present value of his or her vested interest under the firefighters’ pension trust fund, inclusive of his or her contribution to the plan; the contributions by the state shall not be exhausted faster merely because the method of funding adopted was through insurance companies. (9) The firefighter shall have the right at any time to give the board of trustees written instructions designating the primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive death benefits or proceeds and the method of settlement of the death benefit or proceeds, or requesting a change in the beneficiary designation or method of settlement previously made, subject to the terms of the policy or policies on his or her life. Upon receipt of such written instructions, the board of trustees shall take necessary steps to effectuate the designation or change of beneficiary or settlement option.

Whenever a municipality maintains a firefighters’ pension trust fund under the provisions of this chapter but is partially contained within the boundaries of a special fire control district, that portion of the 1.85-percent excise, license, or other similar tax which is collected for insurance policies covering property within the jurisdiction of both the municipality and the special fire control district shall be given to the firefighters’ pension trust fund of the fire service provider. Remaining revenues collected pursuant to this chapter shall be distributed to the municipality or special fire control district according to the location of the insured property. (b) Except as reduced or increased contributions are authorized by subsection (2), by the payment to the fund of 5 percent of the salary of each uniformed firefighter who is a member or duly enrolled in the fire department of any municipality or special fire control district, which 5 percent shall be deducted by the municipality or special fire control district from the compensation due to the firefighter and paid over to the board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund wherein such firefighter is employed. No firefighter shall have any right to the money so paid into the fund except as provided in this chapter. (c) By all fines and forfeitures imposed and collected from any firefighter because of the violation of any rule and regulation promulgated by the board of trustees. (d) By mandatory payment by the municipality or special fire control district of a sum equal to the normal cost of and the amount required to fund any actuarial deficiency shown by an actuarial valuation conducted under part VII of chapter 112 after taking into account the amounts described in paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g) and the tax proceeds described in paragraph (a) which are used to fund benefits in a defined benefit plan component. (e) By all gifts, bequests, and devises when donated to the fund. (f) By all accretions to the fund by way of interest or dividends on bank deposits, or otherwise. (g) By all other sources or income now or hereafter authorized by law for the augmentation of such firefighters’ pension trust fund. (2) Member contribution rates may be adjusted as follows: (a) The employing municipality or special fire control district, by local ordinance or resolution, may elect to make an employee’s contributions. However, under no circumstances may a municipality or special fire control district reduce the member contribution to less than one-half of 1 percent of salary. (b) Firefighter member contributions may be increased by consent of the members’ collective bargaining representative or, if none, by majority consent of firefighter members of the fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require adjustment of member contribution rates in effect on the date this act becomes a law, including rates that exceed 5 percent of salary, provided that such rates are at least one-half of 1 percent of salary.

Insurance companies that do not use the electronic database provided by the Department of Revenue or that do not exercise due diligence in applying the electronic database for tax years on or after January 1, 2006, are subject to a 0.5 percent penalty on the portion of the premium pertaining to any insured risk that is improperly assigned, whether assigned to an improper local taxing jurisdiction, not assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction when it should be assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction, or assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction when it should not be assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction. (b) Any insurance company that is obligated to report and remit the excise tax on commercial property insurance premiums imposed under s. 175.101 and is unable, after due diligence, to assign an insured property to a specific local taxing jurisdiction for purposes of complying with paragraph (a) shall remit the excise tax on commercial property insurance premiums using a methodology of apportionment in a manner consistent with the remittance for the 2004 calendar year. An insurance company which makes two contacts with the agent responsible for a commercial property insurance application for the purpose of verifying information on the application necessary for the assignment to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction shall be considered to have exercised due diligence. Any insurance company which complies with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be subject to the penalty provided in paragraph (a). (2)(a) The Department of Revenue shall, subject to legislative appropriation, create as soon as practical and feasible, and thereafter shall maintain, an electronic database that conforms to any format approved by the American National Standards Institute’s Accredited Standards Committee X12 and that designates for each street address and address range in the state, including any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the local taxing jurisdiction in which the street address and address range is located, and the appropriate code for each such participating local taxing jurisdiction, identified by one nationwide standard numeric code. The nationwide standard numeric code must contain the same number of numeric digits, and each digit or combination of digits must refer to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States and must be in a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission. Each address or address range must be provided in standard postal format, including the street number, street number range, street name, and zip code. Each year after the creation of the initial database, the Department of Revenue shall annually create and maintain a database for the current tax year. Each annual database must be calendar-year specific. (b)1. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall furnish to the Department of Revenue all information needed to create the electronic database as soon as practical and feasible. The information furnished to the Department of Revenue must specify an effective date. 2. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall furnish to the Department of Revenue all information needed to create and update the current year’s database, including changes in annexations, incorporations, and reorganizations and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries, as well as changes in eligibility to participate in the excise tax imposed under this chapter. The information must specify an effective date and must be furnished to the Department of Revenue by July 1 of the current year. 3. The Department of Revenue shall create and update the current year’s database in accordance with the information furnished by participating local taxing jurisdictions under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., as appropriate. To the extent practicable, the Department of Revenue shall post each new annual database on a website by September 1 of each year. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall have access to this website and, within 30 days thereafter, shall provide any corrections to the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall finalize the current year’s database and post it on a website by November 1 of the current year. If a dispute in jurisdictional boundaries cannot be resolved so that changes in boundaries may be included, as appropriate, in the database by November 1, the changes may not be retroactively included in the current year’s database and the boundaries will remain the same as in the previous year’s database. The finalized database must be used in assigning policies and premiums to the proper local taxing jurisdiction for the insurance premium tax return due on the following March 1 for the tax year 2005. For subsequent tax years, the finalized database must be used in assigning policies and premiums to the proper local taxing jurisdiction for the insurance premium tax return due for the tax year beginning on or after the January 1 following the website posting of the database. Information contained in the electronic database is conclusive for purposes of this chapter. The electronic database is not an order, a rule, or a policy of general applicability. 4. Each annual database must identify the additions, deletions, and other changes to the preceding version of the database. (3)(a) As used in this section, the term “due diligence” means the care and attention that is expected from and is ordinarily exercised by a reasonable and prudent person under the circumstances. (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an insurance company is exercising due diligence if the insurance company complies with the provisions of paragraph (1)(b) or if the insurance company assigns an insured’s premium to local taxing jurisdictions in accordance with the Department of Revenue’s annual database and with respect to such database: 1. Expends reasonable resources to accurately and reliably implement such method; 2. Maintains adequate internal controls to correctly include in its database of policyholders the location of the property insured, in the proper address format, so that matching with the department’s database is accurate; and 3. Corrects errors in the assignment of addresses to local taxing jurisdictions within 120 days after the insurance company discovers the errors. (4) There is annually appropriated from the moneys collected under this chapter and deposited in the Police and Firefighter’s Premium Tax Trust Fund an amount sufficient to pay the expenses of the Department of Revenue in administering this section, but not to exceed $50,000 annually, adjusted annually by the lesser of a 5-percent increase or the percentage of growth in the total collections. (5) The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules necessary to administer this section, including rules establishing procedures and forms. (6) Any insurer that is obligated to collect and remit the tax on property insurance imposed under s. 175.101 shall be held harmless from any liability, including, but not limited to, liability for taxes, interest, or penalties that would otherwise be due solely as a result of an assignment of an insured property to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction, based on the collection and remission of the tax accruing before January 1, 2005, if the insurer collects and reports this tax consistent with filings for periods before January 1, 2005. Further, any insurer that is obligated to collect and remit the tax on property insurance imposed under this section is not subject to an examination under s. 624.316 or s. 624.3161 which would occur solely as a result of an assignment of an insured property to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction, based on the collection and remission of such tax accruing before January 1, 2005.

      "text": "175.162 Requirements for retirement.—For any municipality, special fire control district, chapter plan, local law municipality, local law special fire control district, or local law plan under this chapter, any firefighter who completes 10 or more years of creditable service as a firefighter and attains age 55, or completes 25 years of creditable service as a firefighter and attains age 52, and who for such minimum period has been a member of the firefighters’ pension trust fund operating under a chapter plan or local law plan, is eligible for normal retirement benefits. Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the municipality or special fire control district on or after the normal retirement date. In such event, payment of retirement income will be governed by the following provisions of this section: (1) The normal retirement date of each firefighter will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which he or she has completed 10 or more years of creditable service and attained age 55 or completed 25 years of creditable service and attained age 52. (2)(a)1. The amount of monthly retirement income payable to a full-time firefighter who retires on or after his or her normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of his or her years of credited service multiplied by 2.75 percent of his or her average final compensation as a full-time firefighter. 2. Effective July 1, 2015, a plan that is in compliance with this chapter except that the plan provides a benefit that is less than 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a full-time firefighter for all years of credited service or provides an effective benefit that is less than 2.75 percent as a result of a maximum benefit limitation: a. Must maintain, at a minimum, the percentage amount or maximum benefit limitation in effect on July 1, 2015, and is not required to increase the benefit to 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a full-time firefighter for all years of credited service; or b. If the plan changes the percentage amount or maximum benefit limitation to 2.75 percent or more of the average final compensation of a full-time firefighter for all years of credited service, the plan may not thereafter decrease the percentage amount or maximum benefit limitation to less than 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a full-time firefighter for all years of credited service. (b) The amount of monthly retirement income payable to a volunteer firefighter who retires on or after his or her normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of his or her years of credited service multiplied by 2 percent of his or her average final compensation as a volunteer firefighter. (3) The monthly retirement income payable in the event of normal retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the firefighter’s normal retirement date, or on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his or her actual retirement, if later, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the firefighter’s death; except that, in the event the firefighter dies after retirement but before he or she has received retirement benefits for a period of 10 years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as designated by the firefighter for the balance of such 10-year period. If a firefighter continues in the service of the municipality or special fire control district beyond his or her normal retirement date and dies prior to his or her date of actual retirement, without an option made pursuant to s. 175.171 being in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made for a period of 10 years to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the firefighter as if the firefighter had retired on the date on which his or her death occurred. (4) Early retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the municipality or special fire control district, with the consent of the municipality or special fire control district, as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the firefighter’s normal retirement date but subsequent to the date as of which he or she has both attained the age of 50 years and has been a member of this fund for 10 continuous years. In the event of early retirement, payment of retirement income shall be governed as follows: The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a firefighter who retires prior to his or her normal retirement date shall be in the amount computed as described in subsection (2), taking into account the firefighter’s credited service to his or her date of actual retirement and final monthly compensation as of such date, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the firefighter’s younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income benefits. The amount of monthly income payable in the event of early retirement will be paid in the same manner as in subsection (3). In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed 3 percent for each year by which the member’s age at retirement preceded the member’s normal retirement age, as provided in subsection (1).

(b) A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the firefighter during the joint lifetime of the firefighter and a joint annuitant designated by the firefighter, and following the death of either of them, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent, or 50 percent of such monthly amounts payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. (c) Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefits as, in the opinion of the board of trustees, will best meet the circumstances of the retiring firefighter. 1. The firefighter upon electing any option of this section must designate the joint annuitant or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of his or her death, and may change such designation, but any such change shall be deemed a new election and is subject to approval by the board of trustees. Such designation must name a joint annuitant or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a firefighter has elected an option with a joint annuitant or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits have commenced, the firefighter may change the designated joint annuitant or beneficiary, but only if the board of trustees consents to such change and if the joint annuitant last designated by the firefighter is alive when the firefighter files with the board of trustees a request for such change. 2. The consent of a firefighter’s joint annuitant or beneficiary to any such change is not required. 3. The board of trustees may request evidence of the good health of the joint annuitant that is being removed, and the amount of the retirement income payable to the firefighter upon designation of a new joint annuitant shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the age and gender of the former joint annuitant, the new joint annuitant, and the firefighter. Each designation must be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees and filed with the board of trustees. If no designated beneficiary survives the firefighter, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the firefighter subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in s. 175.181. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, a retired firefighter may change his or her designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two times as provided in s. 175.333 without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. (2) Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: (a) If a firefighter dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under s. 175.201. (b) If the designated beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the firefighter’s retirement under the plan, the option elected is canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount is payable to the firefighter upon retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the firefighter before retirement and within 90 days after the death of the beneficiary. (c) If both the retired firefighter and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by him or her die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1)(c), the board of trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with s. 175.181. (d) If a firefighter continues beyond his or her normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of s. 175.162(1) and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the firefighter in the amount or amounts computed as if the firefighter had retired under the option on the date on which death occurred. (3) No firefighter may make any change in his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing the first retirement check.

Such retirement shall herein be referred to as “disability retirement.” (2) A firefighter will be considered totally disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, he or she is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter; and a firefighter will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, he or she is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than is specified in subsection (3). (3) A firefighter will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a result of: (a) Excessive and habitual use by the firefighter of drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics; (b) Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, or civil insurrections or while committing a crime; (c) Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while serving in any armed forces; or (d) Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter after his or her employment has terminated. (4) No firefighter shall be permitted to retire under the provisions of this section until he or she is examined by a duly qualified physician or surgeon, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and is found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified in this section. Any firefighter retiring under this section may be examined periodically by a duly qualified physician or surgeon or board of physicians and surgeons, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. (5) The benefit payable to a firefighter who retires from the service of a municipality or special fire control district due to total and permanent disability as a direct result of a disability is the monthly income payable for 10 years certain and life for which, if the firefighter’s disability occurred in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall be the accrued retirement benefit, but shall not be less than 42 percent of his or her average monthly salary at the time of disability. If after 10 years of service the disability is other than in the line of duty, the firefighter’s monthly benefit shall be the accrued normal retirement benefit, but shall not be less than 25 percent of his or her average monthly salary at the time of disability. (6) The monthly retirement income to which a firefighter is entitled in the event of his or her disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be, if the firefighter recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery or, if the firefighter dies without recovering from the disability, the payment due next preceding his or her death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. In lieu of the benefit payment as provided in this paragraph, a firefighter may select an optional form as provided in s. 175.171. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled firefighter shall be paid to the firefighter’s designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as provided in ss. 175.181 and 175.201. (7) If the board of trustees finds that a firefighter who is receiving a disability retirement income is no longer disabled, as provided herein, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. “Recovery from disability” as used herein means the ability of the firefighter to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter. (8) If the firefighter recovers from disability and reenters the service as a firefighter, service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he or she reentered the service may not be considered as credited service for the purpose of this plan.

The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: (1) The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality or special fire control district if additional assets are required, in which event the municipality or special fire control district shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. (2) The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). (3) The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the employee’s accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the employee. (4) If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the municipality or special fire control district, less return to the state of the state’s contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality or special fire control district and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality or special fire control district and the state. (5) The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the municipality or special fire control district or the board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

      "text": "175.401 Retiree health insurance subsidy.—For any municipality, special fire control district, chapter plan, local law municipality, local law special fire control district, or local law plan under this chapter, under the broad grant of home rule powers under the State Constitution and chapter 166, municipalities have the authority to establish and administer locally funded health insurance subsidy programs. In addition, special fire control districts may, by resolution, establish and administer locally funded health insurance subsidy programs. Pursuant thereto: (1) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to allow municipalities and special fire control districts the option to use premium tax moneys, as provided for under this chapter, to establish and administer health insurance subsidy programs which will provide a monthly subsidy payment to retired members of any firefighters’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter, or to beneficiaries who are spouses or financial dependents entitled to receive benefits under such a plan, in order to assist such retired members or beneficiaries in paying the costs of health insurance. (2) RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY TRUST FUNDS; ESTABLISHMENT AND TERMINATION.— (a) Any municipality or special fire control district having a firefighters’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter may, in its discretion, establish by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, a trust fund to be known as the firefighters’ retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund. This fund may be a separate account established for such purpose in the existing firefighters’ pension fund, provided that all funds deposited in such account are segregated from, and not commingled with, pension funds or other public moneys and that the account otherwise conforms to the requirements of subsection (8). The trust fund shall be used to account for all moneys received and disbursed pursuant to this section. (b) Prior to the second reading of the ordinance before the municipal legislative body, or of the resolution before the governing body of the special fire control district, an actuarial valuation must be performed by an enrolled actuary as provided in s. 112.63, and copies of the valuation and the proposed implementing ordinance or resolution shall be furnished to the division. (c) The subsidy program may, at the discretion of the municipal governing body, be permanently discontinued by municipal ordinance, and at the discretion of the governing body of a special fire control district may be permanently discontinued by resolution, at any time, subject to the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions established for plan termination and fund distribution under s. 175.361. (3) FUNDING.—Trust funds established pursuant to this section shall be funded in the following manner: (a) By payment to the fund of an amount equivalent to one-half of the net increase over the previous tax year in the premium tax funds provided for in this chapter, said amount to be established in the implementing ordinance or resolution. (b) By no less than one-half of 1 percent of the base salary of each firefighter, for so long as the firefighter is employed and covered by a pension plan established pursuant to this chapter. The municipality or special fire control district, with approval of the board of trustees, may increase member contributions if needed to fund benefits greater than the minimums established in this section. (c) By payment by the municipality or special fire control district, on at least a quarterly basis, of whatever sum is determined necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of the fund in accordance with s. 112.64. Such contributions and payments shall be submitted to the board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 175.351, and deposited in the firefighters’ retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund, in the same manner and subject to the same time constraints as provided under s. 175.131. (4) ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY.—A person who has contributed to the retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund and retires under a firefighters’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter, including any local law plan as provided under s. 175.351, or a beneficiary who is a spouse or financial dependent entitled to receive benefits under such a plan, is eligible for health insurance subsidy payments provided under this section. However, the fund, with approval of the board of trustees and approval of the municipality or special fire control district, may provide coverage to retirees and beneficiaries when the retirees have not contributed to the fund as provided in subsection (3). Payment of the retiree health insurance subsidy shall be made only after coverage for health insurance for the retiree or beneficiary has been certified in writing to the board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund. (5) RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY AMOUNT.—Beginning on the effective date established in the implementing ordinance or resolution, each eligible retiree, or beneficiary who is a spouse or financial dependent thereof, shall receive a monthly retiree health insurance subsidy payment equal to the aggregate number of years of service, as defined in s. 175.032, completed at the time of retirement multiplied by an amount determined in the implementing ordinance or resolution, but no less than $3 for each year of service. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the plan sponsor from establishing, in the implementing ordinance or resolution, a cap of no less than 30 years upon the number of years’ service for which credit will be given toward a health insurance subsidy or a maximum monthly subsidy amount. (6) PAYMENT OF RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY.—Beginning on the effective date established in the implementing ordinance or resolution, any monthly retiree health insurance subsidy amount due and payable under this section shall be paid to retired members, or their eligible beneficiaries, by the board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 175.351, in the same manner as provided by s. 175.071(1)(c) for drafts upon the pension fund. (7) INVESTMENT OF THE TRUST FUND.—The trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 175.351, are hereby authorized to invest and reinvest the funds of the firefighters’ retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as apply hereunder to the investment of firefighters’ pension funds under s. 175.071. (8) DEPOSIT OF HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY FUNDS.—All funds of the health insurance subsidy fund may be deposited by the board of trustees with the treasurer of the municipality or special fire control district, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he or she is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the municipality or special fire control district. Any funds so deposited shall be segregated by the treasurer in a separate fund, clearly identified as funds of the health insurance subsidy fund. In lieu thereof, the board of trustees shall deposit the funds of the health insurance subsidy fund in a qualified public depository as defined in s. 280.02, which shall conform to and be bound by the provisions of chapter 280 with regard to such funds. In no case shall the funds of the health insurance subsidy fund be deposited in any financial institution, brokerage house trust company, or other entity that is not a public depository as provided by s. 280.02. (9) SEPARATION FROM SERVICE; REFUNDS.—Any firefighter who terminates employment with a municipality or special fire control district having a retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund system or plan as provided under this section shall be entitled to a refund of all employee contributions he or she made to that trust fund, without interest, regardless of whether the firefighter has vested for purposes of retirement. Any firefighter who has vested for purposes of retirement in the service of the municipality or special fire control district, and has contributed to the firefighters’ retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund for so long as he or she was eligible to make such contributions, may, in his or her discretion, elect to leave his or her accrued contributions in the fund, whereupon, such firefighter shall, upon retiring and commencing to draw retirement benefits, receive a health insurance subsidy based upon his or her aggregate number of years of service, as defined in s. 175.032. (10) ADMINISTRATION OF SYSTEM; ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS; AUDITS; RULES; ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.—The board of trustees of the firefighters’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 175.351, shall be solely responsible for administering the health insurance subsidy trust fund. Pursuant thereto: (a) As part of its administrative duties, no less frequently than every 3 years, the board shall have an actuarial valuation of the firefighters’ retiree health insurance subsidy trust fund prepared as provided in s. 112.63 by an enrolled actuary, covering the same reporting period or plan year used for the firefighters’ pension plan, and shall submit a report of the valuation, including actuarial assumptions and type and basis of funding, to the division. (b) By February 1 of each year, the trustees shall file a report with the division, containing an independent audit by a certified public accountant if the fund has $250,000 or more in assets, or a certified statement of accounting if the fund has less than $250,000 in assets, for the most recent plan year, showing a detailed listing of assets and methods used to value them and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements shall be reconciled with the assets at the beginning of and end of the year. (c) The trustees may adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this section. (d) At the discretion of the plan sponsor, the cost of administration may be appropriated from the trust fund or paid directly by the plan sponsor.

A year is 12 consecutive months or such other consecutive period of time as is used and consistently applied.(b)A volunteer firefighter means the average salary of the 5 best years of the last 10 best contributing years before change in status to a permanent full-time firefighter or retirement as a volunteer firefighter or the career average of a volunteer firefighter, whichever is greater.(3)“Base premium tax revenues” means:(a)For a local law plan in effect on October 1, 2003, the revenues received by a municipality or special fire control district pursuant to s. 175.121 for the 2002 calendar year.(b)For a local law plan created between October 1, 2003, and March 1, 2015, inclusive, the revenues received by a municipality or special fire control district pursuant to s. 175.121 based upon the tax collections during the second calendar year of participation.(4)“Chapter plan” means a separate defined benefit pension plan for firefighters which incorporates by reference the provisions of this chapter and has been adopted by the governing body of a municipality or special district. Except as specifically authorized in this chapter, the provisions of a chapter plan may not differ from the plan provisions set forth in ss. 175.021-175.341 and ss. 175.361-175.401. Actuarial valuations of chapter plans shall be conducted by the division as provided by s. 175.261(1).(5)“Compensation” or “salary” means, for noncollectively bargained service earned before July 1, 2011, or for service earned under collective bargaining agreements in place before July 1, 2011, the fixed monthly remuneration paid a firefighter. If remuneration is based on actual services rendered, as in the case of a volunteer firefighter, the term means the total cash remuneration received yearly for such services, prorated on a monthly basis. For noncollectively bargained service earned on or after July 1, 2011, or for service earned under collective bargaining agreements entered into on or after July 1, 2011, the term has the same meaning except that when calculating retirement benefits, up to 300 hours per year in overtime compensation may be included as specified in the plan or collective bargaining agreement, but payments for accrued unused sick or annual leave may not be included.(a)Any retirement trust fund or plan that meets the requirements of this chapter does not, solely by virtue of this subsection, reduce or diminish the monthly retirement income otherwise payable to each firefighter covered by the retirement trust fund or plan.(b)The member’s compensation or salary contributed as employee-elective salary reductions or deferrals to any salary reduction, deferred compensation, or tax-sheltered annuity program authorized under the Internal Revenue Code shall be deemed to be the compensation or salary the member would receive if he or she were not participating in such program and shall be treated as compensation for retirement purposes under this chapter.(c)For any person who first becomes a member in any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1996, compensation for that plan year may not include any amounts in excess of the Internal Revenue Code s. 401(a)(17) limitation, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which limitation of $150,000 shall be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and further adjusted for changes in the cost of living in the manner provided by Internal Revenue Code s. 401(a)(17)(B). For any person who first became a member before the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the limitation on compensation may not be less than the maximum compensation amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan in effect on July 1, 1993, which limitation shall be adjusted for changes in the cost of living since 1989 in the manner provided by Internal Revenue Code s. 401(a)(17)(1991).(6)“Creditable service” or “credited service” means the aggregate number of years of service and fractional parts of years of service of any firefighter, omitting intervening years and fractional parts of years when such firefighter may not have been employed by the municipality or special fire control district, subject to the following conditions:(a)A firefighter may not receive credit for years or fractional parts of years of service if he or she has withdrawn his or her contributions to the fund for those years or fractional parts of years of service, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the amount he or she has withdrawn, plus interest determined by the board. The member has at least 90 days after his or her reemployment to make repayment.(b)A firefighter may voluntarily leave his or her contributions in the fund for 5 years after leaving the employ of the fire department, pending the possibility of being rehired by the same department, without losing credit for the time he or she has participated actively as a firefighter. If the firefighter is not reemployed as a firefighter with the same department within 5 years, his or her contributions shall be returned without interest.(c)Credited service under this chapter shall be provided only for service as a firefighter or for military service and does not include credit for any other type of service. A municipality, by local ordinance, or a special fire control district, by resolution, may provide for the purchase of credit for military service prior to employment as well as for prior service as a firefighter for some other employer as long as a firefighter is not entitled to receive a benefit for such prior service. For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a firefighter, in addition to service as a firefighter in this state, credit may be given for federal, other state, or county service if the prior service is recognized by the Division of State Fire Marshal as provided in chapter 633, or the firefighter provides proof to the board of trustees that his or her service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a firefighter.(d)In determining the creditable service of any firefighter, credit for up to 5 years of the time spent in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be added to the years of actual service if:1.The firefighter is in the active employ of an employer immediately before such service and leaves a position, other than a temporary position, for the purpose of voluntary or involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States.2.The firefighter is entitled to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.3.The firefighter returns to his or her employment as a firefighter of the municipality or special fire control district within 1 year after the date of release from such active service.(7)“Deferred Retirement Option Plan” or “DROP” means a local law plan retirement option in which a firefighter may elect to participate.

The retirement benefits, if any, of the defined contribution plan component shall be provided through individual member accounts in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and are limited to the contributions, if any, made into each member’s account and the actual accumulated earnings, net of expenses, earned on the member’s account.(9)“Division” means the Division of Retirement of the Department of Management Services.(10)“Enrolled actuary” means an actuary who is enrolled under Subtitle C of Title III of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and who is a member of the Society of Actuaries or the American Academy of Actuaries.(11)(a)“Firefighter” means a person employed solely by a constituted fire department of any municipality or special fire control district who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with s. 633.408 and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life, or to protect property. The term includes all certified, supervisory, and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time firefighters, part-time firefighters, or auxiliary firefighters but does not include part-time firefighters or auxiliary firefighters. However, for purposes of this chapter only, the term also includes public safety officers who are responsible for performing both police and fire services, who are certified as police officers or firefighters, and who are certified by their employers to the Chief Financial Officer as participating in this chapter before October 1, 1979. Effective October 1, 1979, public safety officers who have not been certified as participating in this chapter are considered police officers for retirement purposes and are eligible to participate in chapter 185. Any plan may provide that the fire chief has an option to participate in that plan.(b)“Volunteer firefighter” means any person whose name is carried on the active membership roll of a constituted volunteer fire department or a combination of a paid and volunteer fire department of any municipality or special fire control district and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life, and to protect property. Compensation for services rendered by a volunteer firefighter does not disqualify him or her as a volunteer. A person may not be disqualified as a volunteer firefighter solely because he or she has other gainful employment. Any person who volunteers assistance at a fire but is not an active member of a department described herein is not a volunteer firefighter within the meaning of this paragraph.(12)“Firefighters’ Pension Trust Fund” means a trust fund, by whatever name known, as provided under s. 175.041, for the purpose of assisting municipalities and special fire control districts in establishing and maintaining a retirement plan for firefighters.(13)“Local law municipality” means any municipality in which a local law plan exists.(14)“Local law plan” means a retirement plan that includes both a defined benefit plan component and a defined contribution plan component for firefighters, or for firefighters and police officers if both are included, as described in s. 175.351, established by municipal ordinance, special district resolution, or special act of the Legislature, which enactment sets forth all plan provisions.

Actuarial valuations of local law plans shall be conducted by an enrolled actuary as provided in s. 175.261(2).(15)“Local law special fire control district” means any special fire control district in which a local law plan exists.(16)“Minimum benefits” means the benefits specified in ss. 175.021-175.341 and ss. 175.361-175.401.(17)“Minimum standards” means the standards specified in ss. 175.021-175.401.(18)“Property insurance” means property insurance as defined in s. 624.604 and covers real and personal property within the corporate limits of a municipality, or within the boundaries of a special fire control district, within the state. The term “multiple peril” means a combination or package policy that includes both property and casualty coverage for a single premium.(19)“Retiree” or “retired firefighter” means a firefighter who has entered retirement status. For the purposes of a plan that includes a Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), a firefighter who enters the DROP is considered a retiree for all purposes of the plan. However, a firefighter who enters the DROP and who is otherwise eligible to participate may not be precluded from participation or continued participation in a supplemental plan in existence on, or created after, March 12, 1999.(20)“Retirement” means a firefighter’s separation from municipal or fire district employment as a firefighter with immediate eligibility for benefits under the plan.
