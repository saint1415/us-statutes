D. 1845, as remains unsold, and the proceeds of the sales of such lands heretofore sold as now remain on hand and unappropriated, and all proceeds that may hereafter accrue from the sales of such lands; and all the swampland or lands subject to overflow granted this state by an Act of Congress approved September 28, A. D. 1850, together with all the proceeds that have accrued or may hereafter accrue to the state from the sale of such lands, are set apart, and declared a separate and distinct fund called the Internal Improvement Trust Fund of the state, and are to be strictly applied according to the provisions of this chapter. (b) All revenues received from application fees charged by the Division of State Lands for the use in any manner, lease, conveyance, or release of any interest in or for the sale of state lands, except revenues from such fees charged by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for aquaculture leases under ss. 253.71(2) and 597.010, must be deposited into the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The fees charged by the division for reproduction of records relating to state lands must also be placed into the fund. Revenues received by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for aquaculture leases under ss. 253.71(2) and 597.010 shall be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (c) Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, if title to any state-owned lands is vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and the lands are located within the Everglades Agricultural Area, then all proceeds from the sale of any such lands shall be deposited into the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to those lands acquired pursuant to s. 607.0505 and former s. 620.192 or chapter 895. (2) All revenues accruing from sources designated by law for deposit in the Internal Improvement Trust Fund shall be used for the acquisition, management, administration, protection, and conservation of state-owned lands.

      "text": "253.02 Board of trustees; powers and duties.— (1) For the purpose of assuring the proper application of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and the Land Acquisition Trust Fund for the purposes of this chapter, the land provided for in ss. 253.01 and 253.03, and all the funds arising from the sale thereof, after paying the necessary expense of selection, management, and sale, are irrevocably vested in a board of four trustees, to wit: The Governor, the Attorney General, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Commissioner of Agriculture and their successors in office, to hold the same in trust for the uses and purposes provided in this chapter, with the power to sell and transfer said lands to the purchasers and receive the power to sell and transfer said lands to the purchasers and receive payment for the same, and invest the surplus moneys arising therefrom, from time to time, in stocks of the United States, stocks of the several states, or the internal improvement bonds issued under the provisions of law; also, the surplus interest accruing from such investments. Said board of trustees has all the rights, powers, property, claims, remedies, actions, suits, and things whatsoever belonging to them, or appertaining before and at the time of the enactment hereof, and they shall remain subject to and pay, fulfill, perform, and discharge all debts, duties, and obligations of their trust, existing at the time of the enactment hereof or provided in this chapter. (2)(a) The board of trustees shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any lands the title to which is vested in the board of trustees except by vote of at least three of the four trustees. (b) The authority of the board of trustees to grant easements for rights-of-way over, across, and upon uplands the title to which is vested in the board of trustees for the construction and operation of electric transmission and distribution facilities and related appurtenances is hereby confirmed. The board of trustees may delegate to the Secretary of Environmental Protection the authority to grant such easements on its behalf. All easements for rights-of-way over, across, and upon uplands the title to which is vested in the board of trustees for the construction and operation of electric transmission and distribution facilities and related appurtenances which are approved by the Secretary of Environmental Protection pursuant to the authority delegated by the board of trustees shall meet the following criteria: 1. Such easements shall not prevent the use of the state-owned uplands adjacent to the easement area for the purposes for which such lands were acquired and shall not unreasonably diminish the ecological, conservation, or recreational values of the state-owned uplands adjacent to the easement area. 2. There is no practical and prudent alternative to locating the linear facility and related appurtenances on state-owned upland. For purposes of this subparagraph, the test of practicality and prudence shall compare the social, economic, and environmental effects of the alternatives. 3. Appropriate steps are taken to minimize the impacts to state-owned uplands. Such steps may include: a. Siting of facilities so as to reduce impacts and minimize fragmentation of the overall state-owned parcel; b. Avoiding significant wildlife habitat, wetlands, or other valuable natural resources to the maximum extent practicable; or c. Avoiding interference with active land management practices, such as prescribed burning. 4. Except for easements granted as a part of a land exchange to accomplish a recreational or conservation benefit or other public purpose, in exchange for such easements, the grantee pays an amount equal to the market value of the interest acquired. In addition, for the initial grant of such easements only, the grantee shall provide additional compensation by vesting in the board of trustees fee simple title to other available uplands that are 1.5 times the size of the easement acquired by the grantee. The Secretary of Environmental Protection shall approve the property to be acquired on behalf of the board of trustees based on the geographic location in relation to the land proposed to be under easement and a determination that economic, ecological, and recreational value is at least equivalent to the value of the lands under proposed easement. Priority for replacement uplands shall be given to parcels identified as inholdings and additions to public lands and lands on a Florida Forever land acquisition list. However, if suitable replacement uplands cannot be identified, the grantee shall provide additional compensation for the initial grant of such easements only by paying to the lead manager of the state-owned lands or, when there is no lead manager, by paying to the department an amount equal to two times the current market value of the state-owned land or the highest and best use value at the time of purchase, whichever is greater. When determining such use of funds, priority shall be given to parcels identified as inholdings and additions to public lands and lands on a Florida Forever land acquisition list. (c) Where authority to approve easements for rights-of-way over, across, and upon uplands the title to which is vested in the board of trustees for the construction and operation of electric transmission and distribution facilities and related appurtenances has not been delegated to the Secretary of Environmental Protection, the board of trustees shall apply the same criteria and require the same compensation as provided above, provided, however, the board of trustees shall have the discretion to determine the amount of replacement lands required within a range of from one to two times the size of the easement acquired by the grantee, depending upon the degree to which the proposed use of the easement will interfere with the manner in which the lands within the proposed easement area have historically been managed. (3) In the event submerged tidal land is to be sold and transferred by said board of trustees, the board of trustees shall first require the Department of Environmental Protection to inspect said lands and to file a written report with the board of trustees which report shall state whether or not the development of said lands would be detrimental to established conservation practices. (4) The board of trustees is authorized to acquire by condemnation such submerged lands, except Murphy Act Lands and Holland Act Lands, as shall be in the public interest and for a public purpose. (5) The board of trustees shall be a necessary party to any action or petition which seeks to acquire submerged lands or lands lying beneath any navigable waters in the state through eminent domain proceedings. (6) The board of trustees shall report to the Legislature its recommendations as to whether any existing multistate compact for mutual aid should be modified or whether the state should enter into a new multistate compact to address the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon event or potentially similar future incidents. The report shall be submitted to the Legislature by February 1, 2012, and updated annually thereafter for 5 years.

      "text": "253.025 Acquisition of state lands.— (1)(a) The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund or its duly authorized agent may not commit the state, through any instrument of negotiated contract or agreement for purchase, to the purchase of lands with or without appurtenances unless this section has been fully complied with. (b) Except for the requirements of subsections (4), (11), and (22), if the public’s interest is reasonably protected, the board of trustees may: 1. Waive any requirements of this section. 2. Waive any rules adopted pursuant to this section, notwithstanding chapter 120. 3. Substitute other reasonably prudent procedures. (c) The board of trustees may also substitute federally mandated acquisition procedures for the provisions of this section if federal funds are available and will be used for the purchase of lands, title to which will vest in the board of trustees, and qualification for such federal funds requires compliance with federally mandated acquisition procedures. (d) Notwithstanding this section, if lands are being acquired by the board of trustees for the anticipated sale, conveyance, or transfer to the Federal Government pursuant to a joint state and federal acquisition project, the board of trustees may use appraisals obtained by the Federal Government in the acquisition of such lands. The board of trustees may waive any provision of this section when land is being conveyed from a state agency to the board. (e) The title to lands acquired pursuant to this section shall vest in the board of trustees pursuant to s. 253.03(1) unless otherwise provided by law, and all such titled lands shall be administered pursuant to s. 253.03. (2) Before any state agency initiates any land acquisition, except for the purchase of property for transportation facilities and transportation corridors and property for borrow pits for road building purposes, the agency shall coordinate with the Division of State Lands to determine the availability of existing, suitable state-owned lands in the area and the public purpose for which the acquisition is being proposed. If the state agency determines that no suitable state-owned lands exist, the state agency may proceed to acquire such lands by employing all available statutory authority for acquisition. (3) The board of trustees is authorized to adopt rules to implement this section, including rules governing the terms and conditions of land purchases. The rules shall address, with specificity, but need not be limited to: (a) The procedures to be followed in the acquisition process, including selection of appraisers, surveyors, title agents, and closing agents, and the content of appraisal reports. (b) The determination of the value of parcels which the state has an interest in acquiring. (c) Special requirements when multiple landowners are involved in an acquisition. (d) Requirements for obtaining written option agreements so that the interests of the state are fully protected. (4) An agreement to acquire real property for the purposes described in this chapter, chapter 259, chapter 260, or chapter 375, title to which will vest in the board of trustees, may not bind the state before the agreement is reviewed and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection as complying with this section and any rules adopted pursuant to this section. If any of the following conditions exist, the agreement must be submitted to and approved by the board of trustees: (a) The purchase price agreed to by the seller exceeds the value as established pursuant to the rules of the board of trustees. (b) The contract price agreed to by the seller and the acquiring agency exceeds $5 million. (c) Other conditions that the board of trustees may adopt by rule. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, Florida Forever projects when title to the property being acquired is considered nonmarketable or is encumbered in such a way as to significantly affect its management. If approval of the board of trustees is required pursuant to this subsection, the acquiring agency must provide a justification as to why it is in the public’s interest to acquire the parcel or Florida Forever project. Approval of the board of trustees is also required for Florida Forever projects the department recommends acquiring pursuant to subsections (11) and (22). Review and approval of agreements for acquisitions for Florida Greenways and Trails Program properties pursuant to chapter 260 may be waived by the department in any contract with nonprofit corporations that have agreed to assist the department with this program. If the contribution of the acquiring agency exceeds $100 million in any one fiscal year, the agreement must be submitted to and approved by the Legislative Budget Commission. (5) Land acquisition procedures provided for in this section are for voluntary, negotiated acquisitions. (6) For the purposes of this section, the term “negotiations” does not include preliminary contacts with the property owner to determine the availability of the property, existing appraisal data, existing abstracts, and surveys. (7) Evidence of marketable title shall be provided by the landowner before the conveyance of title, as provided in the final agreement for purchase. Such evidence of marketability shall be in the form of title insurance or an abstract of title with a title opinion. The board of trustees may waive the requirement that the landowner provide evidence of marketable title, and, in such case, the acquiring agency shall provide evidence of marketable title. The board of trustees or its designee may waive the requirement of evidence of marketability for acquisitions of property assessed by the county property appraiser at $10,000 or less, if the Division of State Lands finds, based upon such review of the title records as is reasonable under the circumstances, that there is no apparent impediment to marketability, or to management of the property by the state. (8) Before approval by the board of trustees, or, when applicable, the Department of Environmental Protection, of any agreement to purchase land pursuant to this chapter, chapter 259, chapter 260, or chapter 375, and before negotiations with the parcel owner to purchase any other land, title to which will vest in the board of trustees, an appraisal of the parcel shall be required as follows: (a) The board of trustees shall adopt by rule the method for determining the value of parcels sought to be acquired by state agencies pursuant to this section. (b) Each parcel to be acquired must have at least one appraisal. Two appraisals are required when the estimated value of the parcel exceeds $5 million. However, if both appraisals exceed $5 million and differ significantly, a third appraisal may be obtained. If a parcel is estimated to be worth $100,000 or less and the director of the Division of State Lands finds that the cost of an outside appraisal is not justified, a comparable sales analysis, an appraisal prepared by the division, or other reasonably prudent procedures may be used by the division to estimate the value of the parcel, provided the public’s interest is reasonably protected. The state is not required to appraise the value of lands and appurtenances that are being donated to the state. (c) Appraisal fees and associated costs shall be paid by the agency proposing the acquisition. All appraisals used for the acquisition of lands pursuant to this section shall be prepared by a state-certified appraiser. The board of trustees shall adopt rules for selecting individuals to perform appraisals pursuant to this section. Each fee appraiser selected to appraise a particular parcel shall, before contracting with the agency or a participant in a multiparty agreement, submit to the agency an affidavit substantiating that he or she has no vested or fiduciary interest in such parcel. (d) The fee appraiser and the review appraiser for the agency may not act in any manner that may be construed as negotiating with the owner of a parcel proposed for acquisition. (e) The board of trustees shall adopt by rule the minimum criteria, techniques, and methods to be used in the preparation of appraisal reports. Such rules shall incorporate, to the extent practicable, generally accepted appraisal standards. Any appraisal issued for acquisition of lands pursuant to this section must comply with the rules adopted by the board of trustees. A certified survey must be made which meets the minimum requirements for upland parcels established in the Standards of Practice for Land Surveying in Florida published by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and which accurately portrays, to the greatest extent practicable, the condition of the parcel as it currently exists. The requirement for a certified survey may, in part or in whole, be waived by the board of trustees any time before submitting the agreement for purchase to the Division of State Lands. When an existing boundary map and description of a parcel are determined by the division to be sufficient for appraisal purposes, the division director may temporarily waive the requirement for a survey until any time before conveyance of title to the parcel. (f) Appraisal reports are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), for use by the agency and the board of trustees, until an option contract is executed or, if no option contract is executed, until 2 weeks before a contract or agreement for purchase is considered for approval by the board of trustees. However, the Department of Environmental Protection shall disclose appraisal reports to private landowners or their representatives during negotiations for acquisitions. The department may also disclose appraisal information to public agencies or nonprofit organizations that agree to maintain the confidentiality of the reports or information when joint acquisition of property is contemplated, or when a public agency or nonprofit organization enters into a written agreement with the department to purchase and hold property for subsequent resale to the board of trustees. In addition, the department may use, as its own, appraisals obtained by a public agency or nonprofit organization, if the appraiser is selected from the department’s list of appraisers and the appraisal is reviewed and approved by the department. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “nonprofit organization” means an organization that is exempt from federal income tax under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and, for purposes of the acquisition of conservation lands, an organization whose purpose must include the preservation of natural resources. The agency may release an appraisal report when the passage of time has rendered the conclusions of value in the report invalid or when the acquiring agency has terminated negotiations. (g) Before acceptance of an appraisal, the agency shall submit a copy of such report to the division. The division shall review such report for compliance with the rules of the board. Any questions of applicability of laws affecting an appraisal shall be addressed by the legal office of the agency. (h) The appraisal report shall be accompanied by the sales history of the parcel for at least the previous 5 years. Such sales history shall include all parties and considerations with the amount of consideration verified, if possible. If a sales history would not be useful, or it is cost prohibitive compared to the value of a parcel, the sales history may be waived by the board of trustees. The board of trustees shall adopt a rule specifying guidelines for waiver of a sales history. (i) The board of trustees may consider an appraisal acquired by a seller, or any part thereof, in negotiating to purchase a parcel, but such appraisal may not be used in lieu of an appraisal required by this subsection or to determine the maximum offer allowed by law. (j)1. The board of trustees shall adopt by rule the method for determining the value of parcels sought to be acquired by state agencies pursuant to this section. An offer by a state agency may not exceed the value for that parcel as determined pursuant to the highest approved appraisal or the value determined pursuant to the rules of the board of trustees, whichever value is less. 2. The board of trustees or, when applicable, the Department of Environmental Protection may acquire parcels pursuant to this chapter and chapter 259 for the full value of that parcel as determined pursuant to the highest approved appraisal. 3. For a joint acquisition by a state agency and a local government or other entity apart from the state, the joint purchase price may not exceed 150 percent of the value for a parcel as determined in accordance with the limits in subparagraph 1. The state agency share of a joint purchase offer may not exceed what the agency may offer singly pursuant to subparagraph 1. 4. This paragraph does not apply to the acquisition of historically unique or significant property as determined by the Division of Historical Resources of the Department of State. Notwithstanding this subsection, on behalf of the board of trustees and before the appraisal of parcels approved for purchase under this chapter or chapter 259, the Secretary of Environmental Protection or the director of the Division of State Lands may enter into option contracts to buy such parcels. Any such option contract shall state that the final purchase price is subject to approval by the board of trustees or, if applicable, the Secretary of Environmental Protection, and that the final purchase price may not exceed the maximum offer allowed by law. Any such option contract presented to the board of trustees for final purchase price approval shall explicitly state that payment of the final purchase price is subject to an appropriation from the Legislature. The consideration for such an option may not exceed $1,000 or 0.01 percent of the estimate by the department of the value of the parcel, whichever amount is greater. (9)(a) When the owner is represented by an agent or broker, negotiations may not be initiated or continued until a written statement verifying such agent’s or broker’s legal or fiduciary relationship with the owner is on file with the agency. (b) The board of trustees or any state agency may contract for real estate acquisition services, including, but not limited to, contracts for real estate commission fees, surveying, mapping, environmental audits, title work, and legal and other professional assistance to review acquisition agreements and other documents and to perform acquisition closings. However, the Department of Environmental Protection may use outside counsel to review any agreements or documents or to perform acquisition closings unless department staff can conduct the same activity in 15 days or less. (c) Upon the initiation of negotiations, the state agency shall inform the owner in writing that all agreements for purchase are subject to approval by the board of trustees. (d) All offers or counteroffers shall be documented in writing and shall be confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) until an option contract is executed, or if no option contract is executed, until 2 weeks before a contract or agreement for purchase is considered for approval by the board of trustees. The agency shall maintain complete and accurate records of all offers and counteroffers for all projects. (e) When making an offer to a landowner, a state agency shall consider the desirability of a single cash payment in relation to the maximum offer allowed by law. (f) The state shall have the authority to reimburse the owner for the cost of the survey when deemed appropriate. The reimbursement is not considered a part of the purchase price. (g) A final offer shall be in the form of an option contract or agreement for purchase and shall be signed and attested to by the owner and the representative of the agency. Before the agency executes the option contract or agreement for purchase, the contract or agreement shall be reviewed for form and legality by legal staff of the agency. Before the agency signs the agreement for purchase or exercises the option contract, the provisions of s. 286.23 shall be complied with. Within 10 days after the signing of the agreement for purchase, the state agency shall furnish the Department of Environmental Protection with the original of the agreement for purchase along with copies of the disclosure notice, evidence of marketability, the accepted appraisal report, the fee appraiser’s affidavit, a statement that the inventory of existing state-owned lands was examined and contained no available suitable land in the area, and a statement outlining the public purpose for which the acquisition is being made and the statutory authority therefor. (h) Within 45 days after receipt by the Department of Environmental Protection of the agreement for purchase and the required documentation, the board of trustees or, if the purchase price does not exceed $100,000, its designee shall reject or approve the agreement. An approved agreement for purchase is binding on both parties. Any agreement which has been disapproved shall be returned to the agency, along with a statement as to the deficiencies of the agreement or the supporting documentation. An agreement for purchase which has been disapproved by the board of trustees may be resubmitted when such deficiencies have been corrected. (10)(a) A dedication, gift, grant, or bequest of lands and appurtenances may not be accepted by the board of trustees until the receiving state agency supplies sufficient evidence of marketability of title. The board of trustees may not accept by dedication, gift, grant, or bequest any lands and appurtenances that are determined as being owned by the state in fee or by virtue of the state’s sovereignty or which are so encumbered so as to preclude the use of such lands and appurtenances for any reasonable public purpose. The board of trustees may accept a dedication, gift, grant, or bequest of lands and appurtenances without formal evidence of marketability, or when the title is nonmarketable, if the board or its designee determines that such lands and appurtenances have value and are reasonably manageable by the state, and that their acceptance would serve the public interest. The state is not required to appraise the value of such donated lands and appurtenances as a condition of receipt. (b) A deed filed in the public records to donate lands to the board of trustees does not transfer title to or vest title in the board of trustees unless a document indicating that the board of trustees has agreed to accept the transfer of title to such donated lands is also filed in the public records. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the maximum value of a parcel to be purchased by the board of trustees as determined by the highest approved appraisal or as determined pursuant to the rules of the board of trustees may not be increased or decreased as a result of a change in zoning or permitted land uses, or changes in market forces or prices that occur within 1 year after the date the Department of Environmental Protection or the board of trustees approves a contract to purchase the parcel. (11) Notwithstanding this section, the board of trustees, by an affirmative vote of at least three members, voting at a regularly scheduled and advertised meeting, may direct the Department of Environmental Protection to exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to chapters 73 and 74 to acquire any conservation parcel identified on the acquisition list established by the Acquisition and Restoration Council and approved by the board of trustees pursuant to chapter 259. However, the board of trustees may only make such a vote under the following circumstances: (a) The state has made at least two bona fide offers to purchase the land through negotiation and, notwithstanding those offers, an impasse between the state and the landowner was reached. (b) The land is of special importance to the state because of one or more of the following reasons: 1. It involves an endangered or natural resource and is in imminent danger of development. 2. It is of unique value to the state and the failure to acquire it will result in irreparable loss to the state. 3. The failure of the state to acquire it will seriously impair the state’s ability to manage or protect other state-owned lands. Pursuant to this subsection, the department may exercise condemnation authority directly or by contracting with the Department of Transportation or a water management district to provide that service. If the Department of Transportation or a water management district enters into such a contract with the department, the Department of Transportation or a water management district may use statutorily approved methods and procedures ordinarily used by the agency for condemnation purposes. (12) Any conveyance to the board of trustees of fee title shall be made by no less than a special warranty deed, unless the conveyance is from the Federal Government, the county government, or another state agency or, in the event of a gift or donation by quitclaim deed, if the board of trustees, or its designee, determines that the acceptance of such quitclaim deed is in the best interest of the public. A quitclaim deed may also be accepted to aid in clearing title or boundary questions. (13) The board of trustees may purchase tax certificates or tax deeds issued in accordance with chapter 197 relating to property eligible for purchase under this section. (14) The Auditor General shall conduct audits of acquisitions and divestitures which, according to his or her preliminary assessments of board-approved acquisitions and divestitures, he or she deems necessary. These preliminary assessments shall be initiated not later than 60 days after the board of trustees’ final approval of land acquisitions under this section. If an audit is conducted, the Auditor General shall submit an audit report to the board of trustees, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and their designees. (15) The board of trustees and all affected agencies shall adopt and may modify or repeal such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out this section, including rules governing the terms and conditions of land purchases. Such rules shall address the procedures to be followed, when multiple landowners are involved in an acquisition, in obtaining written option agreements so that the interests of the state are fully protected. (16)(a) The board of trustees may deed property to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, so that the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is able to sell, convey, transfer, exchange, trade, or purchase land on which a forestry facility resides for money or other more suitable property on which to relocate the facility. Any sale or purchase of property by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall follow the requirements of subsections (7)-(10) and (12). Any sale shall be at fair market value, and any trade shall ensure that the state is getting at least an equal value for the property. Except as provided in subsections (7)-(10) and (12), the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is excluded from following the provisions of this chapter and chapters 259 and 375. This exclusion does not apply to lands acquired for conservation purposes in accordance with s. 253.0341(1) or (2). (b) In the case of a sale by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services of a forestry facility, the proceeds of the sale shall be deposited into the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Incidental Trust Fund. The Legislature may, at the request of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, appropriate such money within the trust fund to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for purchase of land and construction of a facility to replace the disposed facility. All proceeds other than land from any sale, conveyance, exchange, trade, or transfer conducted pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Incidental Trust Fund. (c) Additional funds may be added from time to time by the Legislature to further the relocation and construction of forestry facilities. If an equal trade of land occurs, money from the trust fund may be appropriated for building construction even though no money was received from the trade. (17) Any agency that acquires land on behalf of the board of trustees is authorized to request disbursement of payments for real estate closings in accordance with a written authorization from an ultimate beneficiary to allow a third party authorized by law to receive such payment provided the Chief Financial Officer determines that such disbursement is consistent with good business practices and can be completed in a manner minimizing costs and risks to the state. (18) Pursuant to s. 944.10, the Department of Corrections is responsible for obtaining appraisals and entering into option agreements and agreements for the purchase of state correctional facility sites. An option agreement or agreement for purchase is not binding upon the state until it is approved by the board of trustees. The provisions of paragraphs (8)(c), (e), and (f) and (9)(b), (c), and (d) apply to all appraisals, offers, and counteroffers of the Department of Corrections for state correctional facility sites. (19) Many parcels of land acquired pursuant to this section may contain cattle-dipping vats as defined in s. 376.301. The state is encouraged to continue with the acquisition of such lands, including any cattle-dipping vats. (20) Pursuant to s. 985.682, the Department of Juvenile Justice is responsible for obtaining appraisals and entering into option agreements and agreements for the purchase of state juvenile justice facility sites. An option agreement or agreement for purchase is not binding upon the state until it is approved by the board of trustees. The provisions of paragraphs (8)(c), (e), and (f) and (9)(b), (c), and (d) apply to all appraisals, offers, and counteroffers of the Department of Juvenile Justice for state juvenile justice facility sites. (21)(a) The board of trustees may acquire, pursuant to s. 288.980(2)(b), nonconservation lands from the annual list submitted by the Department of Commerce for the purpose of buffering a military installation against encroachment. (b) If federal partnership funds are available before the military installation buffer land is acquired, the Division of State Lands shall apply yellow book appraisal standards and must disclose the appraised value to the seller. (c) Following acquisition of the military installation buffer land, the board of trustees is authorized, in accordance with the installation’s procedures, the laws of this state, and the terms of the management and monitoring agreement provided in s. 288.980(2)(b), to: 1. Convey the land at less than appraised value to the military installation; 2. Lease the land at less than appraised or market value to the military installation; or 3. Lease the land at rates determined by competitive bid, which may be less than appraised or market value, to private entities to conduct agricultural or silvicultural operations under terms requiring approval of the military installation and that must implement the best management practices applicable to such operations as adopted by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (d) A conveyance at less than appraised value must state that the land will revert to the board of trustees if the land is not used for its intended purposes as a military installation buffer or if the military installation closes. (22) The board of trustees, by an affirmative vote of at least three members, may direct the Department of Environmental Protection to purchase lands on an immediate basis using up to 15 percent of the funds allocated to the department pursuant to s. 259.105 for the acquisition of lands that: (a) Are listed or placed at auction by the Federal Government as part of the Resolution Trust Corporation sale of lands from failed savings and loan associations; (b) Are listed or placed at auction by the Federal Government as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sale of lands from failed banks; (c) Will be developed or otherwise lost to potential public ownership, or for which federal matching funds will be lost, by the time the land can be purchased under the program within which the land is listed for acquisition; or (d) Will prevent or satisfy private property rights claims resulting from limitations imposed by the designation of an area of critical state concern pursuant to chapter 380. Lands acquired pursuant to this subsection must, at the time of purchase, be on one of the acquisition lists established pursuant to chapter 259, or be essential for water resource development, protection, or restoration, or a significant portion of the lands must contain natural communities or plant or animal species that are listed by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory as critically imperiled, imperiled, or rare, or as excellent quality occurrences of natural communities. (23) The board of trustees, by an affirmative vote of at least three members, may direct the division to purchase lands on an immediate basis that will prevent or satisfy private property rights claims resulting from limitations imposed by the designation of an area of critical state concern pursuant to chapter 380. (24) For acquisitions directed pursuant to subsection (22) or subsection (23): (a) The board of trustees may waive or modify all procedures required for land acquisition pursuant to this chapter and all competitive bid procedures required pursuant to chapters 255 and 287; and (b) If a parcel is estimated to be worth $500,000 or less and the director of the Division of State Lands finds that the cost of an outside appraisal is not justified, a comparable sales analysis, an appraisal prepared by the division, or other reasonably prudent procedure may be used by the division to estimate the value of the land, provided the public interest is reasonably protected. (25) Title to lands to be held jointly by the board of trustees and a water management district and acquired pursuant to s. 373.139 may be deemed to meet the standards necessary for ownership by the board of trustees, notwithstanding this section or related rules.

      "heading": "Alternatives to fee simple acquisition.",
      "text": "253.0251 Alternatives to fee simple acquisition.— (1) The Legislature finds that: (a) With the increasing pressures on the natural areas of this state and on open space suitable for recreational use, the state must develop creative techniques to maximize the use of acquisition and management funds. (b) The state’s conservation and recreational land acquisition agencies should be encouraged to augment their traditional, fee simple acquisition programs with the use of alternatives to fee simple acquisition techniques. In addition, the Legislature finds that generations of private landowners have been good stewards of their land, protecting or restoring native habitats and ecosystems to the benefit of the natural resources of this state, its heritage, and its citizens. The Legislature also finds that using alternatives to fee simple acquisition by public land acquisition agencies will achieve the following public policy goals: 1. Allow more lands to be brought under public protection for preservation, conservation, and recreational purposes with less expenditure of public funds. 2. Retain, on local government tax rolls, some portion of or interest in lands which are under public protection. 3. Reduce long-term management costs by allowing private property owners to continue acting as stewards of their land, when appropriate. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that public land acquisition agencies develop programs to pursue alternatives to fee simple acquisition and to educate private landowners about such alternatives and the benefits of such alternatives. It is also the intent of the Legislature that a portion of the shares of Florida Forever bond proceeds be used to purchase eligible properties using alternatives to fee simple acquisition. (2) All applications for full fee simple acquisition projects must identify, within their acquisition plans, the reasons the projects require a full fee simple interest to achieve the public policy goals, together with the reasons full title is determined to be necessary. The state agencies and the water management districts may use alternatives to fee simple acquisition to bring the remaining projects in their acquisition plans under public protection. For purposes of this section, the phrase “alternatives to fee simple acquisition” includes, but is not limited to, purchase of development rights; obtaining conservation easements; obtaining flowage easements; purchase of timber rights, mineral rights, or hunting rights; purchase of agricultural interests or silvicultural interests; fee simple acquisitions with reservations; creating life estates; or any other acquisition technique that achieves the public policy goals listed in subsection (1). It is presumed that a private landowner retains the full range of uses for all the rights or interests in the landowner’s land which are not specifically acquired by the public agency. The lands upon which hunting rights are specifically acquired pursuant to this section shall be available for hunting in accordance with the management plan or hunting regulations adopted by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, unless the hunting rights are purchased specifically to protect activities on adjacent lands. (3) When developing the acquisition plan pursuant to s. 259.105, the Acquisition and Restoration Council may give preference to those less than fee simple acquisitions that provide any public access. However, the Legislature recognizes that public access is not always appropriate for certain less than fee simple acquisitions. Therefore, any proposed less than fee simple acquisition may not be rejected simply because public access would be limited. (4) The Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and each water management district shall implement initiatives for using alternatives to fee simple acquisition and to educate private landowners about such alternatives. The Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and the water management districts may enter into joint acquisition agreements to jointly fund the purchase of lands using alternatives to fee simple techniques. (5) The Legislature finds that the lack of direct sales comparison information has served as an impediment to successful implementation of alternatives to fee simple acquisition. It is the intent of the Legislature that, in the absence of direct comparable sales information, appraisals of alternatives to fee simple acquisitions be based on the difference between the full fee simple valuation and the value of the interests remaining with the seller after acquisition. (6) The public agency that has been assigned management responsibility shall inspect and monitor any less than fee simple interest according to the terms of the purchase agreement relating to such interest. (7) For less than fee simple acquisitions pursuant to s. 570.71, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall comply with the acquisition procedures set forth in s. 570.715.

      "text": "253.027 Emergency archaeological property acquisition.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Emergency Archaeological Property Acquisition Act of 1988.” (2) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—It is the intent of the Legislature that a program be established to protect archaeological properties of major statewide significance from destruction as a result of imminent development, vandalism, or natural events. Since these resources are often discovered during excavation as part of construction activities or after storm events, little time may be available for using other, often time-consuming, property acquisition methods. It is, therefore, the further intent of the Legislature to create a rapid method of acquisition for a limited number of specifically designated properties, which method may bypass previously accepted methods of state land acquisition. It is also the intent of the Legislature that lands no longer needed for the purposes expressed in this section be sold and funds returned to their original source for use in other programs. (3) DEFINITION.—“Archaeological property of major statewide significance” means lands that contain unique prehistoric or historic artifacts, relics, or structures of archaeological value that are: (a) Not merely of local or regional significance, but of importance to the state as a whole. (b) Outstanding representations of a particular culture, historic event, or epoch. (4) EMERGENCY ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACQUISITION.—The sum of $2 million shall be reserved annually within the Florida Forever Trust Fund for the purpose of emergency archaeological acquisition. Any portion of that amount not spent or obligated by the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year may be used for approved acquisitions pursuant to s. 259.105(3)(b). (5) ACCOUNT EXPENDITURES.— (a) No moneys shall be spent for the acquisition of any property, including title works, appraisal fees, and survey costs, unless: 1. The property is an archaeological property of major statewide significance. 2. The structures, artifacts, or relics, or their historic significance, will be irretrievably lost if the state cannot acquire the property. 3. The site is presently on an acquisition list for Florida Forever lands or complies with the criteria for inclusion on any such list, but has yet to be included on the list. 4. No other source of immediate funding is available to purchase or otherwise protect the property. 5. The site is not otherwise protected by local, state, or federal laws. 6. The acquisition is not inconsistent with the state comprehensive plan and the state land acquisition program. (b) No moneys shall be spent from the account for excavation or restoration of the properties acquired. Funds may be spent for preliminary surveys to determine if the sites meet the criteria of this section. An amount not to exceed $100,000 may also be spent from the account to inventory and evaluate archaeological and historic resources on properties purchased, or proposed for purchase, pursuant to s. 259.105(3)(b). (6) INITIATION OF PURCHASE.—The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund shall consider the purchase of lands pursuant to this section upon its own motion or upon a written request by any person, corporation, organization, or agency. The request shall contain the following information: (a) The name, address, and phone number of the person making the request. (b) A legal description of the property, or if one is not readily available, a physical description sufficient to identify its general location. (c) The name and address of the owner if it is different from the requester. (d) An indication of the owner’s willingness to sell. (e) A statement showing why the property is in imminent danger of being destroyed or substantially altered and why state acquisition is necessary. (f) A statement showing why the property is archaeological property of major statewide significance that meets the criteria for purchase within the requirements of this section. (g) If archaeological resources are sought to be protected from the result of imminent construction activities, a list of the local, state, or federal laws that might otherwise be available to protect the resource, and a short statement of the reason the laws are not available to protect the resource. The written request shall be filed with the Division of State Lands and the Division of Historical Resources. If the director of either division or the director’s designee finds that the request substantially complies with the requirements of this section, it shall be placed on the next Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund agenda following receipt without the need for notice; provided, however, that each Cabinet officer shall have received copies of the request at least 24 hours before the meeting. Should the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund agree to consider the request, it shall approve a plan for future actions that may lead to acquisition of the property as soon as possible thereafter. (7) ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY.—Property may not be acquired under this section until the disposition or settlement of any litigation involving such property or involving the use of or construction on such property or on adjacent property. Title to property acquired pursuant to this section shall be held by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and managed pursuant to the provisions of s. 259.032. (8) WAIVER OF APPRAISALS OR SURVEYS.—The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund may waive or limit any appraisal or survey requirements in s. 253.025, if necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. Fee simple title is not required to be conveyed if some lesser interest will allow the preservation of the archaeological resource. Properties purchased pursuant to this section shall be considered archaeologically unique or significant properties and may be purchased under the provisions of s. 253.025(9). (9) SEVERABILITY.—If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, it is the legislative intent that the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared severable. (10) LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.—It is intended that the provisions of this section shall be liberally construed for accomplishing the work authorized and provided for or intended to be provided for by this section, and when strict construction would result in the defeat of the accomplishment of any part of the work authorized by this section and a liberal construction would permit or assist in the accomplishment thereof, the liberal construction shall be chosen.

All recipients of Florida Forever funds shall annually submit their records for lands acquired for compilation of state lands records by the department. The program shall include, at a minimum: (a) A document management component to automate the storage and retrieval of information contained in state lands records. (b) A land records management component to organize the records by key elements present in the data. (c) An evaluation component which includes the collection of resource and environmental data. (d) A mapping component to generate and store maps of state-owned parcels using data from the land records management and evaluation components. (2) At all stages of its records modernization program, the department shall seek to ensure information systems compatibility within the department and with other state, local, and regional governmental agencies.

These lands shall be managed to provide for areas of natural resource based recreation, and to ensure the survival of plant and animal species and the conservation of finite and renewable natural resources. The state’s lands and natural resources shall be managed using a stewardship ethic that assures these resources will be available for the benefit and enjoyment of all people of the state, both present and future. It is the intent of the Legislature that, where feasible and consistent with the goals of protection and conservation of natural resources associated with lands held in the public trust by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, public land not designated for single-use purposes pursuant to paragraph (2)(b) be managed for multiple-use purposes. All multiple-use land management strategies shall address public access and enjoyment, resource conservation and protection, ecosystem maintenance and protection, and protection of threatened and endangered species, and the degree to which public-private partnerships or endowments may allow the entity with management responsibility to enhance its ability to manage these lands. The Acquisition and Restoration Council shall recommend rules to the board of trustees, and the board of trustees shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. (2) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Multiple use” means the harmonious and coordinated management of timber, recreation, conservation of fish and wildlife, forage, archaeological and historic sites, habitat and other biological resources, or water resources so that they are used in the combination that will best serve the people of the state, making the most judicious use of the land for some or all of these resources and giving consideration to the relative values of the various resources. Where necessary and appropriate for all state-owned lands that are larger than 1,000 acres in project size and are managed for multiple uses, buffers may be formed around any areas that require special protection or have special management needs. Such buffers may not exceed more than one-half of the total acreage. Multiple uses within a buffer area may be restricted to provide the necessary buffering effect desired. Multiple use in this context includes both uses of land or resources by more than one management entity, which may include private sector land managers. In any case, lands identified as multiple-use lands in the land management plan shall be managed to enhance and conserve the lands and resources for the enjoyment of the people of the state. (b) “Single use” means management for one particular purpose to the exclusion of all other purposes, except that the using entity shall have the option of including in its management program compatible secondary purposes which will not detract from or interfere with the primary management purpose. Such single uses may include, but are not necessarily restricted to, the use of agricultural lands for production of food and livestock, the use of improved sites and grounds for institutional purposes, and the use of lands for parks, preserves, wildlife management, archaeological or historic sites, or wilderness areas where the maintenance of essentially natural conditions is important. All submerged lands shall be considered single-use lands and shall be managed primarily for the maintenance of essentially natural conditions, the propagation of fish and wildlife, and public recreation, including hunting and fishing where deemed appropriate by the managing entity. (c) “Conservation lands” means lands that are currently managed for conservation, outdoor resource-based recreation, or archaeological or historic preservation, except those lands that were acquired solely to facilitate the acquisition of other conservation lands. Lands acquired for uses other than conservation, outdoor resource-based recreation, or archaeological or historic preservation may not be designated conservation lands except as otherwise authorized under this section. These lands shall include, but not be limited to, the following: correction and detention facilities, military installations and facilities, state office buildings, maintenance yards, state university or Florida College System institution campuses, agricultural field stations or offices, tower sites, law enforcement and license facilities, laboratories, hospitals, clinics, and other sites that do not possess significant natural or historical resources. However, lands acquired solely to facilitate the acquisition of other conservation lands, and for which the land management plan has not yet been completed or updated, may be evaluated by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund on a case-by-case basis to determine if they will be designated conservation lands. (d) “Public access,” as used in this chapter and chapter 259, means access by the general public to state lands and water, including vessel access made possible by boat ramps, docks, and associated support facilities, where compatible with conservation and recreation objectives. Lands acquired by the state as a gift, through donation, or by any other conveyance for which no consideration was paid, and which are not managed for conservation, outdoor resource-based recreation, or archaeological or historic preservation under a land management plan approved by the board of trustees are not conservation lands. (3) Recognizing that recreational trails purchased with rails-to-trails funds pursuant to former s. 259.101(3)(g), Florida Statutes 2014, or s. 259.105(3)(h) have had historic transportation uses and that their linear character may extend many miles, the Legislature intends that if the necessity arises to serve public needs, after balancing the need to protect trail users from collisions with automobiles and a preference for the use of overpasses and underpasses to the greatest extent feasible and practical, transportation uses shall be allowed to cross recreational trails purchased pursuant to former s. 259.101(3)(g), Florida Statutes 2014, or s. 259.105(3)(h). When these crossings are needed, the location and design should consider and mitigate the impact on humans and environmental resources, and the value of the land shall be paid based on fair market value. (4) A management agreement, lease, or other instrument authorizing the use of lands owned by the board of trustees may not be executed for a period greater than is necessary to provide for the reasonable use of the land for the existing or planned life cycle or amortization of the improvements, except that an easement in perpetuity may be granted by the board of trustees if the improvement is a transportation facility. If an entity managing or leasing state-owned lands from the board of trustees does not meet the short-term goals under paragraph (5)(b) for conservation lands, the Department of Environmental Protection may submit the lands to the Acquisition and Restoration Council to review whether the short-term goals should be modified, consider whether the lands should be offered to another entity for management or leasing, or recommend to the board of trustees whether to surplus the lands. If an entity managing or leasing state-owned lands from the board of trustees does not meet the short-term goals under paragraph (5)(i) for nonconservation lands, the department may submit the lands to the board of trustees to consider whether to require the managing or leasing entity to release its interest in the lands and to consider whether to surplus the lands. If the state-owned lands are determined to be surplus, the board of trustees may require an entity to release its interest in the lands. An entity managing or leasing state-owned lands from the board of trustees may not sublease such lands without prior review by the Division of State Lands and, for conservation lands, by the Acquisition and Restoration Council. All management agreements, leases, or other instruments authorizing the use of lands owned by the board of trustees shall be reviewed for approval by the board of trustees or its designee. The council is not required to review subleases of parcels which are less than 160 acres in size. 1 (5) Each manager of conservation lands shall submit to the Division of State Lands a land management plan at least every 10 years in a form and manner adopted by rule of the board of trustees and in accordance with s. 259.032. Each manager of conservation lands shall also update a land management plan whenever the manager proposes to add new facilities or make substantive land use or management changes that were not addressed in the approved plan, or within 1 year after the addition of significant new lands. Each manager of nonconservation lands shall submit to the Division of State Lands a land use plan at least every 10 years in a form and manner adopted by rule of the board of trustees. The division shall review each plan for compliance with the requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the rules adopted by the board of trustees pursuant to this section. All nonconservation land use plans, whether for single-use or multiple-use properties, must be managed to provide the greatest benefit to the state. Plans for managed areas larger than 1,000 acres must contain an analysis of the multiple-use potential of the property which includes the potential of the property to generate revenues to enhance the management of the property. In addition, the plan must contain an analysis of the potential use of private land managers to facilitate the restoration or management of these lands and whether nonconservation lands would be more appropriately transferred to the county or municipality in which the land is located for the purpose of providing affordable multifamily rental housing that meets the criteria of s. 420.0004(3). If a newly acquired property has a valid conservation plan that was developed by a soil and water conservation district, such plan must be used to guide management of the property until a formal land use plan is completed. (a) State conservation lands must be managed to ensure the conservation of this state’s plant and animal species and to ensure the accessibility of state lands for the benefit and enjoyment of all people of this state, both present and future. Each land management plan for state conservation lands must provide a desired outcome, describe both short-term and long-term management goals, and include measurable objectives to achieve those goals. Short-term goals must be achievable within a 2-year planning period, and long-term goals must be achievable within a 10-year planning period. These short-term and long-term management goals are the basis for all subsequent land management activities. (b) Short-term and long-term management goals for state conservation lands must include measurable objectives for the following, as appropriate: 1. Habitat restoration and improvement. 2. Public access and recreational opportunities. 3. Hydrological preservation and restoration. 4. Sustainable forest management. 5. Exotic and invasive species maintenance and control. 6. Capital facilities and infrastructure. 7. Cultural and historical resources. 8. Imperiled species habitat maintenance, enhancement, restoration, or population restoration. (c) The land management plan must, at a minimum, contain the following elements: 1. A physical description of the land. 2. A quantitative data description of the land which includes an inventory of forest and other natural resources; exotic and invasive plants; hydrological features; infrastructure, including recreational facilities; and other significant land, cultural, or historical features. The inventory must reflect the number of acres for each resource and feature, when appropriate. The inventory must be of such detail that objective measures and benchmarks can be established for each tract of land and monitored during the lifetime of the plan. All quantitative data collected must be aggregated, standardized, collected, and presented in an electronic format to allow for uniform management reporting and analysis. The information collected by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to s. 253.0325(2) must be available to the land manager and his or her assignee. 3. A detailed description of each short-term and long-term land management goal, the associated measurable objectives, and the related activities that are to be performed to meet the land management objectives. Each land management objective must be addressed by the land management plan, and if practicable, a land management objective may not be performed to the detriment of the other land management objectives. 4. A schedule of land management activities which contains short-term and long-term land management goals and the related measurable objective and activities. The schedule must include for each activity a timeline for completion, quantitative measures, and detailed expense and manpower budgets. The schedule must provide a management tool that facilitates development of performance measures. 5. A summary budget for the scheduled land management activities of the land management plan. For state lands containing or anticipated to contain imperiled species habitat, the summary budget shall include any fees anticipated from public or private entities for projects to offset adverse impacts to imperiled species or such habitat, which fees must be used solely to restore, manage, enhance, repopulate, or acquire imperiled species habitat. The summary budget must be prepared in such manner that it facilitates computing an aggregate of land management costs for all state-managed lands using the categories described in s. 259.037(3). (d) Upon completion, the land management plan must be transmitted to the Acquisition and Restoration Council for review. Within 90 days after receipt of the plan, the council shall review the plan and submit its recommendations to the board of trustees. During the review period, the land management plan may be revised if agreed to by the primary land manager and the council taking into consideration public input. The land management plan becomes effective upon approval by the board of trustees. (e) Land management plans are to be updated every 10 years on a rotating basis. Each updated land management plan must identify any conservation lands under the plan, in part or in whole, that are no longer needed for conservation purposes and could be disposed of in fee simple or with the state retaining a permanent conservation easement. (f) In developing or updating land management plans, at least one public hearing must be held in any one affected county. (g) The Division of State Lands shall make available to the public at least 30 days before the public hearing required by paragraph (f) an electronic copy of each land management plan for parcels that exceed 160 acres in size and for parcels located within a state park. The division shall review each plan for compliance with the requirements of this subsection, the requirements of chapter 259, and the requirements of the rules adopted by the board of trustees pursuant to this section. The Acquisition and Restoration Council shall also consider the propriety of the recommendations of the managing entity with regard to the future use of the property, the protection of fragile or nonrenewable resources, the potential for alternative or multiple uses not recognized by the managing entity, and the possibility of disposal of the property by the board of trustees. After its review, the council shall submit the plan, along with its recommendations and comments, to the board of trustees. The council shall specifically recommend to the board of trustees whether to approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan with modifications, or reject the plan. If the council fails to make a recommendation for a land management plan, the Secretary of Environmental Protection, Commissioner of Agriculture, or executive director of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or their designees must submit the land management plan to the board of trustees. (h) The board of trustees shall consider the land management plan submitted by each entity and the recommendations of the Acquisition and Restoration Council and the Division of State Lands and shall approve the plan with or without modification or reject such plan. The use or possession of any such lands which is not in accordance with an approved land management plan is subject to termination by the board of trustees. (i)1. State nonconservation lands must be managed to provide the greatest benefit to the state. State nonconservation lands may be grouped by similar land use types under one land use plan. Each land use plan must, at a minimum, contain the following elements: a. A physical description of the land to include any significant natural or cultural resources as well as management strategies developed by the land manager to protect such resources. b. A desired development outcome. c. A schedule for achieving the desired development outcome. d. A description of both short-term and long-term development goals. e. A management and control plan for invasive nonnative plants. f. A management and control plan for soil erosion and soil and water contamination. g. Measurable objectives to achieve the goals identified in the land use plan. 2. Short-term goals shall be achievable within a 5-year planning period and long-term goals shall be achievable within a 10-year planning period. 3. The use or possession of any such lands that is not in accordance with an approved land use plan is subject to termination by the board of trustees. 4. Land use plans submitted by a manager shall include reference to appropriate statutory authority for such use or uses and shall conform to the appropriate policies and guidelines of the state land management plan. (6) This section does not affect: (a) Other provisions of this chapter relating to oil, gas, or mineral resources. (b) The exclusive use of state-owned land subject to a lease by the board of trustees of state-owned land for private uses and purposes. (c) Sovereignty lands not leased for private uses and purposes. (7)(a) The Legislature recognizes the value of the state’s conservation lands as water recharge areas and air filters. (b) If state-owned lands are subject to annexation procedures, the Division of State Lands must notify the county legislative delegation of the county in which the land is located. (8) Land management plans required to be submitted by the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Department of Children and Families, or the Department of Education are not subject to review by the Acquisition and Restoration Council. Management plans filed by these agencies shall be made available to the public for a period of 90 days at the administrative offices of the parcel or project affected by the management plan and at the Tallahassee offices of each agency. Any plans not objected to during the public comment period shall be deemed approved. Any plans for which an objection is filed shall be submitted to the board of trustees for consideration. The board of trustees shall approve the plan with or without modification, or reject the plan. The use or possession of any such lands which is not in accordance with an approved land management plan is subject to termination by the board of trustees. (9) The following additional uses of conservation lands acquired pursuant to the Florida Forever program and other state-funded conservation land purchase programs shall be authorized, upon a finding by the board of trustees, if they meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)-(e): water resource development projects, water supply development projects, stormwater management projects, linear facilities, and sustainable agriculture and forestry. Such additional uses are authorized if: (a) The use is not inconsistent with the management plan for such lands; (b) The use is compatible with the natural ecosystem and resource values of such lands; (c) The use is appropriately located on such lands and due consideration is given to the use of other available lands; (d) The using entity reasonably compensates the titleholder for such use based upon an appropriate measure of value; and (e) The use is consistent with the public interest. A decision by the board of trustees pursuant to this section shall be given a presumption of correctness. Moneys received from the use of state lands pursuant to this section shall be returned to the lead managing entity in accordance with s. 259.032(9)(c). (10) Lands listed as projects for acquisition may be managed for conservation pursuant to s. 259.032, on an interim basis by a private party in anticipation of a state purchase in accordance with a contractual arrangement between the acquiring agency and the private party that may include management service contracts, leases, cost-share arrangements or resource conservation agreements. Lands designated as eligible under this subsection shall be managed to maintain or enhance the resources the state is seeking to protect by acquiring the land. Funding for these contractual arrangements may originate from the documentary stamp tax revenue deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. No more than $6.2 million may be expended from the Land Acquisition Trust Fund for this purpose. (11) Any lands available to governmental employees, including water management district employees, for hunting or other recreational purposes shall also be made available to the general public for such purposes.

      "text": "253.0341 Surplus of state-owned lands.— 1 (1) The board of trustees shall determine which lands, the title to which is vested in the board, may be surplused. For all conservation lands, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall make a recommendation to the board of trustees, and the board of trustees shall determine whether the lands are no longer needed for conservation purposes. If the board of trustees determines the lands are no longer needed for conservation purposes, it may dispose of such lands by an affirmative vote of at least three members. In the case of a land exchange involving the disposition of conservation lands, the board of trustees must determine by an affirmative vote of at least three members that the exchange will result in a net positive conservation benefit. For all nonconservation lands, the board of trustees shall determine whether the lands are no longer needed. If the board of trustees determines the lands are no longer needed, it may dispose of such lands by an affirmative vote of at least three members. Local government requests for the state to surplus conservation or nonconservation lands, whether for purchase, exchange, or any other means of transfer, must be expedited throughout the surplusing process. Property jointly acquired by the state and other entities may not be surplused without the consent of all joint owners. (2) For purposes of this section, all lands acquired by the state before July 1, 1999, using proceeds from Preservation 2000 bonds, the former Conservation and Recreation Lands Trust Fund, the former Water Management Lands Trust Fund, Environmentally Endangered Lands Program, and the Save Our Coast Program and titled to the board of trustees which are identified as core parcels or within original project boundaries are deemed to have been acquired for conservation purposes. (3) For any lands purchased by the state on or after July 1, 1999, before acquisition, the board of trustees must determine which parcels must be designated as having been acquired for conservation purposes. Lands acquired for use by the Department of Corrections; the Department of Management Services for use as state offices; the Department of Transportation, except those lands specifically managed for conservation or recreation purposes; the State University System; or the Florida College System may not be designated as having been acquired for conservation purposes. (4) At least every 10 years, as a component of each land management plan or land use plan and in a form and manner adopted by rule of the board of trustees, each manager shall evaluate and indicate to the board of trustees those lands that are not being used for the purpose for which they were originally leased. For conservation lands, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall review and recommend to the board of trustees whether such lands should be retained in public ownership or disposed of by the board of trustees. For nonconservation lands, the Division of State Lands shall review and recommend to the board of trustees whether such lands should be retained in public ownership or disposed of by the board of trustees. (5) Conservation lands owned by the board of trustees which are not actively managed by any state agency or for which a land management plan has not been completed pursuant to s. 253.034(5) must be reviewed by the Acquisition and Restoration Council for its recommendation as to whether such lands should be disposed of by the board of trustees. (6) Before any decision by the board of trustees to surplus conservation lands, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall review and make recommendations to the board of trustees concerning the request for surplusing. The council shall determine whether the request for surplusing is compatible with the resource values of and management objectives for such lands. (7) Before a building or parcel of land is offered for lease or sale to a local or federal unit of government or a private party, it must first be offered for lease to state agencies. Within 60 days after the offer for lease of a surplus building or parcel, a state agency that requests the lease of such facility or parcel must submit a plan for review and approval by the board of trustees regarding the intended use. The state agency plan must, at a minimum, include the proposed use of the facility or parcel, the estimated cost of renovation, a capital improvement plan for the building, evidence that the building or parcel meets an existing need that cannot otherwise be met, and other criteria developed by rule by the board of trustees. The board or its designee shall compare the estimated value of the building or parcel to any submitted business plan to determine if the lease or sale is in the best interest of the state. The board of trustees shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 120 for the implementation of this section. (8) The sale price of lands determined to be surplus pursuant to this section and s. 253.82 shall be determined by the Division of State Lands, which shall consider an appraisal of the property or, if the estimated value of the land is $500,000 or less, a comparable sales analysis or a broker’s opinion of value. The value must be based on the highest and best use of the property, considering all applicable development rights, to ensure the maximum benefit and use to the state as provided in s. 253.03(7)(a). The division may require a second appraisal. The individual or entity that requests to purchase the surplus parcel shall pay all costs associated with determining the property’s value, if any. As used in this subsection, the term “highest and best use” means the reasonable, probable, and legal use of vacant land or an improved property which is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and results in the highest value. (a) A written valuation of land determined to be surplus pursuant to this section and s. 253.82, and related documents used to form the valuation or which pertain to the valuation, are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. 1. The exemption expires 2 weeks before the contract or agreement regarding the purchase, exchange, or disposal of the surplus land is first considered for approval by the board of trustees. 2. Before expiration of the exemption, the Division of State Lands may disclose confidential and exempt appraisals, valuations, or valuation information regarding surplus land: a. During negotiations for the sale or exchange of the land; b. During the marketing effort or bidding process associated with the sale, disposal, or exchange of the land to facilitate closure of such effort or process; c. When the passage of time has made the conclusions of value invalid; or d. When negotiations or marketing efforts concerning the land are concluded. (b) A unit of government that acquires title to lands pursuant to this section for less than appraised value may not sell or transfer title to all or any portion of the lands to any private owner for 10 years. A unit of government seeking to transfer or sell lands pursuant to this paragraph must first allow the board of trustees to reacquire such lands for the price at which the board of trustees sold such lands. (9) Parcels with a market value over $500,000 must be initially offered for sale by competitive bid. Any parcels unsuccessfully offered for sale by competitive bid, and parcels with a market value of $500,000 or less, may be sold by any reasonable means, including procuring real estate services, open or exclusive listings, competitive bid, auction, negotiated direct sales, or other appropriate services, to facilitate the sale. (10) After reviewing the recommendations of the Acquisition and Restoration Council, the board of trustees shall determine whether conservation lands identified for surplus should be held for other public purposes or are no longer needed. The board of trustees may require an agency to release its interest in such lands. An entity approved to use conservation lands by the board of trustees must secure the property under a fully executed lease within 90 days after being notified that it may use such property or the request is voidable. (11) Requests to surplus lands may be made by any public or private entity or person and shall be determined by the board of trustees. All requests to surplus conservation lands shall be submitted to the lead managing agency for review and recommendation to the Acquisition and Restoration Council, and all requests to surplus nonconservation lands shall be submitted to the Division of State Lands for review and recommendation to the board of trustees. The lead managing agencies shall review such requests and make recommendations to the council within 90 days after receipt of the requests. Any requests to surplus conservation lands that are not acted upon within the 90-day period shall be immediately scheduled for hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the council. Requests to surplus lands shall be considered by the board of trustees within 60 days after receipt of the requests from the council or division. Requests to surplus lands pursuant to this subsection are not required to be offered to state agencies as provided in subsection (7). (12) Proceeds from the sale of surplus conservation lands purchased before July 1, 2015, shall be deposited into the Florida Forever Trust Fund. (13) Proceeds from the sale of surplus conservation lands purchased on or after July 1, 2015, shall be deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund, except when such lands were purchased with funds other than those from the Land Acquisition Trust Fund or a land acquisition trust fund created to implement s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution, the proceeds shall be deposited into the fund from which the lands were purchased. (14)(a) Funds received from the sale of surplus nonconservation lands or lands that were acquired by gift, by donation, or for no consideration shall be deposited into the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), funds received from the sale of surplus state-owned office buildings, as defined in s. 255.248, and the nonconservation lands associated with such buildings shall be deposited into the Architects Incidental Trust Fund, as established pursuant to s. 215.196. (15) Notwithstanding this section, such disposition of land may not be made if it would have the effect of causing all or any portion of the interest on any revenue bonds issued to lose the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes. (16) The sale of filled, formerly submerged land that does not exceed 5 acres in area is not subject to review by the Acquisition and Restoration Council. (17) The board of trustees may adopt rules to administer this section, including procedures for administering surplus land requests and criteria for when the Division of State Lands may approve requests to surplus nonconservation lands on behalf of the board of trustees. (18) Surplus lands that are conveyed to a local government for affordable housing shall be disposed of by the local government under s. 125.379 or s. 166.0451. (19) Notwithstanding any other law or rule, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services may surplus lands acquired pursuant to s. 366.20 which are determined to be suitable for bona fide agricultural production, as defined in s. 193.461. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall consult with the Department of Environmental Protection in the process of making such determination.

This section does not apply to structures for viewing motorboat racing, high-speed motorboat contests, or high-speed displays in waters where manatees are known to frequent. (2) A lease or letter of consent for a special event under subsection (1): (a) Shall be for a period not to exceed 45 days and a duration not to exceed 10 consecutive years. (b) Shall include a lease fee, if applicable, based solely on the period and actual size of the preemption and conditions to allow reconfiguration of temporary structures within the lease area with notice to the department of the configuration and size of preemption within the lease area. (c) The lease or letter of consent may contain appropriate requirements for removal of the temporary structures, including the posting of sufficient surety to guarantee appropriate funds for removal of the structures should the promoter or riparian owner fail to do so within the time specified in the agreement. (3) This section does not allow any lease or letter of consent that would result in harm to the natural resources of the area as a result of the structures or the activities of the special events agreed to.

The lead agency shall prepare the analysis, which shall contain a component or section prepared by a qualified professional forester which assesses the feasibility of managing timber resources on the parcel for resource conservation and revenue generation purposes through a stewardship ethic that embraces sustainable forest management practices if the lead management agency determines that the timber resource management is not in conflict with the primary management objectives of the parcel. For purposes of this section, practicing sustainable forest management means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs by practicing a land stewardship ethic which integrates the reforestation, managing, growing, nurturing, and harvesting of trees for useful products with the conservation of soil, air and water quality, wildlife and fish habitat, and aesthetics. The Legislature intends that each lead management agency, whenever practicable and cost effective, use the services of the Florida Forest Service of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services or other qualified private sector professional forester in completing such feasibility assessments and implementing timber resource management. The Legislature further intends that the lead management agency develop a memorandum of agreement with the Florida Forest Service to provide for full reimbursement for any services provided for the feasibility assessments or timber resource management. All additional revenues generated through multiple-use management or compatible secondary use management shall be returned to the lead agency responsible for such management and shall be used to pay for management activities on all conservation, preservation, and recreation lands under the agency’s jurisdiction. In addition, such revenue shall be segregated in an agency trust fund and shall remain available to the agency in subsequent fiscal years to support land management appropriations.

The notice shall include the name and address of the applicant; a brief description of the proposed activity and any mitigation; the location of the proposed activity, including whether it is located within an Outstanding Florida Water or aquatic preserve; a map identifying the location of the proposed activity subject to the application; a diagram of the limits of the proposed activity; and a name or number identifying the application and the office where the application can be inspected, and any other information required by rule. A copy of this notice shall be sent to those persons who have requested to be on a mailing list and to each owner of land lying within 500 feet of the land proposed to be leased, sold, exchanged, or subject to an easement, addressed to such owner as the owner’s name and address appears on the latest county tax assessment roll. (2) The board of trustees, the department, or a water management district, as is appropriate, shall consider comments and objections received in response to the public notice required by this section in reaching its decision to approve or deny use of board of trustees-owned lands for a proposed activity. In the event that substantive objections are raised, the department or water management district may hold an informal public hearing in the county in which the proposed activity lies.

The sale of sovereignty submerged lands shall require a determination that the proposed sale is in the public interest. (3) The board may also publish, or require an applicant to publish, in a newspaper of general circulation within the affected area, a notice of receipt of the application and a notice of intended agency action. The board shall also provide notice of intended agency action to the applicant and to those who have requested a copy of the intended agency action for that application. (4) Failure to provide the notice as set out in subsections (1) and (3) shall not invalidate the sale, exchange, lease, or easement. (5) The notice and publication requirements of this section do not apply to: (a) The release of any reservations contained in Murphy Act deeds or deeds of the board of trustees; (b) Any conveyance of land lying landward of the line of mean high water, which land does not exceed 5 acres in area; (c) Any lands covered by the provisions of ss. 253.12(6), (9), and (10), and 253.129; (d) The lease or easement for any land when the land is being leased to a state agency; (e) Sovereignty land easements for existing activities completed prior to March 27, 1982; (f) The conversion of existing marina licenses to sovereignty land leases; (g) Sovereignty land leases for registered and existing unregistered grandfathered facilities; (h) The conveyance of lands pursuant to the provisions of former s. 373.4592(4)(b); (i) Renewals, modifications, or assignments; or (j) Lands managed pursuant to ss. 253.781-253.785. (6) The board may establish alternative notice requirements to those in subsections (1) and (3), including a waiver of notice, if adopted by rule for proposed activities under this section which also qualify for a general permit pursuant to chapter 373. Such alternative notice requirements shall take into account the nature and scope of the proposed activities and the effect on other persons.

For purposes of fixing bulkhead lines, restrictions on filling land and dredging beyond bulkhead lines, and permits required for filling and dredging, the board shall exercise the same authority over submerged lands owned by the state by right of its sovereignty in navigable freshwater lakes, rivers, and streams as it does over submerged lands otherwise defined in this subsection. (2)(a) The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund may sell and convey such islands and submerged lands if determined by the board to be in the public interest, upon such prices, terms, and conditions as it sees fit. However, prior to consummating any such sale, the board shall determine to what extent the sale of such islands or submerged lands and their ownership by private persons or the conveyance of such islands or submerged lands to political subdivisions or public agencies would interfere with the conservation of fish, marine and other wildlife, or other natural resources, including beaches and shores, and would result in destruction of oyster beds, clam beds, or marine productivity, including, but not limited to, destruction of marine habitats, grass flats suitable as nursery or feeding grounds for marine life, and established marine soils suitable for producing plant growth of a type useful as nursery or feeding grounds for marine life, and if so, in what respect and to what extent, and it shall consider any other factors affecting the public interests. (b) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (a), the board shall not sell or convey any interest in such islands and submerged lands to any applicant who does not, at the time of making application for purchase or conveyance, also have before the board: 1. An application for the establishment of a bulkhead line, in the event no bulkhead line is established for the lands subject to the application; and 2. An application for approval of a fill permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and 3. A permit or application for a permit to dredge fill material from beneath the navigable waters of the state, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, in the event the applicant intends to secure such fill material. However, such islands or submerged lands may be sold or conveyed to an applicant who does not have such an application for a permit to dredge or fill lands before the board, upon the condition that the sale or conveyance to such an applicant shall contain a restrictive covenant prohibiting dredging, except for navigation purposes, or filling of such islands or submerged lands. The board shall reserve the authority to waive such restrictive covenant when such waiver is in the public interest, pursuant to such terms and conditions as the board may impose. (3) After receiving application in compliance with such forms as may be required to show clearly what is intended to be accomplished in any proposed development of said lands and the manner in which said development will be accomplished, and after making the determination required by paragraph (2)(a), the board shall give notice as provided by s. 253.115. (4) If objections are filed, the board shall proceed to determine the merits of the objections. The report required by subsection (7) shall be made part of the record and duly considered at any hearing. If it appears that the sale of such islands and submerged lands and their ownership by private persons or the conveyance of such islands or submerged lands to political subdivisions or public agencies would: (a) Be contrary to the public interest; (b) Interfere with the lawful rights granted riparian owners; (c) Be, or result in, a serious impediment to navigation; (d) Interfere with the conservation of fish, marine and other wildlife, or other natural resources, including beaches and shores, to such an extent as to be contrary to the public interest; or (e) Result in the destruction of oyster beds, clam beds, or marine productivity, including, but not limited to, destruction of natural marine habitats, grass flats suitable as nursery or feeding grounds for marine life, and established marine soils suitable for producing plant growth of a type useful as nursery or feeding grounds for marine life to such an extent as to be contrary to the public interest, the board shall withdraw the lands from sale. Prior to making the determinations above required, the board may consider any other factors affecting the public interest. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, lands defined herein lying between the ordinary mean high-water line and any bulkhead line established hereunder shall be sold only to the upland riparian owner and to no other person, firm, or corporation; and such sale to the upland riparian owner shall be made pursuant to the provisions herein. (5)(a) When any state agency or county, city, or other political subdivision extends or adds to existing lands or islands bordering on or being in the navigable waters, as defined in this section, of the state by filling in or causing to be filled in or by draining or causing to be drained such waters, the board may, upon application therefor, convey to the riparian owner or owners of the upland so extended or added to so much of such extended or added land as is not required exclusively for a municipal, county, state, or other public purpose. The board may, however, require a deposit to accompany such application of a sum sufficient to cover the actual cost and expenses of processing such application and preparing instruments of conveyance. (b) Neither this subsection nor any other provision of this chapter shall be construed to permit any state agency or county, city, or other political subdivision to construct islands or extend or add to existing lands or islands bordering on or being in the navigable waters as defined herein or drain such waters for a municipal, county, state, or other public purpose unless such agency is the riparian upland owner or holds the consent in writing of the riparian upland owner consenting to such construction or extension or drainage operation. For the purposes of this subsection, “riparian upland owners” shall be defined as those persons owning upland property abutting those portions of the waters to be filled or drained, which are within 1,000 feet outboard of said riparian upland, but not more than one-half the distance to the opposite upland, if any, and within the extensions of the side boundary lines thereof, when said side boundary lines are extended in the direction of the channel along an alignment which would be required to distribute equitably the submerged land between the upland and the channel. However, nothing herein shall be construed to deny or limit any state agency or county, city, or other political subdivision from exercising the right of eminent domain to the extent and for the purposes authorized by law in connection with such construction, extension, or drainage projects; and nothing herein shall be construed to have application in those instances when the board is authorized by law to establish an erosion control line to implement an authorized beach nourishment, replenishment, or erosion-control project, or for the placement of sand dredged from navigation channels on beaches fronting the waters of the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of America, provided such sand is not placed landward of existing lines of vegetation. (6) Where any person, state agency, county, city, or other political subdivision prior to June 11, 1957, extended or added to existing lands or islands bordering on or being in the navigable waters as defined in this section by filling in or causing to be filled in such lands, the board shall upon application therefor convey said land so filled to the riparian owner or owners of the upland so extended or added to. The consideration for such conveyance shall be the appraised value of said lands as they existed prior to such filling. (7)(a) In order to assist it in making the determination required by paragraph (2)(a), the board shall require that a biological survey and an ecological study of the lands or interests therein proposed to be sold or conveyed pursuant to any particular application be made, and, when determined by the Department of Environmental Protection to be necessary, that a hydrographic survey be made. All such surveys and studies shall be made by or under the direction of the Department of Environmental Protection, which shall make a report of all such surveys and studies to the board together with its recommendations. The board may adopt regulations requiring that the cost of making any such survey and report be paid by the applicant for purchase of such lands, requiring a deposit by the applicant sufficient to ensure such payment, and providing procedures to be followed in applying for and obtaining such survey and report. (b) If, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2)(b), the surveys and study required by paragraph (a) have already been made, the provisions of this section shall not operate to require an applicant to pay for any additional surveys or studies within 3 years prior to the issuance of such permit. (8) All conveyances of sovereignty lands or fill material therein heretofore made by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund of Florida subsequent to the enactment of chapter 6451, Acts of 1913, chapter 7304, Acts of 1917, and chapter 57-362, as amended, are hereby ratified, confirmed, and validated in all respects. 1 (9) All of the state’s right, title, and interest to all tidally influenced land or tidally influenced islands bordering or being on sovereignty land, which have been permanently extended, filled, added to existing lands, or created before July 1, 1975, by fill, and might be owned by the state, is hereby granted to the landowner having record or other title to all or a portion thereof or to the lands immediately upland thereof and its successors in interest. Thereafter, such lands shall be considered private property, and the state, its political subdivisions, agencies, and all persons claiming by, through, or under any of them, shall be barred from asserting that any such lands are publicly owned sovereignty lands. The foregoing provisions shall act to transfer title only to so much of such extended or added land as was permanently exposed, extended, or added to before July 1, 1975. A showing of dates by which certain lands were filled or added to may be made by aerial photograph or other reasonable method. Upon request of the landowner and submission of a proposed legal description and aerial photographs or other evidence accompanied by a fee set by the board reflecting the actual administrative cost of processing, the board shall provide an appropriate legal description of the waterward boundary line as of July 1, 1975, in a recordable document. The Legislature specifically finds and declares these grants to be in the public interest. The boundary between state-owned sovereignty lands and privately owned uplands is ambulatory and will move as a result of nonavulsive changes. This subsection shall not grant or vest title to any filled, formerly submerged state-owned lands in any person who, as of January 1, 1993, is the record titleholder of the filled or adjacent upland property and who filled or caused to be filled the state-owned lands. 1 (10) Subsection (9) shall not operate to affect the title to lands which have been judicially adjudicated or which were the subject of litigation pending on January 1, 1993, involving title to such lands. Further, the provisions of subsection (9) shall not apply to spoil islands nor to any lands which are included on an official acquisition list, on July 1, 1993, of a state agency or water management district for conservation, preservation, or recreation, nor to lands maintained as state or local recreation areas or shore protection structures.

(1) The board of trustees may exchange any lands owned by, vested in, or titled in its name for other lands in the state owned by counties, local governments, individuals, or private or public corporations, and may fix the terms and conditions of any such exchange. For conservation lands acquired by the state through gift, donation, or any other conveyance for which no consideration was paid, the state may request land of equal conservation value from the county or local government but no other consideration. (2) In exchanging state-owned lands not acquired by the state through gift, donation, or any other conveyance for which no consideration was paid, with counties or local governments, the board of trustees shall require an exchange of equal value. Equal value is defined as the conservation benefit of the lands being offered for exchange by a county or local government being equal or greater in conservation benefit than the state-owned lands. Such exchanges may include cash transactions if based on an appropriate measure of value of the state-owned land, but must also include the determination of a net-positive conservation benefit by the Acquisition and Restoration Council, irrespective of appraised value. (3) The board of trustees shall select and agree upon the state lands to be exchanged and the lands to be conveyed to the state and shall pay or receive any sum of money the board of trustees deems necessary for the purpose of equalizing the value of the exchanged property. The board of trustees is authorized to make and enter into contracts or agreements for such purpose or purposes. (4)(a) A person who owns land contiguous to state-owned land titled to the board of trustees may submit a request to the Division of State Lands to exchange all or a portion of the privately owned land for all or a portion of the state-owned land, whereby the state retains a permanent conservation easement over all or a portion of the exchanged state-owned land and a permanent conservation easement over all or a portion of the exchanged privately owned land. State-owned land exchanged pursuant to this subsection shall be contiguous to the privately owned land upon which the state retains a permanent conservation easement. If the division elects to proceed with a request, the division must submit the request to the Acquisition and Restoration Council for review and the council must provide recommendations to the division. If the division elects to forward a request to the board of trustees, the division must provide its recommendations and the recommendations of the council to the board. This subsection does not apply to state-owned sovereign submerged land. (b) After receiving a request and the division’s recommendations, the board of trustees shall consider such request and recommendations and may approve the request if: 1. At least 30 percent of the perimeter of the privately owned land is bordered by state-owned land and the exchange does not create an inholding. 2. The approval does not result in a violation of the terms of a preexisting lease or agreement by the board of trustees, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, or the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 3. For state-owned land purchased for conservation purposes, the board of trustees makes a determination that the exchange of land under this subsection will result in a net positive conservation benefit. 4. The approval does not conflict with any existing flowage easement. 5. The request is approved by three or more members of the board of trustees. (c) Special consideration shall be given to a request that maintains public access for any recreational purpose allowed on the state-owned land at the time the request is submitted to the board of trustees. A person who maintains public access pursuant to this paragraph is entitled to the limitation on liability provided in s. 375.251. (d) Land subject to a permanent conservation easement granted pursuant to this subsection is subject to inspection by the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure compliance with the terms of the permanent conservation easement.

Leases shall be renewable for successive terms up to the same maximum upon agreement of the parties. (2) RENTAL FEES.— (a) The lease contract shall specify such amount of rental per acre of leased bottom as may be agreed to by the parties and shall take the form of fixed rental to be paid throughout the term of the lease. Beginning January 1, 1990, a surcharge of $5 per acre, or any fraction of an acre, per annum shall be levied upon each lease according to the guidelines set forth in s. 597.010(7). Beginning January 1, 2001, the surcharge shall be increased to $10 per acre, or any fraction of an acre, per annum. (b) All leases shall stipulate for the payment of the initial term’s first year’s annual rental within 30 days of the date of execution of the lease instrument, and payment of the annual rental fee for all succeeding years throughout the term of the lease on or before the anniversary date. Failure of the lessee to pay such rent within 30 days of such date shall constitute ground for cancellation of the lease and forfeiture to the state of all works, improvements, and animal and plant life in and upon the leased land and water column. (3) MAXIMUM AREA TO BE LEASED.—The board shall not lease a larger area of submerged land to any single lessee than has been demonstrated to be within the lessee’s capacity to utilize efficiently and consistent with the public interest. However, the board may hold a reasonable area of adjacent bottom land in reserve for the time when a holder of an experimental lease will begin operation under a commercial lease. Successful conduct of aquaculture activities on an experimental basis may be accepted as a demonstration of capacity to conduct such operations on a commercial basis. (4) PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.—Failure of the lessee to perform effective cultivation shall constitute ground for cancellation of the lease and forfeiture to the state of all the works, improvements, and animal and plant life in and upon the leased land and water column. Effective cultivation shall consist of the grow out of the aquaculture product according to the business plan provided in the lease contract. (5) DISPOSITION OF IMPROVEMENTS AT TERMINATION OF CONTRACT.—Each contract entered into under this act shall stipulate the disposition of improvements and assets upon the leased lands and waters, including animal and plant life resulting from aquaculture activities. (6) ASSIGNABILITY OF LEASES.—Leases granted under this act shall be assignable in whole or in part with the approval of the board. (7) SPECIAL LEASE CONDITIONS.—Leases granted under this section may contain special lease conditions that provide for flexibility in surveying and posting lease boundaries, incorporate conditions necessary to issue permits pursuant to part IV of chapter 373 and chapter 403, and provide for special activities related to aquaculture and resource management.

(2) Except to the extent necessary to permit the effective development of the species of animal or plant life being cultivated by the lessee, the public shall be provided with means of reasonable ingress and egress to and from the leased area for traditional water activities such as boating, swimming, and fishing. All limitations upon the use by the public of the areas under lease that are authorized by the terms of the lease shall be clearly posted by the lessee pursuant to rules by the board.

Review of final agency action for the purpose of determining whether the action is in accordance with existing statutes or rules and based on competent substantial evidence shall proceed in accordance with chapter 120. (3) If the court determines the decision reviewed is an unreasonable exercise of the state’s police power constituting a taking without just compensation, the court shall remand the matter to the agency which shall, within a reasonable time: (a) Agree to issue the permit; (b) Agree to pay appropriate monetary damages; however, in determining the amount of compensation to be paid, consideration shall be given by the court to any enhancement to the value of the land attributable to governmental action; or (c) Agree to modify its decision to avoid an unreasonable exercise of police power. (4) The agency shall submit a statement of its agreed-upon action to the court in the form of a proposed order. If the action is a reasonable exercise of police power, the court shall enter its final order approving the proposed order. If the agency fails to submit a proposed order within a reasonable time not to exceed 90 days which specifies an action that is a reasonable exercise of police power, the court may order the agency to perform any of the alternatives specified in subsection (3).

Future site-specific studies and investigations must be conducted by the department to determine compatibility with, and potential for adverse impact to, existing natural resources, need for the facility, the availability of other alternative locations with reduced adverse impacts to existing natural resources, and the proper specific sites and locations for the more comprehensive and complex facilities. Furthermore, it is appropriate, with the approval of the department, to allow more fishing docks, boat launches, and other user-oriented facilities to be developed and maintained by local governments. (2) In determining appropriate recreational uses of greenways lands, the promotion and development of resources-based activities shall be given priority consideration, although user-oriented activities shall not be arbitrarily prohibited when site-specific studies indicate compatibility of the proposed use with natural or cultural resources. (3) For purposes of this section, “user-oriented activities” are those which can be provided in a variety of locations and include such activities as golf, tennis, baseball, archery, target shooting, and playground activities. “Resources-based” activities are dependent on some particular element or combination of elements in the natural or cultural environment and include such activities as fishing, camping, hunting, boating, bicycling, nature study, horseback riding, visiting historical sites, and hiking. (4)(a) A horse park-agricultural center may be constructed by or on behalf of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services on not more than 500 acres of former canal lands. (b) A multipurpose visitor center may be constructed in conjunction with the horse park-agricultural center on lands dedicated for the horse park-agricultural center. (c) Resources-based recreational activities associated with the horse park-agricultural center, including, but not limited to, recreational trails, trails for endurance or competitive riding, steeplechase, and other related activities may be permitted within the greenways boundary. The greenways managing entity shall retain jurisdiction over such activities occurring within the greenways boundary. (d) Those activities and structures associated with the horse park-agricultural center which are determined by the greenways managing entity to be inappropriate uses of greenways lands shall be sited on lands outside the greenways boundary.

When these crossings are needed, the location and design should consider and mitigate the impact on environmental resources, and the value of the land shall be paid based on fair market value. (2) In furtherance of previous legislative decisions and policy, the Legislature recognizes the need for the Lebanon Station-to-Wildwood Turnpike toll road extension and the need for it to cross greenways lands at the intersection of State Road 200 and State Road 484. The Department of Transportation shall pay fair compensation for the lands needed to accomplish the crossing of greenways lands and shall mitigate the impacts of the crossing to the extent practical. (3) Furthermore, the Legislature recognizes the needs expressed by Marion County to provide for the southerly extension of Sixtieth Avenue between State Road 200 and Interstate 75 and for the extension to cross the greenways lands to allow for the orderly growth and development of Marion County.

The rights that are released under this subsection are all rights in the land, including state-held subsurface rights. (b) Upon request by any person, the county tax collector shall record in the official records of the county in which the land is located a certificate that the taxes have been paid since January 1, 1971, by the landowner or the landowner’s predecessor in title, if in fact the taxes have been paid. Such certificate is conclusive evidence of that fact. (2)(a) The title to any land which was acquired by the state under chapter 18296, Laws of Florida, 1937, except those parcels which have been sold, conveyed, dedicated, or released by the state pursuant to subsection (1), is hereby vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. (b) Land to which title is vested in the board of trustees by paragraph (a) shall be treated in the same manner as other nonsovereignty lands owned by the board. However, any parcel of land the title to which is vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund pursuant to this section which is 10 acres or less in size and has a market value of $250,000 or less is hereby declared surplus, except for lands determined to be needed for state use, and may be sold in any manner provided by law. All proceeds from the sale of such land shall be deposited into the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund is authorized to adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection. (c) The holder of a claim or lien against land vested in the board of trustees by paragraph (a), including a municipality or special taxing district, has until October 1, 1985, to institute suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to establish or enforce the claim or lien. The failure to institute suit by October 1, 1985, is conclusive evidence of abandonment of the claim or lien, and such claim or lien will become unenforceable. This paragraph shall not operate to revive any claim or lien previously extinguished by operation of law. (3) Any person who has a claim to Murphy Act lands based upon a defect in a deed executed by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund has until October 1, 1985, to institute suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to establish the claim, or it will be forever barred.
