(2) A person may not sell, assign, or transfer an off-highway vehicle titled by the state without delivering to the purchaser or transferee a valid certificate of title with an assignment on it showing the transfer of title to the purchaser or transferee. A person may not purchase or otherwise acquire an off-highway vehicle required to be titled without obtaining a certificate of title for the vehicle in his or her name. The purchaser or transferee shall, within 30 days after a change in off-highway vehicle ownership, file an application for a title transfer with the county tax collector. An additional $10 fee shall be charged against a purchaser or transferee who files a title transfer application after the 30-day period. The county tax collector may retain $5 of the additional amount. (3) A certificate of title is prima facie evidence of the ownership of the off-highway vehicle and is good for the life of the off-highway vehicle so long as the certificate is owned or held by the legal holder. If a titled off-highway vehicle is destroyed or abandoned, the owner, with the consent of any recorded lienholders, shall, within 30 days after the destruction or abandonment, surrender to the department all title documents for cancellation. (4) The department shall provide labeled places on the title where the seller’s price shall be indicated when an off-highway vehicle is sold and where a selling dealer shall record his or her valid sales tax certificate of registration number. (5)(a) There shall be a service charge of $4.25 for each application that is handled in connection with the issuance, duplication, or transfer of any certificate of title. There shall be a service charge of $1.25 for each application that is handled in connection with the recording or notation of a lien on an off-highway vehicle that is not in connection with the purchase of such vehicle. (b) The service charges specified in paragraph (a) shall be collected by the department on any application handled directly from its office. Otherwise, these service charges shall be collected and retained by the tax collector who handles the application. (c) In addition to the fees provided in paragraph (a), any tax collector may impose an additional service charge of not more than 50 cents on any transaction specified in paragraph (a) when such transaction occurs at any tax collector’s branch office.

The application must include the true name of the owner, the residence or business address of the owner, and a complete description of the off-highway vehicle. The application must be signed by the owner and must be accompanied by a fee of $29. (2) The owner must establish proof of ownership by submitting with the application an executed bill of sale, a manufacturer’s statement of origin, an affidavit of ownership for off-highway vehicles purchased before the effective date of this act, or any other document acceptable to the department. (3) To apply for a certificate of title upon transfer of ownership of an off-highway vehicle, the new owner must surrender to the department the last title document issued for that vehicle. The document must be properly executed. Proper execution includes the previous owner’s signature and certification that the off-highway vehicle to be transferred is debt-free or is subject to a lien. If a lien exists, the previous owner must furnish the new owner, on forms supplied by the department, the names and addresses of all lienholders and the dates of all liens, with a statement from each lienholder that the lienholder has knowledge of and consents to the transfer of title to the new owner. (4) An application for an initial certificate of title or a title transfer must include payment of the applicable state sales tax or proof of payment of such tax, except for off-highway vehicles purchased or transferred before the effective date of this act. (5) If the owner submits a complete application and complies with all other requirements of this section, the department shall issue a certificate of title that states that the title is for an off-highway vehicle that is not suitable for highway use. After October 1, 2003, the department shall also issue a copy of the guidebook prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services pursuant to s. 261.07. (6) In addition to a certificate of title, the department may issue a validation sticker to be placed on the off-highway vehicle as proof of the issuance of title required pursuant to s. 317.0006(1). A validation sticker that is lost or destroyed may, upon application, be replaced by the department or county tax collector. The department and county tax collector may charge and deposit the fees established in ss. 320.03(5), 320.031, and 320.04 for all original and replacement decals.

(2) If, following the issuance of an original, duplicate, or corrected certificate of title by the department, the certificate is lost in transit and is not delivered to the addressee, the owner of the off-highway vehicle or the holder of a lien thereon may, within 180 days after the date of issuance of the certificate, apply to the department for reissuance of the certificate.
