      "text": "393.062 Legislative findings and declaration of intent.—The Legislature finds and declares that existing state programs for the treatment of individuals with developmental disabilities, which often unnecessarily place clients in institutions, are unreasonably costly, are ineffective in bringing the individual client to his or her maximum potential, and are in fact debilitating to many clients. A redirection in state treatment programs for individuals with developmental disabilities is necessary if any significant amelioration of the problems faced by such individuals is ever to take place. Such redirection should place primary emphasis on programs that prevent or reduce the severity of developmental disabilities. Further, the greatest priority shall be given to the development and implementation of community-based services that will enable individuals with developmental disabilities to achieve their greatest potential for independent and productive living, enable them to live in their own homes or in residences located in their own communities, and permit them to be diverted or removed from unnecessary institutional placements. This goal cannot be met without ensuring the availability of community residential opportunities in the residential areas of this state. The Legislature, therefore, declares that all persons with developmental disabilities who live in licensed community homes shall have a family living environment comparable to other Floridians and that such residences shall be considered and treated as a functional equivalent of a family unit and not as an institution, business, or boarding home. The Legislature further declares that, in developing community-based programs and services for individuals with developmental disabilities, private businesses, not-for-profit corporations, units of local government, and other organizations capable of providing needed services to clients in a cost-efficient manner shall be given preference in lieu of operation of programs directly by state agencies. Finally, it is the intent of the Legislature that all caretakers unrelated to individuals with developmental disabilities receiving care shall be of good moral character.

      "text": "393.064 Care navigation.— (1) Within available resources, the agency shall offer to clients and their caregivers care navigation services for voluntary participation at the time of application and as part of any eligibility or renewal review. The goals of care navigation are to create a seamless network of community resources and supports for the client and the client’s family as a whole to support a client in daily living, community integration, and achievement of individual goals. Care navigation services must involve assessing client needs and developing and implementing care plans, including, but not limited to, connecting a client to resources and supports. At a minimum, a care plan must address immediate, intermediate, and long-term needs and goals to promote and increase well-being and opportunities for education, employment, social engagement, community integration, and caregiver support. For a client who is a public school student entitled to a free appropriate public education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended, the care plan must be integrated with the student’s individual education plan (IEP). The care plan and IEP must be implemented to maximize the attainment of educational and habilitation goals. (2) Services provided by the agency must include services to high-risk children from 3 to 5 years of age, and their families, to meet the intent of chapter 411. Except for services for children from birth to age 3 years which are the responsibility of the Division of Children’s Medical Services in the Department of Health or part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, such services may include: (a) Individual evaluations or assessments necessary to diagnose a developmental disability or high-risk condition and to determine appropriate, individual family and support services. (b) Early intervention services, including developmental training and specialized therapies. (c) Support services, such as respite care, parent education and training, parent-to-parent counseling, homemaker services, and other services which allow families to maintain and provide quality care to children in their homes. (3) Other agencies of state government shall cooperate with and assist the agency, within available resources, in implementing programs which have the potential to prevent, or reduce the severity of, developmental disabilities and shall consider the findings and recommendations of the agency in developing and implementing agency programs and formulating agency budget requests. (4) There is created at the developmental disabilities center in Gainesville a research and education unit. Such unit shall be named the Raymond C. Philips Research and Education Unit. The functions of such unit shall include: (a) Research into the etiology of developmental disabilities. (b) Ensuring that new knowledge is rapidly disseminated throughout the agency. (c) Diagnosis of unusual conditions and syndromes associated with developmental disabilities in clients identified throughout developmental disabilities programs. (d) Evaluation of families of clients with developmental disabilities of genetic origin in order to provide them with genetic counseling aimed at preventing the recurrence of the disorder in other family members. (e) Ensuring that health professionals in the developmental disabilities center at Gainesville have access to information systems that will allow them to remain updated on newer knowledge and maintain their postgraduate education standards. (f) Enhancing staff training for professionals throughout the agency in the areas of genetics and developmental disabilities.

      "heading": "Application and eligibility determination.",
      "text": "393.065 Application and eligibility determination.— (1)(a) The agency shall develop and implement an online application process that, at a minimum, supports paperless, electronic application submissions with immediate e-mail confirmation to each applicant to acknowledge receipt of application upon submission. The online application system must allow an applicant to review the status of a submitted application and respond to provide additional information. The online application must allow an applicant to apply for crisis enrollment. (b) The agency shall maintain access to a printable paper application on its website and, upon request, must provide an applicant with a printed paper application. Paper applications may be submitted in writing to the agency in the region in which the applicant resides, sent to a central or regional address through regular United States mail, or faxed to a central or regional confidential fax number. The agency shall acknowledge receipt of all applications it receives, regardless of the manner of submission, with an immediate receipt confirmation provided in the same manner in which the application was received, unless the applicant has designated an alternative preferred method of communication on the submitted application. (c) The agency must review each submitted application in accordance with federal time standards. 1. If the agency determines additional documentation is necessary to make an eligibility determination, the agency may request the additional documentation from the applicant. 2. When necessary to definitively identify individual conditions or needs, the agency or its designee must provide a comprehensive assessment. (d)1. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “complete application” means an application submitted to the agency which is signed and dated by the applicant or an individual with legal authority to apply for public benefits on behalf of the applicant, is responsive on all parts of the application, and contains documentation of a diagnosis. 2. If the applicant requesting enrollment in the home and community-based services Medicaid waiver program for individuals with developmental disabilities is deemed to be in crisis as described in paragraph (5)(a), the agency must make an eligibility determination within 15 calendar days after receipt of a complete application. 3. If the applicant meets the criteria specified in paragraph (5)(b), the agency must review and make an eligibility determination as soon as practicable after receipt of a complete application. 4. If the application meets any of the criteria specified in paragraphs (5)(c)-(g), the agency must make an eligibility determination within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. (e) Any delays in the eligibility determination process, or any tolling of the time standard until certain information or actions have been completed, must be conveyed to the client as soon as such delays are known through verbal contact with the client or the client’s designated caregiver and confirmed by a written notice of the delay, the anticipated length of delay, and a contact person for the client. (2) In order to be eligible for services under this chapter, the agency must determine that the applicant has met all eligibility requirements in rule, including having a developmental disability and being domiciled in this state. Information accumulated by other agencies, including professional reports and collateral data, shall be considered in this process when available. (3) The agency or its designee shall notify each applicant, in writing, of its eligibility determination. Any applicant or client determined by the agency to be ineligible for services has the right to appeal this determination pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (4) Before admission to an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities and to ensure that the setting is the least restrictive to meet the individual’s needs, the agency must authorize admission pursuant to this subsection. As part of the authorization, the agency or its designee must conduct a comprehensive assessment that includes medical necessity, level of care, and level of reimbursement. (5) Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7), if a client seeking enrollment in the developmental disabilities home and community-based services Medicaid waiver program meets the level of care requirement for an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities pursuant to 42 C.F.R. ss. 435.217(b)(1) and 440.150, the agency must assign the client to an appropriate preenrollment category pursuant to this subsection and must provide priority to clients waiting for waiver services in the following order: (a) Category 1, which includes clients deemed to be in crisis as described in rule, must be given first priority in moving from the preenrollment categories to the waiver. (b) Category 2, which includes clients in the preenrollment categories who are: 1.

At least 18 years but not yet 22 years of age and who withdrew consent pursuant to s. 39.6251(5)(c) to remain in the extended foster care system. For individuals who are at least 18 years but not yet 22 years of age and who are eligible under sub-subparagraph 1.b., the agency must provide waiver services, including residential habilitation, and must actively participate in transition planning activities, including, but not limited to, individualized service coordination, case management support, and ensuring continuity of care pursuant to s. 39.6035. The community-based care lead agency must fund room and board at the rate established in s. 409.145(3) and provide case management and related services as defined in s. 409.986(3)(e). Individuals may receive both waiver services and services under s. 39.6251. Services may not duplicate services available through the Medicaid state plan. (c) Category 3, which includes, but is not required to be limited to, clients: 1. Whose caregiver has a documented condition that is expected to render the caregiver unable to provide care within the next 12 months and for whom a caregiver is required but no alternate caregiver is available; 2. At substantial risk of incarceration or court commitment without supports; 3. Whose documented behaviors or physical needs place them or their caregiver at risk of serious harm and other supports are not currently available to alleviate the situation; or 4. Who are identified as ready for discharge within the next year from a state mental health hospital or skilled nursing facility and who require a caregiver but for whom no caregiver is available or whose caregiver is unable to provide the care needed. (d) Category 4, which includes, but is not required to be limited to, clients whose caregivers are 60 years of age or older and for whom a caregiver is required but no alternate caregiver is available. (e) Category 5, which includes, but is not required to be limited to, clients who are expected to graduate within the next 12 months from secondary school and need support to obtain a meaningful day activity, maintain competitive employment, or pursue an accredited program of postsecondary education to which they have been accepted. (f) Category 6, which includes clients 21 years of age or older who do not meet the criteria for category 1, category 2, category 3, category 4, or category 5. (g) Category 7, which includes clients younger than 21 years of age who do not meet the criteria for category 1, category 2, category 3, or category 4. Within preenrollment categories 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the agency shall prioritize clients in the order of the date that the client is determined eligible for waiver services. (6) The agency must allow an individual who meets the eligibility requirements of subsection (2) to receive home and community-based services in this state if the individual’s parent or legal guardian is an active-duty military servicemember and if, at the time of the servicemember’s transfer to this state, the individual was receiving home and community-based services in another state. (7) The agency must allow an individual with a diagnosis of Phelan-McDermid syndrome who meets the eligibility requirements of subsection (2) to receive home and community-based services.

(10) The client, the client’s guardian, or the client’s family must ensure that accurate, up-to-date contact information is provided to the agency at all times. Notwithstanding s. 393.0651, the agency must send an annual letter requesting updated information from the client, the client’s guardian, or the client’s family. (11)(a) The agency must provide the following information to all applicants or their parents, legal guardians, or family members: 1.

      "text": "393.0651 Family or individual support plan.—The agency shall provide directly or contract for the development of a family support plan for children ages 3 to 18 years of age and an individual support plan for each client served by the home and community-based services Medicaid waiver program under s. 393.0662. The client, if competent, the client’s parent or guardian, or, when appropriate, the client advocate, shall be consulted in the development of the plan and shall receive a copy of the plan. Each plan must include the most appropriate, least restrictive, and most cost-beneficial environment for accomplishment of the objectives for client progress and a specification of all services authorized. The plan must include provisions for the most appropriate level of care for the client. Within the specification of needs and services for each client, when residential care is necessary, the agency shall move toward placement of clients in residential facilities based within the client’s community. The ultimate goal of each plan, whenever possible, shall be to enable the client to live a dignified life in the least restrictive setting, be that in the home or in the community. The family or individual support plan must be developed within 60 calendar days after the agency determines the client eligible pursuant to s. 393.065(3). (1) The agency shall develop and specify by rule the core components of support plans. (2) The family or individual support plan shall be integrated with the individual education plan (IEP) for all clients who are public school students entitled to a free appropriate public education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended. The family or individual support plan and IEP must be implemented to maximize the attainment of educational and habilitation goals. (a) If the IEP for a student enrolled in a public school program indicates placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide special education and related services to a client, the local education agency must provide for the costs of that service in accordance with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended. This does not preclude local education agencies and the agency from sharing the residential service costs of students who are clients and require residential placement. (b) For clients who are entering or exiting the school system, an interdepartmental staffing team composed of representatives of the agency and the local school system shall develop a written transitional living and training plan with the participation of the client or with the parent or guardian of the client, or the client advocate, as appropriate. (3) Each family or individual support plan shall be facilitated through case management designed solely to advance the individual needs of the client. (4) In the development of the family or individual support plan, a client advocate may be appointed by the support planning team for a client who is a minor or for a client who is not capable of express and informed consent when: (a) The parent or guardian cannot be identified; (b) The whereabouts of the parent or guardian cannot be discovered; or (c) The state is the only legal representative of the client. Such appointment may not be construed to extend the powers of the client advocate to include any of those powers delegated by law to a legal guardian. (5) The agency shall place a client in the most appropriate and least restrictive, and cost-beneficial, residential facility according to his or her individual support plan. The client, if competent, the client’s parent or guardian, or, when appropriate, the client advocate, and the administrator of the facility to which placement is proposed shall be consulted in determining the appropriate placement for the client. Considerations for placement shall be made in the following order: (a) Client’s own home or the home of a family member or direct service provider. (b) Foster care facility. (c) Group home facility. (d) Intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled. (e) Other facilities licensed by the agency which offer special programs for people with developmental disabilities. (f) Developmental disabilities center. (6) In developing a client’s annual family or individual support plan, the individual or family with the assistance of the support planning team shall identify measurable objectives for client progress and shall specify a time period expected for achievement of each objective. (7) The individual, family, and support coordinator shall review progress in achieving the objectives specified in each client’s family or individual support plan, and shall revise the plan annually, following consultation with the client, if competent, or with the parent or guardian of the client, or, when appropriate, the client advocate. The agency or designated contractor shall annually report in writing to the client, if competent, or to the parent or guardian of the client, or to the client advocate, when appropriate, with respect to the client’s habilitative and medical progress. (8) Any client, or any parent of a minor client, or guardian, authorized guardian advocate, or client advocate for a client, who is substantially affected by the client’s initial family or individual support plan, or the annual review thereof, shall have the right to file a notice to challenge the decision pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. Notice of such right to appeal shall be included in all support plans provided by the agency. (9) When developing or reviewing a client’s family or individual support plan, the waiver support coordinator shall inform the client, the client’s parent or guardian, or, when appropriate, the client advocate about the consumer-directed care program established under s. 409.221.

All elements of community-based services shall be made available, and eligibility for these services shall be consistent across the state. 1 (2) Necessary services shall be purchased, rather than provided directly by the agency, when the purchase of services is more cost-efficient than providing them directly. All purchased services must be approved by the agency. As a condition of payment and before billing, persons or entities under contract with the agency to provide services shall use agency data management systems to document service provision to clients or shall maintain such information in its own data management system and electronically transmit it to the agency data management system in an industry standard electronic format designated by the agency. The agency may not require training on the use of agency data management systems by persons or entities that choose to maintain data in their own data management system, provided that they electronically transmit required information in a format and frequency designated by the agency. Contracted persons and entities shall meet the minimum hardware and software technical requirements established by the agency for the use of such systems. Such persons or entities shall also meet any requirements established by the agency for training and professional development of staff providing direct services to clients. (3) Community-based services that are medically necessary to prevent institutionalization shall, to the extent of available resources, include: (a) Adult day training services. (b) Family care services. (c) Guardian advocate referral services. (d) Medical/dental services, except that medical services shall not be provided to clients with spina bifida except as specifically appropriated by the Legislature. (e) Parent training. (f) Personal care services. (g) Recreation. (h) Residential facility services. (i) Respite services. (j) Social services. (k) Specialized therapies. (l) Supported employment. (m) Supported living. (n) Training, including behavioral analysis services. (o) Transportation. (p) Other habilitative and rehabilitative services as needed. (4) The agency shall utilize the services of private businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and units of local government whenever such services are more cost-efficient than such services provided directly by the department, including arrangements for provision of residential facilities. (5) In order to improve the potential for utilization of more cost-effective, community-based residential facilities, the agency shall promote the statewide development of day habilitation services for clients who live with a direct service provider in a community-based residential facility and who do not require 24-hour-a-day care in a hospital or other health care institution, but who may, in the absence of day habilitation services, require admission to a developmental disabilities center. Each day service facility shall provide a protective physical environment for clients, ensure that direct service providers meet minimum screening standards as required in s. 393.0655, make available to all day habilitation service participants at least one meal on each day of operation, provide facilities to enable participants to obtain needed rest while attending the program, as appropriate, and provide social and educational activities designed to stimulate interest and provide socialization skills. (6) To promote independence and productivity, the agency shall provide supports and services, within available resources, to assist clients enrolled in Medicaid waivers who choose to pursue gainful employment. (7) For the purpose of making needed community-based residential facilities available at the least possible cost to the state, the agency is authorized to lease privately owned residential facilities under long-term rental agreements, if such rental agreements are projected to be less costly to the state over the useful life of the facility than state purchase or state construction of such a facility. (8) The agency may adopt rules providing definitions, eligibility criteria, and procedures for the purchase of services provided pursuant to this section. 1 (9) The Agency for Health Care Administration shall amend the Florida Medicaid Developmental Disabilities Individual Budgeting Waiver Services Provider Rate Table to establish a monthly reimbursement rate, effective October 1, 2025, for Life Skills Development Levels 3 and 4 services provided to recipients who attend such services for at least 16 days during a calendar month. Providers shall continue to be reimbursed at the existing hourly rate for recipients who attend fewer than 16 days during the calendar month. The agency shall develop a methodology to monitor and evaluate the fiscal impact of the revised reimbursement methodology and shall submit quarterly reports to the chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, the chair of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, and the Executive Office of the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget detailing the fiscal impacts realized.

Section 32, ch. 2025-199, provides that “[t]he amendments to s. 393.066(2) and (9), Florida Statutes, made by this act expire July 1, 2026, and the text of those subsections shall revert to that in existence on June 30, 2025, except that any amendments to such text enacted other than by this act shall be preserved and continue to operate to the extent that such amendments are not dependent upon the portions of text which expire pursuant to this section.” Effective July 1, 2026, subsection (9) expires, and subsection (2), as amended by s. 32, ch. 2025-199, will read: (2) Necessary services shall be purchased, rather than provided directly by the agency, when the purchase of services is more cost-efficient than providing them directly.

      "heading": "Receivership proceedings.",
      "text": "393.0678 Receivership proceedings.— (1) The agency may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver for a residential habilitation center or a group home facility owned and operated by a corporation or partnership when any of the following conditions exist: (a) Any person is operating a facility without a license and refuses to make application for a license as required by s. 393.067. (b) The licensee is closing the facility or has informed the agency that it intends to close the facility, and adequate arrangements have not been made for relocation of the residents within 7 days, exclusive of weekends and holidays, of the closing of the facility. (c) The agency determines that conditions exist in the facility which present an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the facility or which present a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm would result therefrom. Whenever possible, the agency shall facilitate the continued operation of the program. (d) The licensee cannot meet its financial obligations to provide food, shelter, care, and utilities. Evidence such as the issuance of bad checks or the accumulation of delinquent bills for such items as personnel salaries, food, drugs, or utilities constitutes prima facie evidence that the ownership of the facility lacks the financial ability to operate the home in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and all rules adopted thereunder. (2)(a) The petition for receivership shall take precedence over other court business unless the court determines that some other pending proceeding, having similar statutory precedence, has priority. (b) A hearing shall be conducted within 5 days of the filing of the petition, at which time all interested parties shall have the opportunity to present evidence pertaining to the petition. The agency shall notify the owner or operator of the facility named in the petition of its filing and the date set for the hearing. (c) The court shall grant the petition only upon finding that the health, safety, or welfare of residents of the facility would be threatened if a condition existing at the time the petition was filed is permitted to continue. A receiver may not be appointed ex parte unless the court determines that one or more of the conditions in subsection (1) exist; that the facility owner or operator cannot be found; that all reasonable means of locating the owner or operator and notifying him or her of the petition and hearing have been exhausted; or that the owner or operator after notification of the hearing chooses not to attend. After such findings, the court may appoint any person qualified by education, training, or experience to carry out the responsibilities of receiver pursuant to this section, except that the court may not appoint any owner or affiliate of the facility which is in receivership. Before the appointment as receiver of a person who is the operator, manager, or supervisor of another facility, the court shall determine that the person can reasonably operate, manage, or supervise more than one facility. The receiver may be appointed for up to 90 days with the option of petitioning the court for 30-day extensions. The receiver may be selected from a list of persons qualified to act as receivers developed by the agency and presented to the court with each petition for receivership. Under no circumstances may the agency or designated agency employee be appointed as a receiver for more than 60 days; however, the agency receiver may petition the court for 30-day extensions. The court shall grant an extension upon a showing of good cause. The agency may petition the court to appoint a substitute receiver. (d) During the first 60 days of the receivership, the agency may not take action to decertify or revoke the license of a facility unless conditions causing imminent danger to the health and welfare of the residents exist and a receiver has been unable to remove those conditions. After the first 60 days of receivership, and every 60 days thereafter until the receivership is terminated, the agency shall submit to the court the results of an assessment of the ability of the facility to assure the safety and care of the residents. If the conditions at the facility or the intentions of the owner indicate that the purpose of the receivership is to close the facility rather than to facilitate its continued operation, the agency shall place the residents in appropriate alternate residential settings as quickly as possible. If, in the opinion of the court, the agency has not been diligent in its efforts to make adequate arrangements for placement, the court shall find the agency to be in contempt and shall order the agency to submit its plans for moving the residents. (3) The receiver shall make provisions for the continued health, safety, and welfare of all residents of the facility and: (a) Shall exercise those powers and perform those duties set out by the court. (b) Shall operate the facility in such a manner as to assure the residents’ safety and adequate health care for the residents. (c) Shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to protect or conserve the assets or property of the facility for which the receiver is appointed, or the proceeds from any transfer thereof, and may use them only in the performance of the powers and duties set forth in this section and by order of the court. (d) Shall honor all leases, mortgages, and secured transactions governing the building in which the facility is located and all goods and fixtures in the building of which the receiver has taken possession, but only to the extent of payments which, in the case of a rental agreement, are for the use of the property during the period of the receivership or which, in the case of a purchase agreement, become due during the period of the receivership. (e) May use the building, fixtures, furnishings, and any accompanying consumable goods in the provision of care and services to residents and to any other persons receiving services from the facility at the time the petition for receivership was filed. The receiver shall collect payments for all goods and services provided to residents or others during the period of the receivership at the same rate of payment charged by the owner at the time the petition for receivership was filed, or at a fair and reasonable rate otherwise approved by the court for private, paying residents. The receiver may apply to the agency for a rate increase for residents under Title XIX of the Social Security Act if the facility is not receiving the state reimbursement cap and if expenditures justify an increase in the rate. (f) May correct or eliminate any deficiency in the structure, furnishings, or staffing of the facility which endangers the safety or health of residents while they remain in the facility, provided the total cost of correction does not exceed $3,000. The court may order expenditures for this purpose in excess of $3,000 on application from the receiver after notice to the owner. A hearing may be requested by the owner within 72 hours. (g) May let contracts and hire agents and employees to carry out the powers and duties of the receiver under this section. (h) Shall have full power to direct, manage, hire, and discharge employees of the facility subject to any contract rights they may have. The receiver shall hire and pay employees at the rate of compensation, including benefits, approved by the court. Receivership does not relieve the owner of any obligations to employees which had been made before the appointment of a receiver and were not carried out by the receiver. (i) Shall be entitled to take possession of all property or assets of residents which are in the possession of a facility or its owner. The receiver shall preserve all such property or assets and all resident records of which the receiver takes possession; and he or she shall provide for the prompt transfer of the property, assets, and records of any resident transferred to the resident’s new placement. An inventory list certified by the owner and receiver shall be made at the time the receiver takes possession of the facility. (4)(a) A person who is served with notice of an order of the court appointing a receiver and of the receiver’s name and address shall be liable to pay the receiver for any goods or services provided by the receiver after the date of the order if the person would have been liable for the goods or services had they been supplied by the owner. The receiver shall give a receipt for each payment and shall keep a copy of each receipt on file. The receiver shall deposit accounts received in a separate account and shall use this account for all disbursements. (b) The receiver may bring an action to enforce the liability created by paragraph (a). (c) A payment to the receiver of any sum owing to the facility or its owner discharges any obligation to the facility to the extent of the payment. (5)(a) A receiver may petition the court that he or she not be required to honor any lease, mortgage, secured transaction, or other wholly or partially executory contract entered into by the owner of the facility if the rent, price, or rate of interest required to be paid under the agreement was substantially in excess of a reasonable rent, price, or rate of interest at the time the contract was entered into, or if any material provision of the agreement was unreasonable, when compared to contracts negotiated under similar conditions. Any relief in this form provided by the court shall be limited to the life of the receivership, unless otherwise determined by the court. (b) If the receiver is in possession of real estate or goods subject to a lease, mortgage, or security interest which the receiver has obtained a court order to avoid under paragraph (a), and if the real estate or goods are necessary for the continued operation of the facility under this section, the receiver may apply to the court to set a reasonable rental, price, or rate of interest to be paid by the receiver during the duration of the receivership. The court shall hold a hearing on the application within 15 days. The receiver shall send notice of the application to any known persons who own the property involved or to the mortgage holders at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The payment by the receiver of the amount determined by the court to be reasonable is a defense to any action brought against the receiver by any person who received such notice, which action is for payment or for possession of the goods or real estate subject to the lease, mortgage, or security interest involved; but the payment does not relieve the owner of the facility of any liability for the difference between the amount paid by the receiver and the amount due under the original lease, mortgage, or security interest involved. (6) The court shall set the compensation of the receiver, which shall be considered a necessary expense of the receivership. (7) The court may require a receiver to post a bond. (8) A receiver may be held liable in a personal capacity only for the receiver’s own gross negligence, intentional acts, or breach of fiduciary duty. (9) The court may terminate a receivership when: (a) The court determines that the receivership no longer is necessary because the conditions which gave rise to the receivership no longer exist; or (b) All of the residents in the facility have been transferred or discharged. (10) Within 30 days after termination of the receivership, unless this time period is extended by the court, the receiver shall give the court a complete accounting of all property of which the receiver has taken possession, of all funds collected and disbursed, and of the expenses of the receivership. (11) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to relieve any owner, operator, or employee of a facility placed in receivership of any civil or criminal liability incurred, or any duty imposed by law, by reason of acts or omissions of the owner, operator, or employee before the appointment of a receiver; nor shall anything contained in this section be construed to suspend during the receivership any obligation of the owner, operator, or employee for payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance expenses of the facility or any obligation of the owner, operator, or employee or any other person for the payment of mortgages or liens. The owner shall retain the right to sell or mortgage any facility under receivership, subject to the approval of the court which ordered the receivership. A receivership imposed under the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to the Health Care Trust Fund pursuant to s. 400.063. The owner of a facility placed in receivership by the court shall be liable for all expenses and costs incurred by the Health Care Trust Fund which occur as a result of the receivership.

Services and support available to families and individuals with developmental disabilities shall emphasize community living and self-determination and enable individuals with developmental disabilities to enjoy typical lifestyles. One way to accomplish this is to recognize that families are the greatest resource available to individuals who have developmental disabilities and must be supported in their role as primary care givers. (2) Services and support authorized under the family care program shall, to the extent of available resources, include the services listed under s. 393.066 and, in addition, shall include, but not be limited to: (a) Attendant care. (b) Barrier-free modifications to the home. (c) Home visitation by agency workers. (d) In-home subsidies. (e) Low-interest loans.

(3) When it is determined by the agency to be more cost-effective and in the best interest of the client to maintain such client in the home of a direct service provider, the parent or guardian of the client or, if competent, the client may enroll the client in the family care program. The direct service provider of a client enrolled in the family care program shall be reimbursed according to a rate schedule set by the agency, except that in-home subsidies shall be provided in accordance with s. 393.0695. (4) All existing community resources available to the client shall be utilized to support program objectives. Additional services may be incorporated into the program as appropriate and to the extent that resources are available. The agency is authorized to accept gifts and grants in order to carry out the program. (5) The agency may contract for the provision of any portion of the services required by the program, except for in-home subsidies, which shall be provided pursuant to s. 393.0695 whenever the services so provided are more cost-efficient than those provided by the agency. (6) When possible, services shall be obtained under the “Florida Comprehensive Annual Services Program Plan under Title XX of the Social Security Act” and the “Florida Plan for Medical Assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.” (7) To provide a range of personal care services for the client, the use of volunteers shall be maximized. The agency shall assure appropriate insurance coverage to protect volunteers from personal liability while acting within the scope of their volunteer assignments under the program.

In-home subsidies may not be used to pay a contractor for the provision of services and supports to the client or to pay for medical or dental services, medicines, medical supplies, or adaptive equipment or aids. (3) In-home subsidies must be based on an individual determination of need and must not exceed maximum amounts set by the agency and reassessed by the agency quarterly. (4) Payments may be made monthly and shall be considered a client service rather than a purchase of service. Chapter 287 does not apply to in-home subsidies.

      "text": "393.11 Involuntary admission to residential services.— (1) JURISDICTION.—If a person has an intellectual disability or autism and requires involuntary admission to residential services provided by the agency, the circuit court of the county in which the person resides has jurisdiction to conduct a hearing and enter an order involuntarily admitting the person in order for the person to receive the care, treatment, habilitation, and rehabilitation that the person needs. For the purpose of identifying intellectual disability or autism, diagnostic capability shall be established by the agency. Except as otherwise specified, the proceedings under this section are governed by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. (2) PETITION.— (a) A petition for involuntary admission to residential services may be executed by a petitioning commission. (b) The petitioning commission shall consist of three persons. One of these persons shall be a physician licensed and practicing under chapter 458 or chapter 459. (c) The petition shall be verified and must: 1. State the name, age, and present address of the commissioners and their relationship to the person who has an intellectual disability or autism; 2. State the name, age, county of residence, and present address of the person who has an intellectual disability or autism; 3. Allege that the commission believes that the person needs involuntary residential services and specify the factual information on which the belief is based; 4. Allege that the person lacks sufficient capacity to give express and informed consent to a voluntary application for services and lacks the basic survival and self-care skills to provide for the person’s well-being or is likely to physically injure others if allowed to remain at liberty; and 5. State which residential setting is the least restrictive and most appropriate alternative and specify the factual information on which the belief is based. (d) The petition must be filed in the circuit court of the county in which the person who has the intellectual disability or autism resides. (3) NOTICE.— (a) Notice of the filing of the petition shall be given to the individual and his or her legal guardian. The notice shall be given both verbally and in writing in the language of the client, or in other modes of communication of the client, and in English. Notice shall also be given to such other persons as the court may direct. The petition for involuntary admission to residential services shall be served with the notice. (b) If a motion or petition has been filed pursuant to s. 916.303 to dismiss criminal charges against a defendant who has an intellectual disability or autism, and a petition is filed to involuntarily admit the defendant to residential services under this section, the notice of the filing of the petition must also be given to the defendant’s attorney, the state attorney of the circuit from which the defendant was committed, and the agency. (c) The notice must state that a hearing shall be set to inquire into the need of the person who has an intellectual disability or autism for involuntary residential services. The notice must also state the date of the hearing on the petition. (d) The notice must state that the individual who has an intellectual disability or autism has the right to be represented by counsel of his or her own choice and that, if the person cannot afford an attorney, the court shall appoint one. (4) AGENCY PARTICIPATION.— (a) Upon receiving the petition, the court shall immediately order the agency to examine the person being considered for involuntary admission to residential services. (b) Following examination, the agency shall file a written report with the court at least 10 working days before the date of the hearing. The report must be served on the petitioner, the person who has the intellectual disability or autism, and the person’s attorney at the time the report is filed with the court. (c) The report must contain the findings of the agency’s evaluation, any recommendations deemed appropriate, and a determination of whether the person is eligible for services under this chapter. (5) EXAMINING COMMITTEE.— (a) Upon receiving the petition, the court shall immediately appoint an examining committee to examine the person being considered for involuntary admission to residential services provided by the agency. (b) The court shall appoint at least three disinterested experts who have demonstrated to the court an expertise in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of persons who have intellectual disabilities or autism. The committee must include at least one licensed and qualified physician, one licensed and qualified psychologist, and one qualified professional who, at a minimum, has a master’s degree in social work, special education, or vocational rehabilitation counseling, to examine the person and to testify at the hearing on the involuntary admission to residential services. (c) Counsel for the person who is being considered for involuntary admission to residential services and counsel for the petition commission has the right to challenge the qualifications of those appointed to the examining committee. (d) Members of the committee may not be employees of the agency or be associated with each other in practice or in employer-employee relationships. Members of the committee may not have served as members of the petitioning commission. Members of the committee may not be employees of the members of the petitioning commission or be associated in practice with members of the commission. (e) The committee shall prepare a written report for the court. The report must explicitly document the extent that the person meets the criteria for involuntary admission. The report, and expert testimony, must include, but not be limited to: 1. The degree of the person’s intellectual disability or autism and whether, using diagnostic capabilities established by the agency, the person is eligible for agency services; 2. Whether, because of the person’s degree of intellectual disability or autism, the person: a. Lacks sufficient capacity to give express and informed consent to a voluntary application for services pursuant to s. 393.065 and lacks basic survival and self-care skills to such a degree that close supervision and habilitation in a residential setting is necessary and, if not provided, would result in a threat of substantial harm to the person’s well-being; or b. Is likely to physically injure others if allowed to remain at liberty. 3. The purpose to be served by residential care; 4. A recommendation on the type of residential placement which would be the most appropriate and least restrictive for the person; and 5. The appropriate care, habilitation, and treatment. (f) The committee shall file the report with the court at least 10 working days before the date of the hearing. The report must be served on the petitioner, the person who has the intellectual disability or autism, the person’s attorney at the time the report is filed with the court, and the agency. (g) Members of the examining committee shall receive a reasonable fee to be determined by the court. The fees shall be paid from the general revenue fund of the county in which the person who has the intellectual disability or autism resided when the petition was filed. (6) COUNSEL; GUARDIAN AD LITEM.— (a) The person who has the intellectual disability or autism must be represented by counsel at all stages of the judicial proceeding. If the person is indigent and cannot afford counsel, the court shall appoint a public defender at least 20 working days before the scheduled hearing. The person’s counsel shall have full access to the records of the service provider and the agency. In all cases, the attorney shall represent the rights and legal interests of the person, regardless of who initiates the proceedings or pays the attorney fee. (b) If the attorney, during the course of his or her representation, reasonably believes that the person who has the intellectual disability or autism cannot adequately act in his or her own interest, the attorney may seek the appointment of a guardian ad litem. A prior finding of incompetency is not required before a guardian ad litem is appointed pursuant to this section. (7) HEARING.— (a) The hearing for involuntary admission shall be conducted, and the order shall be entered, in the county in which the petition is filed. The hearing shall be conducted in a physical setting not likely to be injurious to the person’s condition. (b) A hearing on the petition must be held as soon as practicable after the petition is filed, but reasonable delay for the purpose of investigation, discovery, or procuring counsel or witnesses shall be granted. (c) The court may appoint a general or special magistrate to preside. Except as otherwise specified, the magistrate’s proceeding shall be governed by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. (d) The person who has the intellectual disability or autism must be physically present throughout the entire proceeding. If the person’s attorney believes that the person’s presence at the hearing is not in his or her best interest, the person’s presence may be waived once the court has seen the person and the hearing has commenced. (e) The person has the right to present evidence and to cross-examine all witnesses and other evidence alleging the appropriateness of the person’s admission to residential care. Other relevant and material evidence regarding the appropriateness of the person’s admission to residential services; the most appropriate, least restrictive residential placement; and the appropriate care, treatment, and habilitation of the person, including written or oral reports, may be introduced at the hearing by any interested person. (f) The petitioning commission may be represented by counsel at the hearing. The petitioning commission shall have the right to call witnesses, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and present argument on behalf of the petitioning commission. (g) All evidence shall be presented according to chapter 90. The burden of proof shall be on the party alleging the appropriateness of the person’s admission to residential services. The burden of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence. (h) All stages of each proceeding shall be stenographically reported. (8) ORDER.— (a) In all cases, the court shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision. The order must state the basis for the findings of fact. (b) An order of involuntary admission to residential services may not be entered unless the court finds that: 1. The person is intellectually disabled or autistic; 2. Placement in a residential setting is the least restrictive and most appropriate alternative to meet the person’s needs; and 3. Because of the person’s degree of intellectual disability or autism, the person: a. Lacks sufficient capacity to give express and informed consent to a voluntary application for services pursuant to s. 393.065 and lacks basic survival and self-care skills to such a degree that close supervision and habilitation in a residential setting is necessary and, if not provided, would result in a real and present threat of substantial harm to the person’s well-being; or b. Is likely to physically injure others if allowed to remain at liberty. (c) If the evidence presented to the court is not sufficient to warrant involuntary admission to residential services, but the court feels that residential services would be beneficial, the court may recommend that the person seek voluntary admission. (d) If an order of involuntary admission to residential services provided by the agency is entered by the court, a copy of the written order shall be served upon the person, the person’s counsel, the agency, and the state attorney and the person’s defense counsel, if applicable. The order of involuntary admission sent to the agency shall also be accompanied by a copy of the examining committee’s report and other reports contained in the court file. (e) Upon receiving the order, the agency shall, within 45 days, provide the court with a copy of the person’s family or individual support plan and copies of all examinations and evaluations, outlining the treatment and rehabilitative programs. The agency shall document that the person has been placed in the most appropriate, least restrictive and cost-beneficial residential setting. A copy of the family or individual support plan and other examinations and evaluations shall be served upon the person and the person’s counsel at the same time the documents are filed with the court. (9) EFFECT OF THE ORDER OF INVOLUNTARY ADMISSION TO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES.— (a) An order authorizing an admission to residential care may not be considered an adjudication of mental incompetency. A person is not presumed incompetent solely by reason of the person’s involuntary admission to residential services. A person may not be denied the full exercise of all legal rights guaranteed to citizens of this state and of the United States. (b) Any minor involuntarily admitted to residential services shall, upon reaching majority, be given a hearing to determine the continued appropriateness of his or her involuntary admission. (10) COMPETENCY.— (a) The issue of competency is separate and distinct from a determination of the appropriateness of involuntary admission to residential services due to intellectual disability or autism. (b) The issue of the competency of a person who has an intellectual disability or autism for purposes of assigning guardianship shall be determined in a separate proceeding according to the procedures and requirements of chapter 744. The issue of the competency of a person who has an intellectual disability or autism for purposes of determining whether the person is competent to proceed in a criminal trial shall be determined in accordance with chapter 916. (11) CONTINUING JURISDICTION.—The court which issues the initial order for involuntary admission to residential services under this section has continuing jurisdiction to enter further orders to ensure that the person is receiving adequate care, treatment, habilitation, and rehabilitation, including psychotropic medication and behavioral programming. Upon request, the court may transfer the continuing jurisdiction to the court where a client resides if it is different from where the original involuntary admission order was issued. A person may not be released from an order for involuntary admission to residential services except by the order of the court. (12) APPEAL.— (a) Any party to the proceeding who is affected by an order of the court, including the agency, may appeal to the appropriate district court of appeal within the time and in the manner prescribed by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. (b) The filing of an appeal by the person who has an intellectual disability or autism stays admission of the person into residential care. The stay remains in effect during the pendency of all review proceedings in Florida courts until a mandate issues. (13) HABEAS CORPUS.—At any time and without notice, any person involuntarily admitted into residential care, or the person’s parent or legal guardian in his or her behalf, is entitled to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to question the cause, legality, and appropriateness of the person’s involuntary admission. Each person, or the person’s parent or legal guardian, shall receive specific written notice of the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus at the time of his or her involuntary placement. (14) REVIEW OF CONTINUED INVOLUNTARY ADMISSION TO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES.— (a) If a person is involuntarily admitted to residential services provided by the agency, the agency shall employ or, if necessary, contract with a qualified evaluator to conduct a review annually, unless otherwise ordered, to determine the propriety of the person’s continued involuntary admission to residential services based on the criteria in paragraph (8)(b). The review shall include an assessment of the most appropriate and least restrictive type of residential placement for the person. (b) A placement resulting from an involuntary admission to residential services must be reviewed by the court at a hearing annually, unless a shorter review period is ordered at a previous hearing. The agency shall provide to the court the completed reviews by the qualified evaluator. The review and hearing must determine whether the person continues to meet the criteria in paragraph (8)(b) and, if so, whether the person still requires involuntary placement in a residential setting and whether the person is receiving adequate care, treatment, habilitation, and rehabilitation in the residential setting. (c) The agency shall provide a copy of the review and reasonable notice of the hearing to the appropriate state attorney, if applicable, the person’s attorney, and the person’s guardian or guardian advocate, if appointed. (d) For purposes of this section, the term “qualified evaluator” means a psychiatrist licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459, or a psychologist licensed under chapter 490, who has demonstrated to the court an expertise in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of persons who have intellectual disabilities.

      "text": "393.13 Treatment of persons with developmental disabilities.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section shall be known as “The Bill of Rights of Persons with Developmental Disabilities.” (2) LEGISLATIVE INTENT.— (a) The Legislature finds and declares that the system of care provided to individuals with developmental disabilities must be designed to meet the needs of the clients as well as protect the integrity of their legal and human rights. (b) The Legislature further finds and declares that the design and delivery of treatment and services to persons with developmental disabilities should be directed by the principles of self-determination and therefore should: 1. Abate the use of large institutions. 2. Continue the development of community-based services that provide reasonable alternatives to institutionalization in settings that are least restrictive to the client and that provide opportunities for inclusion in the community. 3. Provide training and education that will maximize their potential to lead independent and productive lives and that will afford opportunities for outward mobility from institutions. 4. Reduce the use of sheltered workshops and other noncompetitive employment day activities and promote opportunities for those who choose to seek such employment. (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that duplicative and unnecessary administrative procedures and practices shall be eliminated, and areas of responsibility shall be clearly defined and consolidated in order to economically utilize present resources. Furthermore, personnel providing services should be sufficiently qualified and experienced to meet the needs of the clients, and they must be sufficient in number to provide treatment in a manner which is beneficial to the clients. (d) It is the intent of the Legislature: 1. To articulate the existing legal and human rights of persons with developmental disabilities so that they may be exercised and protected. Persons with developmental disabilities shall have all the rights enjoyed by citizens of the state and the United States. 2. To provide a mechanism for the identification, evaluation, and treatment of persons with developmental disabilities. 3. To divert those individuals from institutional commitment who, by virtue of comprehensive assessment, can be placed in less costly, more effective community environments and programs. 4. To fund improvements in the program in accordance with the availability of state resources and yearly priorities determined by the Legislature. 5. To ensure that persons with developmental disabilities receive treatment and habilitation which fosters the developmental potential of the individual. 6. To provide programs for the proper habilitation and treatment of persons with developmental disabilities which shall include, but not be limited to, comprehensive medical/dental care, education, recreation, specialized therapies, training, social services, transportation, guardianship, family care programs, day habilitation services, and habilitative and rehabilitative services suited to the needs of the individual regardless of age, degree of disability, or handicapping condition. It is the intent of the Legislature that no person with developmental disabilities shall be deprived of these enumerated services by reason of inability to pay. 7. To fully effectuate the principles of self-determination through the establishment of community services for persons with developmental disabilities as a viable and practical alternative to institutional care at each stage of individual life development and to promote opportunities for community inclusion. If care in a residential facility becomes necessary, it shall be in the least restrictive setting. 8. To minimize and achieve an ongoing reduction in the use of restraint and seclusion in facilities and programs serving persons with developmental disabilities. (e) It is the clear, unequivocal intent of this act to guarantee individual dignity, liberty, pursuit of happiness, and protection of the civil and legal rights of persons with developmental disabilities. (3) RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.—The rights described in this subsection shall apply to all persons with developmental disabilities, whether or not such persons are clients of the agency. (a) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to dignity, privacy, and humane care, including the right to be free from abuse, including sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation. (b) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have the right to religious freedom and practice. Nothing shall restrict or infringe on a person’s right to religious preference and practice. (c) Persons with developmental disabilities shall receive services, within available sources, which protect the personal liberty of the individual and which are provided in the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purpose of treatment. (d) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to participate in an appropriate program of quality education and training services, within available resources, regardless of chronological age or degree of disability. Such persons may be provided with instruction in sex education, marriage, and family planning. (e) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to social interaction and to participate in community activities. (f) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to physical exercise and recreational opportunities. (g) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to be free from harm, including unnecessary physical, chemical, or mechanical restraint, isolation, excessive medication, abuse, or neglect. (h) Persons with developmental disabilities shall have a right to consent to or refuse treatment, subject to the powers of a guardian advocate appointed pursuant to s. 393.12 or a guardian appointed pursuant to chapter 744. (i) No otherwise qualified person shall, by reason of having a developmental disability, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or activity which receives public funds, and all prohibitions set forth under any other statute shall be actionable under this statute. (j) No otherwise qualified person shall, by reason of having a developmental disability, be denied the right to vote in public elections. (4) CLIENT RIGHTS.—For purposes of this subsection, the term “client,” as defined in s. 393.063, shall also include any person served in a facility licensed under s. 393.067. (a) Clients shall have an unrestricted right to communication: 1. Each client is allowed to receive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence. A client’s incoming or outgoing correspondence may not be opened, delayed, held, or censored by the facility unless there is reason to believe that it contains items or substances which may be harmful to the client or others, in which case the chief administrator of the facility may direct reasonable examination of such mail and regulate the disposition of such items or substances. 2. Clients in residential facilities shall be afforded reasonable opportunities for telephone communication, to make and receive confidential calls, unless there is reason to believe that the content of the telephone communication may be harmful to the client or others, in which case the chief administrator of the facility may direct reasonable observation and monitoring to the telephone communication. 3. Clients have an unrestricted right to visitation subject to reasonable rules of the facility. However, this provision may not be construed to permit infringement upon other clients’ rights to privacy. (b) Each client has the right to the possession and use of his or her own clothing and personal effects, except in those specific instances where the use of some of these items as reinforcers is essential for training the client as part of an appropriately approved behavioral program. The chief administrator of the facility may take temporary custody of such effects when it is essential to do so for medical or safety reasons. Custody of such personal effects shall be promptly recorded in the client’s record, and a receipt for such effects shall be immediately given to the client, if competent, or the client’s parent or legal guardian. 1. All money belonging to a client held by the agency shall be held in compliance with s. 402.17(2). 2. All interest on money received and held for the personal use and benefit of a client shall be the property of that client and may not accrue to the general welfare of all clients or be used to defray the cost of residential care. Interest so accrued shall be used or conserved for the personal use or benefit of the individual client as provided in s. 402.17(2). 3. Upon the discharge or death of a client, a final accounting shall be made of all personal effects and money belonging to the client held by the agency. All personal effects and money, including interest, shall be promptly turned over to the client or his or her heirs. (c) Each client shall receive prompt and appropriate medical treatment and care for physical and mental ailments and for the prevention of any illness or disability. Medical treatment shall be consistent with the accepted standards of medical practice in the community. 1. Medication shall be administered only at the written order of a physician. Medication shall not be used as punishment, for the convenience of staff, as a substitute for implementation of an individual or family support plan or behavior analysis services, or in unnecessary or excessive quantities. 2. Daily notation of medication received by each client in a residential facility shall be kept in the client’s record. 3. Periodically, but no less frequently than every 6 months, the drug regimen of each client in a residential facility shall be reviewed by the attending physician or other appropriate monitoring body, consistent with appropriate standards of medical practice. All prescriptions shall have a termination date. 4. When pharmacy services are provided at any residential facility, such services shall be directed or supervised by a professionally competent pharmacist licensed according to the provisions of chapter 465. 5. Pharmacy services shall be delivered in accordance with the provisions of chapter 465. 6. Prior to instituting a plan of experimental medical treatment or carrying out any necessary surgical procedure, express and informed consent shall be obtained from the client, if competent, or the client’s parent or legal guardian. Information upon which the client shall make necessary treatment and surgery decisions shall include, but not be limited to: a. The nature and consequences of such procedures. b. The risks, benefits, and purposes of such procedures. c. Alternate procedures available. 7. When the parent or legal guardian of the client is unknown or unlocatable and the physician is unwilling to perform surgery based solely on the client’s consent, a court of competent jurisdiction shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriateness of the surgical procedure. The client shall be physically present, unless the client’s medical condition precludes such presence, represented by counsel, and provided the right and opportunity to be confronted with, and to cross-examine, all witnesses alleging the appropriateness of such procedure. In such proceedings, the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence shall be on the party alleging the appropriateness of such procedures. The express and informed consent of a person described in subparagraph 6. may be withdrawn at any time, with or without cause, prior to treatment or surgery. 8. The absence of express and informed consent notwithstanding, a licensed and qualified physician may render emergency medical care or treatment to any client who has been injured or who is suffering from an acute illness, disease, or condition if, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, delay in initiation of emergency medical care or treatment would endanger the health of the client. (d) Each client shall have access to individual storage space for his or her private use. (e) Each client shall be provided with appropriate physical exercise as prescribed in the client’s individual or family support plan. Indoor and outdoor facilities and equipment for such physical exercise shall be provided. (f) Each client shall receive humane discipline. (g) A client may not be subjected to a treatment program to eliminate problematic or unusual behaviors without first being examined by a physician who in his or her best judgment determines that such behaviors are not organically caused. 1. Treatment programs involving the use of noxious or painful stimuli are prohibited. 2. All alleged violations of this paragraph shall be reported immediately to the chief administrator of the facility and the agency. A thorough investigation of each incident shall be conducted and a written report of the finding and results of the investigation shall be submitted to the chief administrator of the facility and the agency within 24 hours after the occurrence or discovery of the incident. 3. The agency shall adopt by rule a system for the oversight of behavioral programs. The system shall establish guidelines and procedures governing the design, approval, implementation, and monitoring of all behavioral programs involving clients. The system shall ensure statewide and local review by committees of professionals certified as behavior analysts pursuant to s. 393.17. No behavioral program shall be implemented unless reviewed according to the rules established by the agency under this section. (h) Clients shall have the right to be free from the unnecessary use of restraint or seclusion. Restraints shall be employed only in emergencies or to protect the client or others from imminent injury. Restraints may not be employed as punishment, for the convenience of staff, or as a substitute for a support plan. Restraints shall impose the least possible restrictions consistent with their purpose and shall be removed when the emergency ends. Restraints shall not cause physical injury to the client and shall be designed to allow the greatest possible comfort. 1. Daily reports on the employment of restraint or seclusion shall be made to the administrator of the facility or program licensed under this chapter, and a monthly compilation of such reports shall be relayed to the agency’s local area office. The monthly reports shall summarize all such cases of restraints, the type used, the duration of usage, and the reasons therefor. The area offices shall submit monthly summaries of these reports to the agency’s central office. 2. The agency shall adopt by rule standards and procedures relating to the use of restraint and seclusion. Such rules must be consistent with recognized best practices; prohibit inherently dangerous restraint or seclusion procedures; establish limitations on the use and duration of restraint and seclusion; establish measures to ensure the safety of clients and staff during an incident of restraint or seclusion; establish procedures for staff to follow before, during, and after incidents of restraint or seclusion, including individualized plans for the use of restraints or seclusion in emergency situations; establish professional qualifications of and training for staff who may order or be engaged in the use of restraint or seclusion; establish requirements for facility data collection and reporting relating to the use of restraint and seclusion; and establish procedures relating to the documentation of the use of restraint or seclusion in the client’s facility or program record. A copy of the rules adopted under this subparagraph shall be given to the client, parent, guardian or guardian advocate, and all staff members of facilities and programs licensed under this chapter and made a part of all staff preservice and inservice training programs. (i) Each client shall have a central record. The central record shall be established by the agency at the time that an individual is determined eligible for services, shall be maintained by the client’s support coordinator, and must contain information pertaining to admission, diagnosis and treatment history, present condition, and such other information as may be required. The central record is the property of the agency. 1. Unless waived by the client, if competent, or the client’s parent or legal guardian if the client is incompetent, the client’s central record shall be confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1), and no part of it shall be released except: a. The record may be released to physicians, attorneys, and government agencies having need of the record to aid the client, as designated by the client, if competent, or the client’s parent or legal guardian, if the client is incompetent. b. The record shall be produced in response to a subpoena or released to persons authorized by order of court, excluding matters privileged by other provisions of law. c. The record or any part thereof may be disclosed to a qualified researcher, a staff member of the facility where the client resides, or an employee of the agency when the administrator of the facility or the director of the agency deems it necessary for the treatment of the client, maintenance of adequate records, compilation of treatment data, or evaluation of programs. d. Information from the records may be used for statistical and research purposes if the information is abstracted in such a way to protect the identity of individuals. 2. The client, if competent, or the client’s parent or legal guardian if the client is incompetent, shall be supplied with a copy of the client’s central record upon request. (j) Each client residing in a residential facility who is eligible to vote in public elections according to the laws of the state has the right to vote. Facilities operators shall arrange the means to exercise the client’s right to vote. (5) LIABILITY FOR VIOLATIONS.—Any person who violates or abuses any rights or privileges of persons with developmental disabilities provided by this chapter is liable for damages as determined by law. Any person who acts in good faith compliance with the provisions of this chapter is immune from civil or criminal liability for actions in connection with evaluation, admission, habilitative programming, education, treatment, or discharge of a client. However, this section does not relieve any person from liability if the person is guilty of negligence, misfeasance, nonfeasance, or malfeasance. (6) NOTICE OF RIGHTS.—Each person with developmental disabilities, if competent, or parent or legal guardian of such person if the person is incompetent, shall promptly receive from the agency or the Department of Education a written copy of this act. Each person with developmental disabilities able to comprehend shall be promptly informed, in the language or other mode of communication which such person understands, of the above legal rights of persons with developmental disabilities. (7) RESIDENT GOVERNMENT.—Each residential facility providing services to clients who are desirous and capable of participating shall initiate and develop a program of resident government to hear the views and represent the interests of all clients served by the facility. The resident government shall be composed of residents elected by other residents, staff advisers skilled in the administration of community organizations, and, at the option of the resident government, representatives of advocacy groups for persons with developmental disabilities from the community.

      "text": "393.506 Administration of medication.— (1) An unlicensed direct service provider may supervise the self-administration of medication or may administer oral, transdermal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, inhaled, enteral, or topical prescription medications to a client if the unlicensed direct service provider meets the requirements of this section. This includes, but is not limited to, the subcutaneous administration of insulin and epinephrine through an insulin pen, epinephrine pen, or similar device designed for self-administration. (2) In order to supervise the self-administration of medication or to administer medications as provided in subsection (1), an unlicensed direct service provider must satisfactorily complete an initial training course conducted by an agency-approved trainer of not less than 6 hours in medication administration and be found competent to supervise the self-administration of medication by a client and to administer medication to a client in a safe and sanitary manner. (a) The competency of the unlicensed direct service provider to supervise and administer otic, transdermal, and topical medication must be assessed and validated using simulation during the initial training course, and need not be revalidated annually. (b) Competency must be validated initially and revalidated annually for oral, enteral, ophthalmic, rectal, and inhaled medication administration. The initial validation and annual revalidations of medication administration must be performed onsite with an actual client using the client’s actual medication and must include the validating practitioner personally observing the unlicensed direct service provider satisfactorily: 1. Supervising the oral, enteral, ophthalmic, rectal, or inhaled self-administration of medication by a client; and 2. Administering medication to a client by oral, enteral, ophthalmic, rectal, or inhaled medication routes. (c)1. An unlicensed direct service provider who completes the required initial training course and is validated in the oral or enteral route of medication administration is not required to retake the initial training course unless he or she fails to maintain annual validation in the oral or enteral route, in which case the provider must complete the initial 6-hour training course again and obtain all required validations before he or she may supervise the self-administration of medication by a client or administer medication to a client. 2. If the unlicensed direct service provider has already completed an initial training course of at least 4 hours and has a current validation for oral or enteral routes of medication administration on or before July 1, 2018, he or she is not required to complete the initial 6-hour training course. If for any reason the unlicensed direct service provider fails to meet the annual validation requirement for oral or enteral medication administration, or the annual inservice training requirement in subsection (4), the unlicensed direct service provider must satisfactorily complete the initial training course again and obtain all required validations before he or she may supervise the self-administration of medication by a client or administer medication to a client. 3. If an unlicensed direct service provider has completed an initial training course of at least 4 hours but has not obtained validation for otic, transdermal, or topical medication administration before July 1, 2018, that direct service provider must obtain validation before administering otic, transdermal, and topical medication, which may be performed through simulation. (3) Only an unlicensed direct service provider who has met the training requirements of this section and who has been validated as competent may administer medication to a client. In addition, a direct service provider who is not currently licensed to administer medication may supervise the self-administration of medication by a client or may administer medication to a client only if the client, or the client’s guardian or legal representative, has given his or her informed written consent. (4) An unlicensed direct service provider must annually and satisfactorily complete a 2-hour agency-developed inservice training course in medication administration and medication error prevention conducted by an agency-approved trainer. The inservice training course shall count toward annual inservice training hours required by agency rules or by the rules of the Agency for Health Care Administration. This subsection may not be construed to require an increase in the total number of hours required for annual inservice training for direct service providers. (5) The training, determination of competency, and initial and annual validations required in this section shall be conducted by a registered nurse licensed pursuant to chapter 464 or by a licensed practical nurse in accordance with the requirements of chapter 464. A physician licensed pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459 may validate or revalidate competency. (6) The agency shall establish by rule standards and procedures that an unlicensed direct service provider must follow when supervising the self-administration of medication by a client and when administering medication to a client. Such rules must, at a minimum, address qualification requirements for trainers, requirements for labeling medication, documentation and recordkeeping, the storage and disposal of medication, instructions concerning the safe administration of medication or supervision of self-administered medication, informed-consent requirements and records, and the training curriculum and validation procedures. The agency shall adopt rules to establish methods of enforcement to ensure compliance with this section.
