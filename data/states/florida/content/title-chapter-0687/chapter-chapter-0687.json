The rendering of financial advice by a creditor to a debtor; 2. The consultation by a creditor with a debtor; or 3. The agreement by a creditor to take certain actions, such as entering into a new credit agreement, forbearing from exercising remedies under prior credit agreements, or extending installments due under prior credit agreements.

(f) “Loan shark” means any person as defined herein who lends money unlawfully under subsection (2), subsection (3), or subsection (4). (g) “Loan sharking” means the act of any person as defined herein lending money unlawfully under subsection (2), subsection (3), or subsection (4).

(6) No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or producing any books, paper, or other document before any court upon any investigation, proceeding, or trial, for any violation of this section upon the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to convict him or her of a crime or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture, but no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he or she may so testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, and no testimony so given or produced shall be received against the person upon any criminal investigation or proceeding.

In such court proceedings, the office may apply for and on due showing be entitled to have issued, the court’s subpoena requiring the appearance of any defendant and his or her employees or agents, and the production of documents, books, and records that may appear necessary for the hearing of such petition, to testify or give evidence concerning the acts or conduct or things complained of in such application for injunction. (2) In addition to all other means provided by law for the enforcement of any temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction issued in such court proceedings, the court shall have the power and jurisdiction, upon application of the office, to impound and to appoint a receiver or administrator for the property, assets, and business of the defendant, including, but not limited to, the books, records, documents, and papers appertaining thereto. Such receiver or administrator, when appointed and qualified, shall have all powers and duties as to custody, collection, administration, winding up, and liquidation of said property and business as shall from time to time be conferred upon him or her by the court. In such action, the court may issue orders and decrees staying all pending suits and enjoining any further suits affecting the receiver’s or administrator’s custody or possession of the said property, assets, and business or, in its discretion, may, with the consent of the presiding judge of the circuit, require that all such suits be assigned to the circuit court judge appointing the said receiver or administrator. (3) In addition to any other remedies provided by this act, the office may apply to the court hearing this matter for an order of restitution whereby the defendants in such action shall be ordered to make restitution of those sums shown by the office to have been obtained by them in violation of any of the provisions of this act. Such restitution shall, at the option of the court, be payable to the administrator or receiver appointed pursuant to this section or directly to the persons whose assets were obtained in violation of this act.

      "text": "687.16 Florida Farmer Financial Protection Act.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Florida Farmer Financial Protection Act.” (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Agriculture producer” means a person or company authorized to do business in this state and engaged in the production of goods derived from plants or animals, including, but not limited to, the growing of crops, silviculture, animal husbandry, or the production of livestock or dairy products. (b) “Agritourism activity” has the same meaning as provided in s. 570.86. (c) “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of Agriculture. (d) “Company” means a for-profit organization, association, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company, including a wholly owned subsidiary, majority-owned subsidiary, parent company, or affiliate of those entities or business associations authorized to do business in this state. (e) “Denies or restricts” means refusing to provide services, terminating existing services, or restricting or burdening the scope or nature of services offered or provided. (f) “Discriminate in the provision of financial services” means to deny or restrict services and thereby decline to provide financial services. (g) “ESG factor” means any factor or consideration that is collateral to or not reasonably likely to affect or impact financial risk and includes the promotion, furtherance, or achievement of environmental, social, or political goals, objectives, or outcomes, which may include the agriculture producer’s greenhouse gas emissions, use of fossil-fuel-derived fertilizer, or use of fossil-fuel-powered machinery. (h) “Farm” means the land, buildings, support facilities, machinery, and other appurtenances used in the production of farm or aquaculture products. (i) “Financial institution” means a company defined under s. 655.005(1)(h) and (i), which has total assets of more than $100 million. A financial institution includes any affiliate as defined in s. 655.005(1)(a) or subsidiary company as defined in s. 655.005(1)(x), even if such affiliate or subsidiary company is also a financial institution. (j) “Financial service” means any product or service that is of a financial nature and is offered by a financial institution. (3) FINANCIAL DISCRIMINATION; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS.— (a) A financial institution may not discriminate in the provision of financial services to an agriculture producer based, in whole or in part, upon an ESG factor. (b) If a financial institution has made any ESG commitment related to agriculture, there is an inference that the institution’s denial or restriction of a financial service to an agriculture producer violates paragraph (a). (c) A financial institution may overcome the inference in paragraph (b) by demonstrating that its denial or restriction of a financial service was based solely on documented risk analysis, and not on any ESG factor. (4) ENFORCEMENT; COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.—The Attorney General, in consultation with the Office of Financial Regulation, is authorized to enforce subsection (3). Any violation of subsection (3) constitutes an unfair trade practice under part II of chapter 501, and the Attorney General is authorized to investigate and seek remedies as provided in general law. Actions for damages may be sought by an aggrieved party. History.—s. 75, ch. 2025-22.
