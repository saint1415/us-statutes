(b) Invest and reinvest the assets of the retirement trust fund in: 1. Time or savings accounts of a national bank, a state bank insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, or a savings and loan association insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a state or federal chartered credit union whose share accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. 2. Obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States. 3. Bonds issued by the State of Israel. 4. Bonds, stocks, or other evidences of indebtedness issued or guaranteed by a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state or organized territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, provided: a. The corporation is listed on any one or more of the recognized national stock exchanges or on the National Market System of the NASDAQ Stock Market and, in the case of bonds only, holds a rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service; and b. The board of trustees may not invest more than 5 percent of its assets in the common stock or capital stock of any one issuing company, nor shall the aggregate investment in any one issuing company exceed 5 percent of the outstanding capital stock of the company or the aggregate of its investments under this subparagraph at cost exceed 50 percent of the fund’s assets. This paragraph applies to all boards of trustees and participants. However, if a municipality has a duly enacted pension plan pursuant to, and in compliance with, s. 185.35 and the trustees desire to vary the investment procedures, the trustees of such plan shall request a variance of the investment procedures as outlined herein only through a municipal ordinance or special act of the Legislature; if a special act, or a municipality by ordinance adopted before July 1, 1998, permits a greater than 50-percent equity investment, such municipality is not required to comply with the aggregate equity investment provisions of this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section may not be construed to take away any preexisting legal authority to make equity investments that exceed the requirements of this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of trustees may invest up to 25 percent of plan assets in foreign securities on a market-value basis. The investment cap on foreign securities may not be revised, amended, repealed, or increased except as provided by general law. (c) Issue drafts upon the municipal police officers’ retirement trust fund pursuant to this act and rules prescribed by the board of trustees. All such drafts shall be consecutively numbered, be signed by the chair and secretary or by two individuals designated by the board who are subject to the same fiduciary standards as the board of trustees under this subsection, and state upon their faces the purposes for which the drafts are drawn. The city treasurer or other depository shall retain such drafts when paid, as permanent vouchers for disbursements made, and no money may otherwise be drawn from the fund. (d) Finally decide all claims to relief under the board’s rules and regulations and pursuant to the provisions of this act. (e) Convert into cash any securities of the fund. (f) Keep a complete record of all receipts and disbursements and of the board’s acts and proceedings. (2) Any and all acts and decisions shall be effectuated by vote of a majority of the members of the board; however, no trustee shall take part in any action in connection with his or her own participation in the fund, and no unfair discrimination shall be shown to any individual employee participating in the fund. (3) The secretary of the board of trustees shall keep a record of all persons receiving retirement payments under the provisions of this chapter, in which shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the pension shall cease to be paid. In this record, the secretary shall keep a list of all police officers employed by the municipality. The record shall show the name, address, and time of employment of such police officer and when he or she ceases to be employed by the municipality. (4) The sole and exclusive administration of, and the responsibilities for, the proper operation of the retirement trust fund and for making effective the provisions of this chapter are vested in the board of trustees; however, nothing herein shall empower a board of trustees to amend the provisions of a retirement plan without the approval of the municipality. The board of trustees shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for an actuarial valuation of the retirement trust fund and for checking the actual experience of the fund. (5)(a) At least once every 3 years, the board of trustees shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant who shall evaluate the performance of any existing professional money manager and shall make recommendations to the board of trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term. These recommendations shall be considered by the board of trustees at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The date, time, place, and subject of this meeting shall be advertised in the same manner as for any meeting of the board. (b) For the purpose of this subsection, the term “professionally qualified independent consultant” means a consultant who, based on education and experience, is professionally qualified to evaluate the performance of professional money managers, and who, at a minimum: 1. Provides his or her services on a flat-fee basis. 2. Is not associated in any manner with the money manager for the pension fund. 3. Makes calculations according to the American Banking Institute method of calculating time-weighted rates of return. All calculations must be made net of fees. 4. Has 3 or more years of experience working in the public sector. (6) To assist the board in meeting its responsibilities under this chapter, the board, if it so elects, may: (a) Employ independent legal counsel at the pension fund’s expense. (b) Employ an independent enrolled actuary, as defined in s. 185.02, at the pension fund’s expense. (c) Employ such independent professional, technical, or other advisers as it deems necessary at the pension fund’s expense. If the board chooses to use the municipality’s or special district’s legal counsel or actuary, or chooses to use any of the municipality’s other professional, technical, or other advisers, it must do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. (7) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(b) and as provided in s. 215.473, the board of trustees must identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any scrutinized company, as defined in that section, and proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in that company beginning January 1, 2010. The divestiture of any such security must be completed by September 10, 2010. The board and its named officers or investment advisors may not be deemed to have breached their fiduciary duty in any action taken to dispose of any such security, and the board shall have satisfactorily discharged the fiduciary duties of loyalty, prudence, and sole and exclusive benefit to the participants of the pension fund and their beneficiaries if the actions it takes are consistent with the duties imposed by s. 215.473, and the manner of the disposition, if any, is reasonable as to the means chosen. For the purposes of effecting compliance with that section, the pension fund shall designate terror-free plans that allocate their funds among securities not subject to divestiture. No person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the board of trustees or any employee, officer, director, or advisor of such pension fund based upon the divestiture of any security pursuant to this subsection.

(2) Individual policies shall be purchased only when a group insurance plan is not feasible. (3) Each application and policy shall designate the pension fund as owner of the policy. (4) Policies shall be written on an annual premium basis. (5) The type of policy shall be one which for the premium paid provides each individual with the maximum retirement benefit at his or her earliest statutory normal retirement age. (6) Death benefit, if any, should not exceed: (a) One hundred times the estimated normal monthly retirement income, based on the assumption that the present rate of compensation continues without change to normal retirement date, or (b) Twice the annual rate of compensation as of the date of termination of service, or (c) The single-sum value of the accrued deferred retirement income (beginning at normal retirement date) at date of termination of service, whichever is greatest. (7) An insurance plan may provide that the assignment of insurance contract to separating officer shall be at least equivalent to the return of the officer’s contributions used to purchase the contract. An assignment of contract discharges the municipality from all further obligation to the participant under the plan even though the cash value of such contract may be less than the employee’s contributions. (8) Provisions shall be made, either by issuance of separate policies, or otherwise, that the separating officer does not receive cash values and other benefits under the policies assigned to the officer which exceed the present value of his or her vested interest under the retirement plan, inclusive of the officer’s contribution to the plan; the contributions by the state shall not be exhausted faster merely because the method of funding adopted was through insurance companies. (9) The police officer shall have the right at any time to give the board of trustees written instructions designating the primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive death benefit or proceeds and the method of the settlement of the death benefit or proceeds, or requesting a change in the beneficiary, designation or method of settlement previously made, subject to the terms of the policy or policies on the officer’s life. Upon receipt of such written instructions, the board of trustees shall take the necessary steps to effectuate the designation or change of beneficiary or settlement option.

(b) Except as reduced or increased contributions are authorized by subsection (2), by the payment to the fund of 5 percent of the salary of each full-time police officer duly appointed and enrolled as a member of such police department, which 5 percent shall be deducted by the municipality from the compensation due to the police officer and paid over to the board of trustees of the retirement trust fund wherein such police officer is employed. No police officer shall have any right to the money so paid into the fund except as provided in this chapter. (c) By all fines and forfeitures imposed and collected from any police officer because of the violation of any rule adopted by the board of trustees. (d) By payment by the municipality or other sources of a sum equal to the normal cost and the amount required to fund any actuarial deficiency shown by an actuarial valuation conducted under part VII of chapter 112 after taking into account the amounts described in paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g) and the tax proceeds described in paragraph (a) which are used to fund benefits provided in a defined benefit plan component. (e) By all gifts, bequests and devises when donated to the fund. (f) By all accretions to the fund by way of interest or dividends on bank deposits or otherwise. (g) By all other sources of income now or hereafter authorized by law for the augmentation of such municipal police officers’ retirement trust fund. (2) Member contribution rates may be adjusted as follows: (a) The employing municipality, by local ordinance, may elect to make an employee’s contributions. However, under no circumstances may a municipality reduce the member contribution to less than one-half of 1 percent of salary. (b) Police officer member contributions may be increased by consent of the members’ collective bargaining representative or, if none, by majority consent of police officer members of the fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require adjustment of member contribution rates in effect on the date this act becomes a law, including rates that exceed 5 percent of salary, provided that such rates are at least one-half of 1 percent of salary.

Insurance companies that do not use the electronic database provided by the Department of Revenue or that do not exercise due diligence in applying the electronic database for tax years on or after January 1, 2006, are subject to a 0.5 percent penalty on the portion of the premium pertaining to any insured risk that is improperly assigned, whether assigned to an improper local taxing jurisdiction, not assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction when it should be assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction, or assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction when it should not be assigned to a local taxing jurisdiction. (b) Any insurance company that is obligated to report and remit the excise tax on commercial casualty insurance premiums imposed under s. 185.08 and is unable, after due diligence, to assign an insured property to a specific local taxing jurisdiction for purposes of complying with paragraph (a) shall remit the excise tax on commercial casualty insurance premiums using a methodology of apportionment in a manner consistent with the remittance for the 2004 calendar year. An insurance company which makes two contacts with the agent responsible for a commercial casualty insurance application for the purpose of verifying information on the application necessary for the assignment to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction shall be considered to have exercised due diligence. Any insurance company which complies with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be subject to the penalty provided in paragraph (a). (2)(a) The Department of Revenue shall, subject to legislative appropriation, create as soon as practical and feasible, and thereafter shall maintain, an electronic database that conforms to any format approved by the American National Standards Institute’s Accredited Standards Committee X12 and that designates for each street address and address range in the state, including any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the local taxing jurisdiction in which the street address and address range is located, and the appropriate code for each such participating local taxing jurisdiction, identified by one nationwide standard numeric code. The nationwide standard numeric code must contain the same number of numeric digits, and each digit or combination of digits must refer to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States and must be in a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission. Each address or address range must be provided in standard postal format, including the street number, street number range, street name, and zip code. Each year after the creation of the initial database, the Department of Revenue shall annually create and maintain a database for the current tax year. Each annual database must be calendar-year specific. (b)1. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall furnish to the Department of Revenue all information needed to create the electronic database as soon as practical and feasible. The information furnished to the Department of Revenue must specify an effective date. 2. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall furnish to the Department of Revenue all information needed to create and update the current year’s database, including changes in annexations, incorporations, and reorganizations and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries, as well as changes in eligibility to participate in the excise tax imposed under this chapter. The information must specify an effective date and must be furnished to the Department of Revenue by July 1 of the current year. 3. The Department of Revenue shall create and update the current year’s database in accordance with the information furnished by participating local taxing jurisdictions under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., as appropriate. To the extent practicable, the Department of Revenue shall post each new annual database on a website by September 1 of each year. Each participating local taxing jurisdiction shall have access to this website and, within 30 days thereafter, shall provide any corrections to the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall finalize the current year’s database and post it on a website by November 1 of the current year. If a dispute in jurisdictional boundaries cannot be resolved so that changes in boundaries may be included, as appropriate, in the database by November 1, the changes may not be retroactively included in the current year’s database and the boundaries will remain the same as in the previous year’s database. The finalized database must be used in assigning policies and premiums to the proper local taxing jurisdiction for the insurance premium tax return due on the following March 1 for the tax year 2005. For subsequent tax years, the finalized database must be used in assigning policies and premiums to the proper local taxing jurisdiction for the insurance premium tax return due for the tax year beginning on or after the January 1 following the website posting of the database. Information contained in the electronic database is conclusive for purposes of this chapter. The electronic database is not an order, a rule, or a policy of general applicability. 4. Each annual database must identify the additions, deletions, and other changes to the preceding version of the database. (3)(a) As used in this section, the term “due diligence” means the care and attention that is expected from and is ordinarily exercised by a reasonable and prudent person under the circumstances. (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an insurance company is exercising due diligence if the insurance company complies with the provisions of paragraph (1)(b) or if the insurance company assigns an insured’s premium to local taxing jurisdictions in accordance with the Department of Revenue’s annual database and with respect to such database: 1. Expends reasonable resources to accurately and reliably implement such method; 2. Maintains adequate internal controls to correctly include in its database of policyholders the location of the property insured, in the proper address format, so that matching with the department’s database is accurate; and 3. Corrects errors in the assignment of addresses to local taxing jurisdictions within 120 days after the insurance company discovers the errors. (4) There is annually appropriated from the moneys collected under this chapter and deposited in the Police and Firefighter’s Premium Tax Trust Fund an amount sufficient to pay the expenses of the Department of Revenue in administering this section, but not to exceed $50,000 annually, adjusted annually by the lesser of a 5- percent increase or the percentage of growth in the total collections. (5) The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules necessary to administer this section, including rules establishing procedures and forms. (6) Any insurer that is obligated to collect and remit the tax on casualty insurance imposed under s. 185.08 shall be held harmless from any liability, including, but not limited to, liability for taxes, interest, or penalties that would otherwise be due solely as a result of an assignment of an insured risk to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction, based on the collection and remission of the tax accruing before January 1, 2005, if the insurer collects and reports this tax consistent with filings for periods before January 1, 2005. Further, any insurer that is obligated to collect and remit the tax on casualty insurance imposed under this section is not subject to an examination under s. 624.316 or s. 624.3161 which would occur solely as a result of an assignment of an insured risk to an incorrect local taxing jurisdiction, based on the collection and remission of such tax accruing before January 1, 2005.

Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the city on or after the normal retirement date. In such event, for chapter plans and local law plans, payment of retirement income will be governed by the following provisions of this section: (1) The normal retirement date of each police officer will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the police officer has completed 10 or more years of creditable service and attained age 55 or completed 25 years of creditable service and attained age 52. (2)(a) The amount of the monthly retirement income payable to a police officer who retires on or after his or her normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of the police officer’s years of credited service multiplied by 2.75 percent of his or her average final compensation. (b) Effective July 1, 2015, a plan that is in compliance with this chapter except that the plan provides a benefit that is less than 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a police officer for all years of credited service or provides an effective benefit that is less than 2.75 percent as a result of a maximum benefit limitation: 1. Must maintain, at a minimum, the percentage amount or maximum benefit limitation in effect on July 1, 2015, and is not required to increase the benefit to 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a police officer for all years of credited service; or 2. If the plan changes the percentage amount or maximum benefit limitation to 2.75 percent or more of the average final compensation of a police officer for all years of credited service, the plan may not thereafter decrease the percentage amount or the maximum benefit limitation to less than 2.75 percent of the average final compensation of a police officer for all years of credited service. (3) The monthly retirement income payable in the event of normal retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the police officer’s normal retirement date, or on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the police officer’s actual retirement, if later, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the police officer’s death; except that, in the event the police officer dies after retirement but before receiving retirement benefits for a period of 10 years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as designated by the police officer for the balance of such 10-year period, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the estate of the police officer, as provided in s. 185.162. If a police officer continues in the service of the city beyond his or her normal retirement date and dies prior to the date of actual retirement, without an option made pursuant to s. 185.161 being in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made for a period of 10 years to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the police officer as if the police officer had retired on the date on which death occurred, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the estate of the police officer, as provided in s. 185.162. (4) Early retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the city, with the consent of the city, as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the police officer’s normal retirement date but subsequent to the date as of which the police officer has both attained the age of 50 years and completed 10 years of contributing service. In the event of early retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: (a) The early retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or immediately following the date a police officer retires from the service of the city under the provisions of this section prior to his or her normal retirement date. (b) The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a police officer who retires prior to his or her normal retirement date under the provisions of this section shall be an amount computed as described in subsection (2), taking into account his or her credited service to the date of actual retirement and his or her final monthly compensation as of such date, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the police officer’s younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments. In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed 3 percent for each year by which the member’s age at retirement preceded the member’s normal retirement age, as provided in subsection (1). (c) The retirement income payable in the event of early retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the police officer’s early retirement date and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired police officer’s death; except that, in the event the police officer dies before receiving retirement benefits for a period of 10 years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the police officer for the balance of such 10-year period, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the same monthly benefit for the balance of such 10-year period shall be payable as provided in s. 185.162.

A retirement income of larger monthly amount, payable to the police officer for his or her lifetime only. 2. A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the police officer during the joint lifetime of the police officer and a joint annuitant designated by the police officer, and following the death of either of them, 100 percent, 75 percent, 662/3 percent, or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. 3. Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefit as, in the opinion of the board of trustees, will best meet the circumstances of the retiring police officer. (b) The police officer upon electing any option of this section must designate the joint annuitant or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of the police officer’s death, and may change such designation but any such change shall be deemed a new election and is subject to approval by the pension committee. Such designation must name a joint annuitant or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a police officer has elected an option with a joint annuitant or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits have commenced, he or she may change the designated joint annuitant or beneficiary but only if the board of trustees consents to such change and if the joint annuitant last designated by the police officer is alive when he or she files with the board of trustees a request for such change. The consent of a police officer’s joint annuitant or beneficiary to any such change is not required. The board of trustees may request evidence of the good health of the joint annuitant being removed, and the amount of the retirement income payable to the police officer upon the designation of a new joint annuitant shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the ages and gender of the former joint annuitant, the new joint annuitant, and the police officer. Each designation must be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees and filed with the board of trustees. If no designated beneficiary survives the police officer, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the police officer subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in s. 185.162. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a retired police officer may change his or her designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two times as provided in s. 185.341 without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. (2) Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: (a) If a police officer dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under s. 185.21. (b) If the designated beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the police officer’s retirement under the plan, the option elected is canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount is payable to the police officer upon his or her retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the police officer before his or her retirement and within 90 days after the death of the beneficiary. (c) If both the retired police officer and the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (1)(a)3., the board of trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with s. 185.162. (d) If a police officer continues beyond his or her normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of s. 185.16(1) and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the police officer in the amount or amounts computed as if the police officer had retired under the option on the date on which death occurred. (3) No police officer may make any change in his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check.

      "text": "185.18 Disability retirement.—For any municipality, chapter plan, local law municipality, or local law plan under this chapter: (1) A police officer having 10 or more years of credited service, or a police officer who becomes totally and permanently disabled in the line of duty, regardless of length of service, may retire from the service of the city under the plan if he or she becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined in subsection (2) by reason of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (3) on or after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall herein be referred to as disability retirement. (2) A police officer will be considered totally disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, he or she is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a police officer; and a police officer will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, such police officer is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than as specified in subsection (3). (3) A police officer will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a result of: (a) Excessive and habitual use by the police officer of drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics; (b) Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; (c) Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while serving in any armed forces; (d) Injury or disease sustained by the police officer after employment has terminated; (e) Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. (4) No police officer shall be permitted to retire under the provisions of this section until examined by a duly qualified physician or surgeon, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and is found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified in this section. Any police officer retiring under this section may be examined periodically by a duly qualified physician or surgeon or board of physicians and surgeons to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. (5) The benefit payable to a police officer who retires from the service of the city with a total and permanent disability as a result of a disability is the monthly income payable for 10 years certain and life for which, if the police officer’s disability occurred in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall be the accrued retirement benefit, but shall not be less than 42 percent of his or her average monthly compensation as of the police officer’s disability retirement date. If after 10 years of service the disability is other than in the line of duty, the police officer’s monthly benefit shall be the accrued normal retirement benefit, but shall not be less than 25 percent of his or her average monthly compensation as of the police officer’s disability retirement date. (6) The monthly retirement income to which a police officer is entitled in the event of his or her disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be, if the police officer recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery or, if the police officer dies without recovering from his or her disability, the payment due next preceding death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. In lieu of the benefit payment as provided in this subsection, a police officer may select an optional form as provided in s. 185.161. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled police officer shall be paid to the police officer’s designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as provided in ss. 185.162 and 185.21. (7) If the board of trustees finds that a police officer who is receiving a disability retirement income is no longer disabled, as provided herein, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. Recovery from disability as used herein shall mean the ability of the police officer to render useful and efficient service as a police officer.

The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: (1) The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits, after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality if additional assets are required, in which event the municipality shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. (2) The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan, as specified in subsection (3). (3) The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the employee’s accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the employee. (4) If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the municipality, less return to the state of the state’s contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality and the state. (5) The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with the manner of distribution determined under subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the municipality or the board of trustees of the municipal police officers’ retirement trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

      "text": "185.50 Retiree health insurance subsidy.—For any municipality, chapter plan, local law municipality, or local law plan under this chapter, under the broad grant of home rule powers under the State Constitution and chapter 166, municipalities have the authority to establish and administer locally funded health insurance subsidy programs. Pursuant thereto: (1) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to allow municipalities the option to use premium tax moneys, as provided for under this chapter, to establish and administer health insurance subsidy programs which will provide a monthly subsidy payment to retired members of any municipal police officers’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter, or to beneficiaries who are spouses or financial dependents entitled to receive benefits under such a plan, in order to assist such retired members or beneficiaries in paying the costs of health insurance. (2) MUNICIPAL RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY TRUST FUNDS; ESTABLISHMENT AND TERMINATION.— (a) Any municipality having a municipal police officers’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter may, in its discretion, establish by ordinance a trust fund to be known as the Municipal Police Officers’ Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund. This fund may be a separate account established for such purpose in the existing municipal police officers’ pension fund, provided that all funds deposited in such account are segregated from, and not commingled with, pension funds or other public moneys and that the account otherwise conforms to the requirements of subsection (8). The trust fund shall be used to account for all moneys received and disbursed pursuant to this section. (b) Prior to the second reading of the ordinance before the municipal legislative body, an actuarial valuation must be performed by an enrolled actuary as defined in s. 185.02, and copies of the valuation and the proposed implementing ordinance shall be furnished to the division. (c) The subsidy program may, at the discretion of the municipal governing body, be permanently discontinued by municipal ordinance at any time, subject to the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions established for plan termination and fund distribution under s. 185.37. (3) FUNDING.—Trust funds established pursuant to this section shall be funded in the following manner: (a) By payment to the fund of an amount equivalent to one-half of the net increase over the previous tax year in the premium tax funds provided for in this chapter, said amount to be established in the implementing ordinance. (b) By no less than one-half of 1 percent of the base salary of each police officer, for so long as the police officer is employed and covered by a pension plan established pursuant to this chapter. The municipality, with approval of the board of trustees, may increase member contributions if needed to fund benefits greater than the minimums established in this section. (c) By payment by the municipality, on at least a quarterly basis, of whatever sum is determined necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of the fund in accordance with s. 112.64. Such contributions and payments shall be submitted to the board of trustees of the police officers’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 185.35, and deposited in the Municipal Police Officers’ Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund, in the same manner and subject to the same time constraints as provided under s. 185.11. (4) ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY.—A person who has contributed to the Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund and retires under a municipal police officers’ pension trust fund system or plan as provided under this chapter, including any local law plan as provided under s. 185.35, or a beneficiary who is a spouse or financial dependent entitled to receive benefits under such a plan, is eligible for health insurance subsidy payments provided under this section. However, the fund, with approval of the board of trustees and the municipality, may provide coverage to retirees and beneficiaries when the retirees have not contributed to the fund as provided in subsection (3). Payment of the retiree health insurance subsidy shall be made only after coverage for health insurance for the retiree or beneficiary has been certified in writing to the board of trustees of the municipal police officers’ pension trust fund. (5) RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY AMOUNT.—Beginning on the effective date established in the implementing ordinance, each eligible retiree, or beneficiary who is a spouse or financial dependent thereof, shall receive a monthly retiree health insurance subsidy payment equal to the aggregate number of years of service with the municipality, as defined in s. 185.02, completed at the time of retirement multiplied by an amount determined in the implementing ordinance, but no less than $3 for each year of service. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the plan sponsor from establishing, in the implementing ordinance, a cap of no less than 30 years upon the number of years’ service for which credit will be given toward a health insurance subsidy or a maximum monthly subsidy amount. (6) PAYMENT OF RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDY.—Beginning on the effective date established in the implementing ordinance, any monthly retiree health insurance subsidy amount due and payable under this section shall be paid to retired members, or their eligible beneficiaries, by the board of trustees of the police officers’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 185.35, in the same manner as provided by s. 185.06(1)(c) for drafts upon the pension fund. (7) INVESTMENT OF THE TRUST FUND.—The trustees of the police officers’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 185.35, are hereby authorized to invest and reinvest the funds of the Municipal Police Officers’ Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as apply hereunder to the investment of municipal police officers’ pension funds under s. 185.06. (8) DEPOSIT OF PENSION FUNDS.—All funds of the health insurance subsidy fund may be deposited by the board of trustees with the treasurer of the municipality, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he or she is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the municipality. Any funds so deposited shall be segregated by said treasurer in a separate fund, clearly identified as funds of the health insurance subsidy fund. In lieu thereof, the board of trustees shall deposit the funds of the health insurance subsidy fund in a qualified public depository as defined in s. 280.02, which shall conform to and be bound by the provisions of chapter 280 with regard to such funds. In no case shall the funds of the health insurance subsidy fund be deposited in any financial institution, brokerage house trust company, or other entity that is not a public depository as provided by s. 280.02. (9) SEPARATION FROM SERVICE; REFUNDS.—Any police officer who terminates employment with a municipality having a Municipal Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund system or plan as provided under this section shall be entitled to a refund of all employee contributions he or she made to that trust fund, without interest, regardless of whether he or she has vested for purposes of retirement. Any police officer who has vested for purposes of retirement in the service of the municipality, and has contributed to the Municipal Police Officers’ Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund for so long as he or she was eligible to make such contributions, may, in his or her discretion, elect to leave his or her accrued contributions in the fund, whereupon, such police officer shall, upon retiring and commencing to draw retirement benefits, receive a health insurance subsidy based upon his or her aggregate number of years of service with the municipality, as defined in s. 185.02. (10) ADMINISTRATION OF SYSTEM; ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS; AUDITS; RULES; ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.—The board of trustees of the police officers’ pension trust fund, or the plan trustees in the case of local law plans established under s. 185.35, shall be solely responsible for administering the health insurance subsidy trust fund. Pursuant thereto: (a) As part of its administrative duties, no less frequently than every 3 years, the board shall have an actuarial valuation of the Municipal Police Officers’ Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Trust Fund prepared as provided in s. 112.63 by an enrolled actuary, covering the same reporting period or plan year used for the municipal police officers’ pension plan, and shall submit a report of the valuation, including actuarial assumptions and type and basis of funding, to the division. (b) By February 1 of each year, the trustees shall file a report with the division, containing an independent audit by a certified public accountant if the fund has $250,000 or more in assets, or a certified statement of accounting if the fund has less than $250,000 in assets, for the most recent plan year, showing a detailed listing of assets and methods used to value them and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements shall be reconciled with the assets at the beginning of and end of the year. (c) The trustees may adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this section. (d) At the discretion of the plan sponsor, the cost of administration may be appropriated from the trust fund or paid directly by the plan sponsor. (11) BENEFITS.—Subsidy payments shall be payable under the municipal police officers’ retiree health insurance subsidy program only to participants in the program or their beneficiaries. Such subsidy payments shall not be subject to assignment, execution, or attachment or to any legal process whatsoever, and shall be in addition to any other benefits to which eligible recipients are entitled under any workers’ compensation law, pension law, collective bargaining agreement, municipal or county ordinance, or any other state or federal statute. (12) DISTRIBUTION OF PREMIUM TAXES; COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.—Premium tax dollars for which spending authority is granted under this section shall be distributed from the Police and Firefighters’ Premium Tax Trust Fund and remitted annually to municipalities in the same manner as provided under this chapter for police officers’ pension funds. Once a health insurance subsidy plan has been implemented by a municipality under this section, in order for the municipality to participate in the distribution of premium tax dollars authorized under this section, all provisions of this section, including state acceptance pursuant to part VII of chapter 112, shall be complied with, and said premium tax dollars may be withheld for noncompliance.
