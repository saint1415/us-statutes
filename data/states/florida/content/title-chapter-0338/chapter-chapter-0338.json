All tolls so collected shall first be used to pay the annual cost of the operation, maintenance, and improvement of the toll project. (2) If the revenue-producing project is on the State Highway System, any remaining toll revenue shall be used for the construction, maintenance, or improvement of any road on the State Highway System within the county or counties in which the revenue-producing project is located. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department, including the turnpike enterprise, shall index toll rates on existing toll facilities to the annual Consumer Price Index or similar inflation indicators. Toll rate adjustments for inflation under this subsection may be made no more frequently than once a year and must be made no less frequently than once every 5 years as necessary to accommodate cash toll rate schedules. Toll rates may be increased beyond these limits as directed by bond documents, covenants, or governing body authorization or pursuant to department administrative rule. (4) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, pursuant to s. 11, Art. VII of the State Constitution, and subject to the requirements of subsection (2), the Department of Transportation may request the Division of Bond Finance to issue bonds secured by toll revenues collected on the Alligator Alley and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to fund transportation projects located within the county or counties in which the project is located and contained in the adopted work program of the department. (5) If the revenue-producing project is on the county road system, any remaining toll revenue shall be used for the construction, maintenance, or improvement of any other state or county road within the county or counties in which the revenue-producing project is located. (6) Selection of projects on the State Highway System for construction, maintenance, or improvement with toll revenues shall be, with the concurrence of the department, consistent with the Florida Transportation Plan. (7) This section does not apply to high-occupancy toll lanes or express lanes. (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), and not including high occupancy toll lanes or express lanes, no tolls may be charged for use of an interstate highway where tolls were not charged as of July 1, 1997. (9) With the exception of subsection (3), this section does not apply to the turnpike system as defined under the Florida Turnpike Enterprise Law. (10) The department’s Beachline-East Expressway may be transferred by the department and become part of the turnpike system under the Florida Turnpike Enterprise Law. Any funds expended by the Florida Turnpike Enterprise for the acquisition of the Beachline-East Expressway shall be deposited into the State Transportation Trust Fund, and, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, such funds shall first be allocated by the department to fund the department’s obligation to construct the Wekiva Parkway. The term “Wekiva Parkway” means a limited access highway or expressway constructed between State Road 429 and Interstate 4 specifically incorporating the corridor alignment recommended by Recommendation 2 of the Wekiva River Basin Area Task Force final report dated January 15, 2003, and the recommendations of the SR 429 Working Group which were adopted January 16, 2004, and related transportation facilities. (11) The department’s Pinellas Bayway System may be transferred by the department and become part of the turnpike system under the Florida Turnpike Enterprise Law. The transfer does not affect the rights of the parties, or their successors in interest, under the settlement agreement and final judgment in Leonard Lee Ratner, Esther Ratner, and Leeco Gas and Oil Co. v. State Road Department of the State of Florida, No. 67-1081 (Fla. 2nd Cir. Ct. 1968). Upon transfer of the Pinellas Bayway System to the turnpike system, the department shall also transfer to the Florida Turnpike Enterprise the funds deposited in the reserve account established by chapter 85-364, Laws of Florida, as amended by chapters 95-382 and 2014-223, Laws of Florida, which funds shall be used by the Florida Turnpike Enterprise solely to help fund the costs of repair or replacement of the transferred facilities.

(4) The department may implement variable rate tolls on high-occupancy toll lanes or express lanes. The department may require the use of an electronic transponder interoperable with the department’s electronic toll collection system for the use of high-occupancy toll lanes or express lanes. (5) Effective July 1, 2018, if a customer’s average travel speed for a trip in an express lane falls below 40 miles per hour, the customer must be charged the minimum express lane toll.

Powers shall include, but are not limited to, the ability to plan, construct, maintain, repair, and operate the Florida Turnpike System. (b) It is the express intention of the Florida Turnpike Law that the Florida Turnpike Enterprise be authorized to plan, develop, own, purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire, demolish, construct, improve, relocate, equip, repair, maintain, operate, and manage the Florida Turnpike System; to expend funds to publicize, advertise, and promote the advantages of using the turnpike system and its facilities; and to cooperate, coordinate, partner, and contract with other entities, public and private, to accomplish these purposes. (c) The executive director of the turnpike enterprise shall appoint a staff, which shall be exempt from part II of chapter 110. Among the staff shall be a chief financial officer, who must be a proven, effective administrator with demonstrated experience in financial management of a large bonded capital program and must hold an active license to practice public accounting in Florida pursuant to chapter 473. The turnpike enterprise staff shall also include the Office of Toll Operations. (d) The Florida Turnpike Enterprise shall pursue and implement new technologies and processes in its operations and collection of tolls and the collection of other amounts associated with road and infrastructure usage. Such technologies and processes must include, without limitation, video billing and variable pricing. The Florida Turnpike Enterprise may require the use of an electronic transponder interoperable with the department’s electronic toll collection system for the use of express lanes on the turnpike system. Variable pricing may not be implemented in express lanes when the level of service in the express lane, determined in accordance with the criteria established by the Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual (5th Edition, HCM 2010), as amended from time to time, is equal to level of service A. Variable pricing in express lanes when the level of service in the express lane is level of service B may only be implemented by charging the general toll lane toll amount plus an amount set by department rule. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, pricing in express lanes when the level of service is other than level of service A or level of service B may vary in the manner established by the Florida Turnpike Enterprise to manage congestion in the express lanes. (e) Effective July 1, 2018, if a customer’s average travel speed for a trip in an express lane falls below 40 miles per hour, the customer must be charged the general toll lane toll amount plus an amount set by department rule. A customer’s express lane average travel speed is his or her average travel speed from the customer’s entry point to the customer’s exit point. (f) The Florida Turnpike Enterprise may enter into one or more agreements to fund, construct, and operate facilities for the advancement of autonomous and connected innovative transportation technologies for the purposes of improving safety and decreasing congestion for the traveling public. Such agreements may include terms that authorize a private entity to sell or provide products or business opportunities at the facilities which benefit the traveling public, provide additional revenue, or otherwise advance the enterprise’s objectives as set forth in the Florida Transportation Code. (2) The department shall have the authority to employ procurement methods available to the Department of Management Services under chapters 255 and 287 and under any rule adopted under such chapters solely for the benefit of the turnpike enterprise. (3)(a) The turnpike enterprise shall be a single budget entity and shall develop a budget pursuant to chapter 216. The turnpike enterprise’s budget shall be submitted to the Legislature along with the department’s budget. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 216.301 to the contrary and in accordance with s. 216.351, the Executive Office of the Governor shall, on July 1 of each year, certify forward all unexpended funds appropriated or provided pursuant to this section for the turnpike enterprise. Of the unexpended funds certified forward, any unencumbered amounts shall be carried forward. Such funds carried forward shall not exceed 5 percent of the original approved operating budget as defined in s. 216.181(1) of the turnpike enterprise. Funds carried forward pursuant to this section may be used for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, promotional and market activities, technology, and training. Any certified forward funds remaining undisbursed on September 30 of each year shall be carried forward. (4) The powers conferred upon the turnpike enterprise under ss. 338.22-338.241 shall be in addition and supplemental to the existing powers of the department and the turnpike enterprise, and these powers shall not be construed as repealing any provision of any other law, general or local, but shall supersede such other laws that are inconsistent with the exercise of the powers provided under ss. 338.22-338.241 and provide a complete method for the exercise of such powers granted.

(c) Prior to requesting legislative approval of a proposed turnpike project, the environmental feasibility of the proposed project shall be reviewed by the Department of Environmental Protection. The department shall submit its Project Development and Environmental Report to the Department of Environmental Protection, along with a draft copy of a public notice. Within 14 days of receipt of the draft public notice, the Department of Environmental Protection shall return the draft public notice to the Department of Transportation with an approval of the language or modifications to the language. Upon receipt of the approved or modified draft, or if no comments are provided within 14 days, the Department of Transportation shall publish the notice as provided in chapter 50 to provide a 30-day public comment period. If published in the print edition of a newspaper, the headline of the required notice shall be in a type no smaller than 18 point, shall be placed in that portion of the newspaper where legal notices appear, and shall be published in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices in the county or counties of general interest and readership in the community as provided in s. 50.031. Whenever possible, the notice shall appear in a newspaper that is published at least weekly. All notices published pursuant to this section shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 1. The purpose of the notice is to provide for a 30-day period for written public comments on the environmental impacts of a proposed turnpike project. 2. The name and description of the project, along with a geographic location map clearly indicating the area where the proposed project will be located. 3. The address where such comments must be sent and the date such comments are due. After a review of the department’s report and any public comments, the Department of Environmental Protection shall submit a statement of environmental feasibility to the department within 30 days after the date on which public comments are due. The notice and the statement of environmental feasibility shall not give rise to any rights to a hearing or other rights or remedies provided pursuant to chapter 120 or chapter 403, and shall not bind the Department of Environmental Protection in any subsequent environmental permit review. (2)(a) Subject to the provisions of s. 338.228, the department is authorized to expend, out of any funds available for the purpose, such moneys as may be necessary for studies, preliminary engineering, construction, right-of-way acquisition, and construction engineering inspection of any turnpike project and is authorized to use its engineering and other resources for such purposes. (b) In accordance with the legislative intent expressed in s. 337.273, and after the requirements of paragraph (1)(c) have been met, the department may acquire lands and property before making a final determination of the economic feasibility of a project. The requirements of paragraph (1)(c) do not apply to hardship and protective purchases of advance right-of-way by the department. The cost of advance acquisition of right-of-way may be paid from bonds issued under s. 337.276 or from turnpike revenues. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “hardship purchase” means purchase from a property owner of a residential dwelling of not more than four units who is at a disadvantage due to health impairment, job loss, or significant loss of rental income. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “protective purchase” means that a purchase to limit development, building, or other intensification of land uses within the area right-of-way is needed for transportation facilities. The department shall give written notice to the Department of Environmental Protection 30 days before final agency acceptance as set forth in s. 119.0711, which notice shall allow the Department of Environmental Protection to comment. Hardship and protective purchases of right-of-way shall not influence the environmental feasibility of a project, including the decision relative to the need to construct the project or the selection of a specific location. Costs to acquire and dispose of property acquired as hardship and protective purchases are considered costs of doing business for the department and are not to be considered in the determination of environmental feasibility for the project. (3) All obligations and expenses incurred by the department under this section shall be paid by the department and charged to the appropriate turnpike project. The department shall keep proper records and accounts showing each amount that is so charged. All obligations and expenses so incurred shall be treated as part of the cost of such project and shall be reimbursed to the department out of turnpike revenues or out of the bonds authorized under ss. 338.22-338.241 except when such reimbursement is prohibited by state or federal law. (4) The department is authorized, with the approval of the Legislature, to use federal and state transportation funds to lend or pay a portion of the operating, maintenance, and capital costs of turnpike projects. For operating and maintenance loans, the maximum net loan amount in any fiscal year shall not exceed 1.5 percent of state transportation tax revenues for that fiscal year.

(1) In selecting a proposed site for a designated staging area under this section, the department, in consultation with the Division of Emergency Management, must consider the extent to which such site: (a) Is located in a geographic area that best facilitates the wide dissemination of emergency-related supplies and equipment; (b) Provides ease of access to major highways and other transportation facilities; (c) Is sufficiently large to accommodate the staging of a significant amount of emergency-related supplies and equipment; (d) Provides space in support of emergency preparedness and evacuation activities, such as fuel reserve capacity; (e) Could be used during nonemergency periods for commercial motor vehicle parking and for other uses; and (f) Is consistent with other state and local emergency management considerations. (2) The department may acquire property and property rights necessary for such staging areas as provided in s. 338.04. (3) The department may authorize other uses of a staging area as provided in the Florida Transportation Code, including, but not limited to, for commercial motor vehicle parking to comply with federal hours-of-service off-duty requirements or sleeper berth requirements and for other vehicular parking to provide rest for drivers.

      "text": "338.26 Alligator Alley toll road.— (1) The Legislature finds that the construction of Alligator Alley, designated as State Highway 84 and federal Interstate Highway 75, has provided a convenient and necessary connection of the east and west coasts of Florida for commerce and other purposes. However, this state highway has contributed to the alteration of water flows in the Everglades and affected ecological patterns of the historical southern Everglades. The Legislature has determined that it is appropriate and in the public interest to establish a system of tolls for use of Alligator Alley to produce needed financial resources to help restore the natural resource values lost by construction of this highway. (2) The Department of Transportation is directed to continue the system of tolls on this highway. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 338.165(2) to the contrary, such toll collections shall be used for the purposes of this section. (3)(a) Fees generated from tolls shall be deposited in the State Transportation Trust Fund and shall be used: 1. To reimburse outstanding contractual obligations; 2. To operate and maintain the highway and toll facilities, including reconstruction and restoration; 3. To pay for those projects that are funded with Alligator Alley toll revenues and that are contained in the 1993-1994 adopted work program or the 1994-1995 tentative work program submitted to the Legislature on February 22, 1994; and 4. By interlocal agreement, to reimburse a local governmental entity for the direct actual costs of operating the fire station at mile marker 63 on Alligator Alley, which shall be used by the local governmental entity to provide fire, rescue, and emergency management services exclusively to the public on Alligator Alley. The local governmental entity must contribute 10 percent of the direct actual operating costs. a. The interlocal agreement effective July 1, 2019, through no later than June 30, 2027, shall control until such time that the local governmental entity and the department enter into a new agreement or agree to extend the existing agreement. For the 2024-2025 fiscal year, the amount of reimbursement may not exceed $2 million. b. By December 31, 2024, and every 5 years thereafter, the local governmental entity shall provide a maintenance and operations comprehensive plan to the department. The comprehensive plan must include a current inventory of assets, including their projected service life, and area service needs; the call and response history for emergency services provided in the preceding 5 years on Alligator Alley, including costs; and future projections for assets and equipment, including replacement or purchase needs, and operating costs. c. The local governmental entity and the department shall review and adopt the comprehensive plan as part of the interlocal agreement. d. In accordance with projected incoming toll revenues for Alligator Alley, the department shall include the corresponding funding needs of the comprehensive plan in the department’s work program, and the local governmental entity shall include the same in its capital comprehensive plan and the appropriate fiscal year budget. e. At the end of the term of the interlocal agreement, the ownership and title of all fire, rescue, and emergency equipment purchased with state funds and used at the fire station during the term of the interlocal agreement transfers to the state. (b) Funds generated annually in excess of those required to pay the expenses in paragraph (a) may be transferred to the Everglades Fund of the South Florida Water Management District. The South Florida Water Management District shall deposit funds for projects undertaken pursuant to s. 373.4592 in the Everglades Trust Fund pursuant to s. 373.45926(4)(a). Any funds remaining in the Everglades Fund may be used for environmental projects to restore the natural values of the Everglades, subject to compliance with any applicable federal laws and regulations. Projects must be limited to: 1. Highway redesign to allow for improved sheet flow of water across the southern Everglades. 2. Water conveyance projects to enable more water resources to reach Florida Bay to replenish marine estuary functions. 3. Engineering design plans for wastewater treatment facilities as recommended in the Water Quality Protection Program Document for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. 4. Acquisition of lands to move STA 3/4 out of the Toe of the Boot, provided such lands are located within 1 mile of the northern border of STA 3/4. 5. Other Everglades Construction Projects as described in the February 15, 1994, conceptual design document. (4) The district may issue revenue bonds or notes under s. 373.584 and pledge the revenue from the transfers from the Alligator Alley toll revenues as security for such bonds or notes. The proceeds from such revenue bonds or notes shall be used for environmental projects; at least 50 percent of said proceeds must be used for projects that benefit Florida Bay, as described in this section subject to resolutions approving such activity by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and the governing board of the South Florida Water Management District and the remaining proceeds must be used for restoration activities in the Everglades Protection Area.
