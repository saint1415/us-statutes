      "text": "238.05 Membership.— (1) The membership of the retirement system shall consist of the following: (a) All persons who were teachers at any time during the school years 1936-1937 through 1938-1939 shall become members as of July 1, 1939, unless, prior to December 1, 1939, any such teacher shall file with the board of trustees on a form prescribed by such board a notice of his or her election not to be covered in the membership of the retirement system and a duly executed waiver of all present and prospective benefits which would otherwise inure to him or her on account of his or her participation in the retirement system; provided, that all persons who were not eligible for membership in the retirement system at the time the system became effective and who are now eligible for membership by reason of the redefinition of the word “teacher,” and by reason of having served in any of the capacities included in the redefinition of the term during any of the school years 1936-1937 through 1942-1943 shall become members as of July 1, 1943, unless prior to December 1, 1943, any such person shall file with the board of trustees a notice of his or her election not to be covered in the membership of the retirement system as prescribed above; provided, that all persons who become eligible for membership in the retirement system by reason of the redefinition in s. 238.01, of the word “teacher,” and who served in any of the capacities included in the redefinition of the term during any of the school years 1936-1937 through 1944-1945, shall become members as of July 1, 1945, unless prior to December 1, 1945, any such person shall file with the board of trustees a notice of his or her election not to be covered in the membership of the retirement system as prescribed above; provided also that all persons who become eligible for membership in the retirement system by reason of the redefinition in s. 238.01(4), Florida Statutes 1949, of the word “teacher” and who served in any of the capacities included in the redefinition of the term during any of the school years 1936-1937 through 1946-1947 shall become members as of July 1, 1947, unless prior to December 1, 1947, any such person shall file with the board of trustees a notice of his or her election not to be kept in the membership of the retirement system as prescribed above; provided, however, that any person who has heretofore filed a nonelection waiver blank shall not be required to make another such election; provided, further, that any person who heretofore has elected not to become a member shall until July 1, 1949, have the option of becoming a member. (b) All persons who became or who become teachers on or after July 1, 1939, except as provided in paragraph (a) and subsection (5) hereof, shall become members of the retirement system by virtue of their appointment as teachers. However, employees who are not members of the teaching or professional staff shall only become members of the retirement system by filing a notice with the department of their election to become members. (2) A teacher whose membership in the retirement system is contingent on his or her own election and who has elected not to become a member, may thereafter apply for and be admitted to membership and receive credit for prior service; provided no such teacher shall receive credit for service prior to such election unless he or she is admitted to membership as of a date before May 1, 1959. Credit for service rendered prior to July 1, 1939, shall be for continuous employment only except that one period of absence of not more than 5 years will be allowed in computing such prior service credit, provided, however, that a teacher admitted to membership prior to January 1, 1955, shall receive credit for all prior service and if he or she has retired, his or her retirement allowance shall be increased effective July 1, 1961. A teacher admitted to membership under this provision must pay into the Annuity Savings Trust Fund prior to his or her retirement contributions plus regular interest thereon based upon all salary received as a teacher prior to and after July 1, 1939. (3) Except as otherwise provided in s. 238.07(9), membership of any person in the retirement system will cease if he or she is continuously unemployed as a teacher for a period of more than 5 consecutive years, or upon the withdrawal by the member of his or her accumulated contributions as provided in s. 238.07(13), or upon retirement, or upon death; provided that the adjustments prescribed below are to be made for persons who enter the Armed Forces of the United States during a period of war or national emergency and for persons who are granted leaves of absence. Any member of the retirement system who within 1 year before the time of entering the Armed Forces of the United States was a teacher, as defined in s. 238.01, or was engaged in other public educational work within the state, and member of the Teachers’ Retirement System at the time of induction, or who has been or is granted leave of absence, shall be permitted to elect to continue his or her membership in the Teachers’ Retirement System; and membership service shall be allowed for the period covered by service in the Armed Forces of the United States or by leave of absence under the following conditions: (a) A person who has been granted leave of absence shall file with the department before his or her next contribution is due an application to continue his or her membership during the period covered by the person’s leave of absence and, if such application is filed, shall make his or her contribution to the retirement system on the basis of his or her last previous annual salary as a teacher, and shall, prior to retirement, pay in full to the system such contributions with accumulated regular interest. Such contributions with interest may be paid at one time or in monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payments in the person’s discretion. (b) A person who enters or who has entered the Armed Forces of the United States may either continue his or her membership according to the plan outlined under paragraph (a) or, in lieu thereof, may file with the department at any time following the close of his or her military service an application that his or her membership be continued and that membership service be allowed for not more than 5 years of his or her period of service in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or national emergency; provided that any such person shall, prior to retirement, pay in full his or her contributions with accumulated regular interest to the retirement system for the period for which he or she is entitled to membership service on the basis of his or her last previous annual salary as a teacher. Such contributions with interest may be paid to the department at one time or in monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payments in the person’s discretion. (4) The department may in its discretion deny the right to become members to any class of teachers who are serving on a temporary or any other than a per annum basis, and it may also in its discretion make optional with members in any such class their individual entrance into membership. (5) Any person may, at his or her option, choose not to become a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System when: (a) An election is made to the division not to become a member within 60 days of appointment to a teaching position as defined in this chapter or within 60 days from the date this law becomes effective. (b) Any election hereunder will not affect any rights accrued in the retirement system to which the person belongs.

(2) The provisions for the retirement of a member are as follows: (a) To retire at the age of 60 upon the basis of a standard of service of 35 years (this provision shall be known and referred to throughout this chapter as plan A); or (b) To retire at the age of 55 upon the basis of a standard of service of 35 years (this provision shall be known and referred to throughout this chapter as plan B); or (c) To retire at the age of 55 upon the basis of a standard of service of 30 years (this provision shall be known and referred to throughout this chapter as plan C); or (d) To retire after 25 years of service upon the basis of a standard of service of 25 years provided the member has reached age 50; provided, further, however, that a member electing to retire under this provision shall not be eligible to receive the benefits allowed by subsection (8) and paragraph (11)(f) (this provision shall be known and referred to throughout this chapter as plan D); or (e) To retire: 1. At normal retirement age which shall be age 60 for those persons whose membership date, or last renewal thereof, occurred prior to July 1, 1963, and age 62 for those persons whose membership date, or last renewal thereof, occurred on or after July 1, 1963; or 2. Prior to normal retirement age but at or subsequent to age 55, provided that upon such date the member has completed 10 years of creditable service, which shall be the early retirement age; or 3. Subsequent to normal retirement age, which shall be the delayed retirement age; (this provision shall be known and referred to throughout this chapter as plan E); or (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, effective January 1, 1993, the normal retirement age for a member under this chapter is attained upon the member’s completion of 30 years of creditable service in the aggregate. The manner and time of selecting a plan of retirement are set out elsewhere in this chapter. (3) Any member who, prior to July 1, 1955, elected to retire under one of plans A, B, C, or D may elect, prior to retirement, to retire under plan E in accordance with the terms hereof. Any person who became a member on or after July 1, 1955, shall retire under plan E, except as provided for under s. 238.31. With respect to plans A, B, C, or D, any member shall have the right at any time to change to a plan of retirement requiring a lower rate of contribution. The Department of Management Services shall also notify the member of the rate of contribution such member must make from and after selecting such plan of retirement. Any member in service may retire upon reaching the age of retirement formerly selected by him or her, upon the member’s written application to the department setting forth at which time, not more than 90 days subsequent to the execution and filing of such application, it is his or her desire to retire notwithstanding that during such period of notification he or she may have separated from service. Upon receipt of such application for retirement, the department shall retire such member not more than 90 days thereafter. Before such member may retire he or she must file with the department his or her written selection of one of the optional benefits provided in s. 238.08. (4) Upon service retirement under plans A and B, a member shall receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a) An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member’s accumulated contributions at the time of his or her retirement; and (b) A pension, in addition to this annuity, of one one-hundred-fortieth of the member’s average final compensation, multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership service since he or she last became a member; and (c) If the member has a prior service certificate in full force and effect, an additional pension of one-seventieth of his or her average final compensation, multiplied by the number of years of service certified on his or her prior service certificate. (5) Upon service retirement under plan C a member shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a) An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member’s accumulated contributions at the time of his or her retirement; and (b) A pension, in addition to the member’s annuity of one one-hundred-twentieth of his or her average final compensation, multiplied by the number of years of membership service since he or she last became a member; and (c) If the member has a prior service certificate in full force and effect, an additional pension of one-sixtieth of his or her average final compensation, multiplied by the number of years of service certified on his or her prior service certificate. (6) Upon service retirement under plan D, a member shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a) An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member’s accumulated contributions at the time of his or her retirement; and (b) A pension, in addition to the member’s annuity, of one one-hundredth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership service since he or she last became a member; and (c) If the member has a prior service certificate in full force and effect, an additional pension of one-fiftieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service certified on his or her prior service certificate. (7) Upon service retirement under plan E, a member shall receive a service retirement allowance which shall be determined as follows: (a) At normal retirement age: Two percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. (b) At early retirement age: Two percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of creditable service and adjusted for actuarial equivalents based on completed months by which early retirement precedes normal retirement as provided in paragraph (2)(e). (c) At delayed retirement age: Two percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. (8) Any member who has heretofore, or who hereafter, retires after 30 years of creditable service shall receive a retirement allowance of not less than $100 per month, provided, however that with respect to plans A, B, or C, any person with less than 30 but with 10 or more years of service shall be entitled to a service retirement allowance which shall be computed on the basis of an average final compensation of $2,400 per year and shall receive a retirement allowance which shall be the equivalent of one-sixtieth of said average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of his or her creditable service; provided that in no event shall such a member receive a retirement allowance greater than $100 per month. (9) Any member who has taught, or who teaches in the public free schools of Florida for not less than an aggregate of 10 years and withdraws or has withdrawn from the system, may elect to leave his or her accumulated contributions in the system or to repay his or her withdrawn accumulations to the system, and upon reaching retirement age, the member shall receive a retirement allowance based on the number of years of service which he or she taught in the public schools of Florida before retirement, provided, that a person who has lost his or her membership and later returns to service shall be allowed the privilege of having credit restored for previous service if he or she returns to full-time teaching service and renders 3 additional years of continuous service. (10) Any member in service, who has 10 or more years of creditable service, may upon the application of his or her employer or upon his or her own application, be retired by the department not less than 30 nor more than 90 days next following the date of filing such application, on a disability retirement allowance; provided that a physician licensed by this state examines and certifies that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that such member should be retired, and the department concurs. In making the determination, the department may require other evidence of disability as deemed appropriate. (11) Upon retirement on account of disability, a member shall be paid his or her service retirement allowance if he or she is eligible for a service retirement allowance; otherwise, the member shall receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a) An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his or her accumulated contributions at the time of retirement; and (b) If the member is making contributions for retirement under plan A or B, he or she shall receive a pension which, together with his or her annuity shall provide a total retirement allowance equal to one-seventieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service creditable to him or her at retirement, if such retirement allowance exceeds 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation; or if such retirement allowance does not exceed 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation, a pension shall be payable which, together with his or her annuity, shall provide a total retirement allowance of 25 percent of his or her average final compensation; provided, however that no retirement allowance shall exceed one-seventieth of his or her average final compensation, multiplied by the number of years of total service which would be credited to the member were his or her service continued to the minimum age for service retirement. (c) If the member is making contributions for retirement under plan C, he or she shall receive a pension which, together with his or her annuity, shall provide a total retirement allowance equal to one-sixtieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service creditable to him or her at retirement, if such retirement allowance exceeds 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation; or if such retirement allowance does not exceed 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation, a pension shall be payable which, together with his or her annuity, shall provide a total retirement allowance of 25 percent of his or her average final compensation; provided, however that no retirement allowance shall exceed one-sixtieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of total service which would be credited to the member were his or her service continued to the minimum age for service retirement. (d) If the member is making contributions for retirement under plan D, he or she shall receive a pension, which together with his or her annuity shall provide a total retirement allowance equal to one-fiftieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service creditable to him or her at retirement, if such retirement allowance exceeds 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation; or if such retirement allowance does not exceed 25 percent of the member’s average final compensation, a pension shall be payable which, together with his or her annuity, shall provide a total retirement allowance of 25 percent of his or her average final compensation, provided, however that no retirement allowance shall exceed one-fiftieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of total service which would be creditable to the member were his or her service continued to the minimum age of service retirement; provided, however that when a member has taught the standard number of years required for retirement under any of the several retirement plans provided by this section and elected by such member, and such member shall retire on account of disability prior to attainment of the minimum required age under the plan elected, then such member so retired shall receive the same benefits as if he or she had retired on service retirement under the plan elected. (e) If the member is making contributions for retirement under plan E, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of 100 percent of the retirement allowance to which he or she would be entitled if his or her date of disability retirement were his or her otherwise normal retirement date; provided, however that the retirement allowance payable upon disability retirement shall not be less than the 25 percent of average final compensation nor, if disability retirement occurs prior to the date on which the member is first eligible for service retirement, shall it be greater than the service retirement allowance to which the member would be entitled if he or she continued in active service to such date at the same rate of compensation effective on the date of disability retirement. (f) With respect to plans A, B, or C, the average final compensation under this subsection shall be computed on the actual average final compensation, or upon the basis of an average final compensation of $2,400 per year, whichever is the greater. (g) Notwithstanding the minimum disability retirement allowance set out in paragraphs (a) through (f), any member who retired prior to July 1, 1957, on account of disability, shall, on and after July 1, 1957, receive as a minimum disability retirement allowance $75 per month, or an annual sum equal to 40 multiplied by the number of years of his or her creditable service whichever is the greater, and any person who retires on and after July 1, 1957, shall, from the date of his or her retirement, receive as a minimum disability retirement allowance $75 per month, or an annual sum equal to 40 multiplied by the number of years of creditable service, whichever is the greater. (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a member who has attained normal retirement age and is retiring on account of disability shall be eligible to receive a minimum of 25 percent of his or her average final compensation under Option 1. (12)(a) Once each year during the first 5 years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every 3-year period thereafter, the department may require any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained his or her minimum service retirement age to undergo a medical examination by a physician licensed by this state and to submit any other evidence of disability as required by the department. Should a disability beneficiary who has not yet attained his or her minimum service retirement age refuse to submit to any such medical examination, his or her retirement allowance shall be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for 1 year, all of the disability beneficiary’s rights in and to his or her pension shall be forfeited. (b) If the department finds that a disability beneficiary is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his or her disability retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation, the amount of the beneficiary’s pension shall be reduced to an amount which, together with his or her annuity and the amount earnable by him or her, shall equal the amount of his or her average final compensation. Should the beneficiary’s earning capacity later be changed, the amount of his or her pension may be further modified; provided that the pension so modified shall not exceed the amount of the pension allowable under subsection (11), at the time of retirement, nor an amount which, when added to the amount earnable by the beneficiary, together with his or her annuity, equals the amount of his or her average final compensation. A beneficiary restored to active service at a salary less than the average final compensation upon the basis of which he or she was retired shall not become a member of the retirement system at that time. (c) Should a disability beneficiary under his or her minimum service retirement age be at any time in service at a salary equal to or greater than his or her average final compensation upon the basis of which he or she was retired, the beneficiary’s disability retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall again become a member of the retirement system and shall contribute thereafter at the same rate at which he or she paid prior to disability. Any prior service certificate, on the basis of which his or her allowance was computed at the time of his or her disability retirement, shall be restored to full force and effect; and, in addition, upon his or her subsequent retirement he or she shall be credited with all his or her membership service on the basis of which his or her allowance was computed at the time of his or her disability retirement. (13) Should a member cease to be a teacher except by death or by retirement under the provisions of this chapter, the member shall be paid the amount of his or her accumulated contributions. Should a member die before retirement, the amount of his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid to such person, if any, as he or she shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the department; otherwise, to his or her executors or administrators. (14) Any member who retires on or after July 1, 1954, who at the time of his or her retirement has not served as a teacher in Florida for 10 years shall not be eligible to receive and shall not be paid any service retirement allowance. (15) Any member of the Teachers’ Retirement System who has heretofore, or who hereafter, retires and who has passed his or her 65th birthday and whose retirement allowance is less than $150 shall have his or her retirement allowance redetermined and shall be entitled to a service retirement allowance which shall be computed on the basis of an average final compensation of $2,400 per year and shall receive a retirement allowance which shall be the equivalent of one-sixtieth of said average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of his or her creditable service; provided, that in no event shall such redetermination entitle the member to receive a retirement allowance greater than $150. (16)(a) Any member of the Teachers’ Retirement System who has heretofore, or who hereafter, retires with no less than 10 years of creditable service and who has passed his or her 65th birthday, may, upon application to the department, have his or her retirement allowance redetermined and thereupon shall be entitled to a monthly service retirement allowance which shall be equal to $4 multiplied by the number of years of the member’s creditable service which shall be payable monthly during his or her retirement; provided, that the amount of retirement allowance as determined hereunder, shall be reduced by an amount equal to: 1. Any social security benefits received by the member, and 2. Any social security benefits that the member is eligible to receive by reason of his or her own right or through his or her spouse. (b) No payment shall be made to a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System under this act, until the department has determined the social security status of such member. (c) Eligibility of a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System shall be determined under the social security laws and regulations; provided, however, that a member shall be considered eligible if the member or the member’s spouse has reached 65 years of age and would draw social security if the member or the member’s spouse were not engaged in activity that results in the member or the member’s spouse receiving income that would make him or her ineligible to receive social security benefits. A member of the Teachers’ Retirement System shall be deemed to be eligible for social security benefits if the member has this eligibility in his or her own right or through his or her spouse. (d) The department shall review, at least annually, the social security status of all members of the Teachers’ Retirement System receiving payment under this act and shall increase or decrease payments to such members as shall be necessary to carry out the intent of this act. (e) No member of the Teachers’ Retirement System shall have his or her retirement allowance reduced or any of his or her rights impaired by reason of this act. (f) This subsection shall take effect on January 1, 1962. (17) If the member recovers from disability, has his or her disability benefit terminated, reenters covered employment, and is continuously employed for a minimum of 1 year of creditable service, he or she may claim as creditable service the months during which he or she was receiving a disability benefit, upon payment of the required contributions. Contributions shall equal the total required employee and employer contribution rate during the period the retiree received retirement benefits, multiplied times his or her rate of monthly compensation prior to the commencement of disability retirement for each month of the period claimed, plus 4 percent interest until July 1, 1975, and 6.5 percent interest thereafter on such contributions, compounded annually each June 30 to the date of payment. If the member does not claim credit for all of the months he or she received disability benefits, the months claimed must be his or her most recent months of retirement. (18)(a) Definitions under survivor benefits are: 1. A dependent is a child, widow, widower, or parent of the deceased member who was receiving not less than one-half of his or her support from the deceased member at the time of the death of such member. 2. A child is a natural or legally adopted child of a member, who: a. Is under 18 years of age, or b. Is over 18 years of age but not over 22 years of age and is enrolled as a student in an accredited educational institution, or c. Is 18 years of age or older and is physically or mentally incapable of self-support, when such mental and physical incapacity occurred prior to such child obtaining the age of 18 years. Such person shall cease to be regarded as a child upon the termination of such physical or mental disability. The determination as to such physical or mental incapability shall be vested in the department. No person shall be considered a child who has married or, except as provided in sub-subparagraph 2.b. or as to a child who is physically or mentally incapable of self-support as hereinbefore set forth, has become 18 years of age. 3. A parent is a natural parent of a member and includes a lawful spouse of a natural parent. 4. A beneficiary is a person who is entitled to benefits under this subsection by reason of his or her relation to a deceased member during the lifetime of such member. (b) In addition to all other benefits to which a member shall, subject to the conditions set out below, be entitled, the beneficiary of such member shall, upon the death of such member, receive the following benefits: Minimum period of paid service of member in Florida as regular full-time teacher Beneficiaries of deceased member Benefits 1. One calendar day Widow or widower who has care of dependent child or children of deceased member. $190 per month for one child. $250 per month if more than one child, maximum benefits $250 per month. 2. One calendar day One or more dependent children if there is no surviving widow or widower. $190 per month per child; maximum benefits $250 per month if more than one child. 3. One calendar day Dependent parents 65 years or older. For each parent, $100 per month for life. 4. One calendar day Designated beneficiary and, if no designated beneficiary, then the executor or administrator of deceased member. $500 lump-sum death benefits payable only once. 5. One calendar day Dependent widow or widower 50 years of age and less than 65 years of age. $150 per month for life. 6. Ten years Widow or widower 65 years of age or older. $175 per month for life. 7. Retired member Designated beneficiary and if no designated beneficiary, then the executor or administrator of deceased retired member. $500 lump-sum death benefits payable only once. Beginning on July 1, 1971, the lump-sum death benefit, provided in item 7 above for the retired teacher, shall apply to all present and future retirees of the systems. (c) The payment of survivor benefits shall begin as of the month immediately following the death of the member except where the beneficiary has not reached the age required to receive benefits under paragraph (b), in which event the payment of survivor benefits shall begin as of the month immediately following the month in which the beneficiary reaches the required age. Provided that if death occurs during the first 3 years of employment, the payment of survivor benefits shall be reduced by the amount of monthly benefits the member’s survivors are entitled to receive under federal social security as either a survivor of the member or as a covered worker under federal social security. (d) Limitations on rights of beneficiary are: 1. The person named as beneficiary in paragraph (b) shall, in no event, be entitled to receive the benefits set out in such paragraph unless the death of the member under whom such beneficiary claims occurs within the period of time after the member has served in Florida as follows: Minimum number of years of service in Florida Period after serving in Florida in which death of member occurs 3 to 5..........2 years 6 to 9..........5 years 10 or more..........10 years 2. Upon the death of a member, the department shall make a determination of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the deceased member and shall pay survivor benefits to such beneficiary or beneficiaries beginning 1 month immediately following the death of the member except where the beneficiary has not reached the age required to receive benefits under paragraph (b), in which event the payment of survivor benefits shall begin as of the month immediately following the month in which the beneficiary reaches the required age. When required by the department, the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall file an application for survivor benefits upon forms prescribed by the department. 3. The beneficiaries of a member to receive survivor benefits are fixed by this subsection, and a member may not buy or otherwise change such benefits. He or she may, however, designate the beneficiary to receive the $500 death benefits. If a member fails to make this designation, the $500 death benefits shall be paid to his or her executor or administrator. 4. The beneficiary or beneficiaries of a member whose death occurs while he or she is in service or while he or she is receiving a disability allowance under subsection (11), shall receive survivor benefits under this subsection determined by the years of service in Florida of the deceased member as set out in paragraph (b). The requirement that the death of a member must occur within a certain period of time after service in Florida as set out in subparagraph (d)1. shall not apply to a member receiving a disability benefit at the time of his or her death. (19) Any person who hereafter elects to receive retirement benefits under s. 112.05 shall not be entitled to the retirement benefits of this chapter except for the refund of his or her accumulated contributions as provided in subsection (13); likewise any person who elects to receive retirement benefits under this chapter shall thereby become ineligible to receive retirement benefits under s. 112.05.

A member may elect to receive his or her benefits in a retirement allowance payable throughout his or her life. (2) Option two. A member may elect to receive on retirement the actuarial equivalent (at that time) of his or her retirement allowance in a reduced retirement allowance payable throughout life, with the provisions that if the member dies before he or she has received in payment of his or her annuity the amount of his or her accumulated contributions, as they were at the time of his or her retirement, the balance shall be paid to such person, if any, as he or she shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the department; otherwise, to his or her executors or administrators. (3) Option three. A member may elect at any time prior to receipt of his or her first monthly installment of retirement compensation, to receive a reduced retirement compensation with the provision that the surviving spouse shall continue to draw such reduced retirement compensation so long as he or she shall live. The amount of such reduced retirement compensation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement otherwise payable. (4) Option four. A member may elect at any time prior to receipt of his or her first monthly installment of retirement compensation, to receive a reduced retirement compensation with the provision that the surviving spouse shall continue to draw one-half of such reduced retirement compensation so long as he or she shall live. The amount of such reduced retirement compensation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement otherwise payable. (5)(a) If a member continues in service beyond the date he or she is first eligible for service retirement and does not, prior to his or her death, elect Option three or Option four, his or her spouse may, at the option of the spouse, receive either the accumulated contributions of the member at date of death or the reduced retirement compensation to which the beneficiary would have been entitled under Option three, calculated on the assumption that the member retired on his or her date of death and died immediately subsequent thereto; provided that the spouse of any member who died between July 1, 1955, and June 30, 1957, both dates inclusive, is entitled to full benefits under this subsection, and further provided that for all persons who become members of the system on or after July 1, 1963, the amount of such retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member at his or her date of death shall be determined on the basis of his or her normal retirement age as defined in s. 238.07. (b) A member who elects Option three or Option four shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate his or her spouse as beneficiary to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the member. After such benefits have commenced under Option three or Option four, the retired member may change the designation of his or her spouse as beneficiary only twice. If such a retired member remarries and wishes to make such a change, he or she may do so by filing with the department a notarized change of spouse designation form and shall notify the former spouse in writing of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of spouse designation form, the department shall adjust the member’s monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member’s current benefit. The consent of a retired member’s formerly designated spouse as beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to any member of the retirement system who has accumulated at least 10 years of service and dies prior to retirement: (a) If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has previously received a refund of the member’s accumulated contributions made to the retirement system, such spouse may pay to the department an amount equal to the sum of the amount of the deceased member’s contributions previously refunded and regular interest compounded annually on the amount of such refunded contributions from the date of refund to the date of payment to the department, and by so doing be entitled to receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c). (b) If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has not received a refund of the deceased member’s accumulated contributions, such spouse shall, upon application to the department within 30 days of the death of the member, receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c). (c) The monthly benefit payable to the spouse described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) shall be the amount which would have been payable to the deceased member’s spouse, assuming that the member retired on the date of his or her death and had selected the option in subsection (3), such benefit to be based on the ages of the spouse and member as of the date of death of the member. The benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following the payment of the aforesaid amount to the department, if paragraph (a) is applicable, or on the first day of the month following the receipt of the spouse’s application by the department, if paragraph (b) is applicable. (7) The surviving spouse or other dependent of any member whose employment is terminated by death shall, upon application to the department, be permitted to pay the required contributions for any service performed by the member which could have been claimed by the member at the time of his or her death. Such service shall be added to the creditable service of the member and shall be used in the calculation of any benefits which may be payable to the surviving spouse or other surviving dependent. (8) Upon the death of a retired member or beneficiary who is receiving monthly benefits under this chapter, the monthly benefits shall be paid through the last day of the month of death and shall terminate, or be adjusted, if applicable, as of that date in accordance with the optional form of benefit selected at the time of retirement.

      "text": "238.09 Method of financing.—All of the assets of the retirement system shall be credited, according to the purposes for which they are held, to one of four funds; namely, the Annuity Savings Trust Fund, the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund, the Expense Trust Fund, and the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund. (1) The Annuity Savings Trust Fund shall be a fund in which shall be accumulated contributions made from the salaries of members under the provisions of paragraph (c) or paragraph (f). Contribution to, payments from, the Annuity Savings Trust Fund shall be made as follows: (a) With respect to plan A, B, C, or D, upon the basis of such tables as the Department of Management Services shall adopt, and regular interest, the actuary of the retirement system shall determine for each member the proportion of earnable compensation which, when deducted from each payment of his or her prospective earnable annual compensation prior to his or her minimum service retirement age, and accumulated at regular interest until such age, shall be computed to provide at such age: 1. An annuity equal to one one-hundred-fortieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership in the case of each member electing to retire under the provisions of plan A or B. 2. An annuity equal to one one-hundred-twentieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership service in the case of each member electing to retire under the provisions of plan C. 3. An annuity equal to one one-hundredth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership service in the case of each member electing to retire under the provisions of plan D. In the case of any member who has attained his or her minimum service retirement age prior to becoming a member, the proportion of salary applicable to such member, with respect to plan A, B, C, or D, shall be the proportion computed for the age 1 year younger than his or her minimum service retirement age. (b) A member under plan E shall make contribution to the fund of 6 percent of his or her earnable compensation. (c) The department shall certify to each employer the proportion of the earnable compensation of each member who is compensated by the employer, and the employer shall cause to be deducted from the salary of each member on each and every payroll for each and every payroll period an amount equal to the proportion of the member’s earnable compensation so computed. With respect to plan A, B, C, or D, the employer shall not make any deduction for annuity purposes from the compensation of a member who has attained the age of 60 years, if such member elects not to contribute. (d) In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the department may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if a teacher was not a member on the first day of the payroll period, and to facilitate the making of deductions, it may modify any deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual salary from which said deduction is to be made. (e) The deductions provided for herein shall be made, notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein, and shall receipt in full for his or her salary or compensation; and payment of salary or compensation, less said deductions, shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits provided by this chapter. (f) In addition to the deduction from salary, as hereinbefore required, any member may, with respect to plan A, B, C, or D, subject to the approval of the division, redeposit in the Annuity Savings Trust Fund, by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount equal to the total amount which he or she previously withdrew therefrom, as provided in this chapter, or any part thereof; or any member may deposit in the Annuity Savings Trust Fund, by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution, amounts for the purchase of an additional annuity, but such additional payments shall not exceed the amount computed to provide, with his or her prospective retirement allowance, a total retirement allowance of one-half of his or her prospective average final compensation at his or her minimum service retirement age. Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of his or her accumulated contributions, except that in the case of disability retirement they shall be treated as excess contributions returnable to the member in cash or as an annuity of equivalent actuarial value and shall not be considered in computing his or her pension. (g) A member who elects to retire under plan E shall pay to the Annuity Savings Trust Fund prior to retirement or receive from the Annuity Savings Trust Fund, as the case may be, the difference between what his or her contributions, with accumulated interest, would have been under plan E and the actual contributions of the member with accumulated interest. (h) The accumulated contributions of a member returned to him or her upon withdrawal, or paid as provided in this chapter to his or her designated beneficiary, or to his or her executors or administrators in the event of his or her death, shall be paid from the Annuity Savings Trust Fund. (i) Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the Annuity Savings Trust Fund to the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund. (2) Should a beneficiary, retired on account of disability, again become a member of the retirement system, his or her accumulated contributions as of the date of retirement not paid as an annuity, shall be transferred from the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund to the Annuity Savings Trust Fund and credited to his or her individual account in the Annuity Savings Trust Fund. (3) The Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of all annuities or benefits in lieu of annuities on retired members and all pensions and other benefits payable from contributions made by the members and by the employers, from which annuities, pensions and benefits in lieu thereof shall be paid. Contributions to, and payments from, the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund, other than as set forth in subsections (2) and (3) herein, shall be made as follows: (a) On account of each member there shall be paid annually into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund, as provided for in s. 238.11, on account of the preceding year a certain percentage of his or her earnable compensation, to be known as the normal contribution, and an additional percentage of his or her earnable compensation, to be known as the accrued liability contribution. The rates percent of earnable compensation of such contributions shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system, as shown by actuarial valuation. (b) On the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the department, the actuary engaged by the department to make each valuation required by this chapter shall, during the period over which the accrued liability contribution is payable, determine, immediately after making such valuation, the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of the average new entrant, which, if contributed on the basis of his or her compensation throughout his or her entire period of service, would be sufficient to provide for the payment of any pension payable by the state on his or her account. The rate percent so determined shall be known as the normal contribution rate. After the accrued liability contribution has ceased to be payable, the normal contribution rate shall be the rate percent of the earnable compensation of all members, obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund the amount of the funds in hand to the credit of that fund and dividing the remainder by 1 percent of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted by the department and on the basis of regular interest. The normal rate of contribution shall be determined and certified to the department by the actuary after each valuation and shall continue in force until a new valuation and certification are made. (c) Immediately succeeding the first valuation, the actuary engaged by the department shall compute the rate percent of the total earnable compensation of all members which is equivalent to 4 percent of the amount of the total liability for pensions on account of all members and beneficiaries and not dischargeable by the present assets of the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund and by the aforesaid normal contribution if made on account of such members during the remainder of their active service. The rate percent, originally so determined, shall be known as the accrued liability contribution rate. (d) The total amount payable in each year into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall be not less than the sum of the rates percent known as the normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution rate, of the total earnable compensation of all members during the preceding year; provided, however that the amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be at least 3 percent greater than the preceding annual accrued liability contribution; and provided that the aggregate payment into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall be sufficient, when combined with the amount then held in the fund, to provide the benefits payable from the fund during the current year. (e) The accrued liability contribution shall be discontinued as soon as the accumulated reserve in the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall equal the present value, as actuarially computed and approved by the department, of the total liability of such fund less the present value, computed on the basis of the normal contribution rate, then in force of the prospective normal contributions to be received on account of persons who are at that time members. (4) The Expense Trust Fund shall be the fund to which shall be credited all moneys contributed for the administrative expenses of the retirement system and from which shall be paid all expenses incurred in connection with the administration and operation of the retirement system. Contribution to the Expense Trust Fund shall be made by transfer from interest earnings on investments in the Annuity Savings Trust Fund. Such transfers shall be regulated by the Legislature pursuant to budgets filed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 216. (5)(a) The survivors’ benefit fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of all survivor benefits provided for in s. 238.07(18), except refund of accumulated contributions. There shall be paid into this fund: 1. All contributions by members based on the rate of twenty-five-hundredths percent of their salary as set out in paragraph (b) of this subsection. 2. All contributions by the state to the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund. 3. All transfers from other funds as required by this subsection. (b) The department shall annually certify to each employer, at the time it makes the certification to the employer under paragraph (1)(c), the rate of twenty-five-hundredths percent to be applied by the employer to the salary of each member who is compensated by the employer, and the employer shall cause to be deducted from the salary of each member on each and every payroll for each and every payroll period an amount equal to twenty-five-hundredths percent of the member’s salary paid by the employer and the employer shall remit monthly such deducted amounts to the department which shall place the same in the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund of the Teachers’ Retirement System of the state. The amount of contributions by a member to the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund shall, in no event, be refundable to the member or his or her beneficiaries. (c) Beginning July 1, 1959, there shall be paid annually into the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund by the state on account of the preceding year a sum equal to the total amount paid into such fund by the members of the Teachers’ Retirement System of the state. (d) A member who makes contributions to the Survivors’ Benefit Trust Fund shall not thereby obtain, prior to July 1, 1959, any vested interest or right to the benefits under s. 238.07(18), and these benefits may be altered, changed or repealed by the Legislature at its 1959 session, provided that the beneficiaries of members whose deaths occur prior to July 1, 1959, shall have a vested interest in the benefits accruing to such beneficiaries under s. 238.07(18), and these rights may not be altered, changed nor repealed by the Legislature.

Commencing July 1, 1967, each employer shall also budget and set aside an amount equal to such deductions, plus, commencing January 1, 1993, an additional 3.99 percent of each payment of salary of a member, which shall be the employer contribution, except with respect to any nonprofit professional association or corporation of teachers for which the employer contribution shall be at least that amount specified in s. 238.09(3)(a); provided that such amount shall be set aside only if the state makes available to the employer, except for any nonprofit professional association or corporation, the additional funds necessary for such employer contributions. (b) Each employer shall transmit monthly to the Department of Management Services a warrant for the total amount of such deductions. Each employer shall also transmit monthly to the department a warrant for such employer contribution set aside as provided for in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The department, after making records of all such warrants, shall transmit them to the Department of Financial Services for delivery to the Chief Financial Officer, who shall collect them. (c) The state contribution shall be equal to the excess of the contributions specified under s. 238.09, over the amounts the state makes available for employer contributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection. (2) The collection of the state contribution shall be made as follows: (a) The amounts required to be paid by the state into the Teachers’ Retirement System in this chapter shall be provided therefor in the General Appropriations Act. However, in the event a sufficient amount is not included in the General Appropriations Act to meet the full amount needed to pay the retirement compensation provided for in this chapter, the additional amount needed for such retirement compensation is hereby appropriated from the General Revenue Fund as approved by the Department of Management Services. (b) The Department of Management Services shall certify one-fourth of the amount so ascertained for each year to the Chief Financial Officer on or before the last day of July, October, January, and April of each year. The Chief Financial Officer shall, on or before the first day of August, November, February, and May of each year, immediately transfer to the several funds of the retirement system the amounts due.

(b) The Department of Management Services shall certify one-fourth of the amount so ascertained for each year to the nonprofit professional association or corporation of teachers on or before the last day of July, October, January, and April of each year. The nonprofit professional association or corporation of teachers shall, on or before the first day of August, November, February, and May of each year, draw its check payable to the department for the respective amounts due the several funds of the retirement system. Upon receipt of the check, the department shall immediately transfer to the several funds of the retirement system the amounts due, provided, however, that the amounts due the several funds of the retirement system from any such association or corporation for creditable service accruing to any such member before July 1, 1947, shall be paid prior to the retirement of any such member.

However, no person who has ever been eligible to become a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System of the state shall be entitled to receive such allowance. (2) Effective July 1, 1975, whenever any person has served as a teacher in the public schools of Florida, is 70 years of age or older, and is incapacitated to do and perform any vocational work sufficient to earn a livelihood, such person shall thereafter, during the remainder of his or her life, be entitled to a monthly allowance based on years of service as follows: (a) An aggregate of 10 years but not more than 15 years, a monthly allowance of $75; (b) More than 15 years and up to 20 years, a monthly allowance of $100. No person who has ever been eligible to become a member of the Teachers’ Retirement System of the state shall be entitled to receive such allowance. The monthly allowance authorized by this subsection shall begin on July 1, 1975. (3)(a) On July 1, 1974, the director of the Division of Retirement shall adjust the monthly allowance provided for incapacitated teachers under this section by increasing said allowance by a percentage which shall be equal to the percentage change in the average cost-of-living index, as defined in chapter 121, over the period between April 1, 1967, and March 31, 1973. The percent of increase, as of July 1, 1974, shall be 25.4 percent, which is the average cost-of-living increase percentage from April 1, 1967, through March 31, 1973. (b) On July 1, 1975, and each July 1 thereafter, the Department of Management Services shall adjust the monthly allowance being paid on said date. The percentage of such adjustment shall be equal to the percentage change in the average cost-of-living index during the preceding 12-month period, April 1 through March 31, ignoring changes in the cost-of-living index which are greater than 3 percent during the preceding fiscal year. (c) On July 1, 1981, each incapacitated teacher who is receiving an allowance pursuant to this section shall receive a supplementary cost-of-living adjustment, to be applied by adjusting the incapacitated teacher’s monthly allowance to an amount equal to the sum of the monthly allowance being received on June 30, 1981, plus a percentage of this allowance, which percentage will be determined as follows: 1. For incapacitated teachers with 30 years’ service or more, the percentage shall equal the product of 1 percent multiplied by the number of complete years that have elapsed between the commencement of the allowance to such person as provided by this section and July 1, 1981. 2. For incapacitated teachers with 20 years’ service or more, but less than 30 years’ service, the percentage shall equal the product of 0.9 percent multiplied by the number of complete years that have elapsed between the commencement of the allowance to such person as provided by this section and July 1, 1981. 3.
