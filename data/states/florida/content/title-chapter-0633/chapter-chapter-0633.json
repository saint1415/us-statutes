A Contractor IV is limited to the scope of practice specified in NFPA 13D. (e) “Contractor V” means a contractor whose business is limited to the execution of contracts requiring the ability to fabricate, install, alter, repair, and service the underground piping for a fire protection system using water as the extinguishing agent beginning at the point of service as defined in this act and ending no more than 1 foot above the finished floor. A Contractor V may inspect underground piping for a water-based fire protection system under the direction of a Contractor I or Contractor II. This subsection may not be construed to include engineers or architects within the defined terms and does not limit or prohibit a licensed fire protection engineer or architect with fire protection design experience from designing any type of fire protection system. A distinction is made between system design concepts prepared by the design professional and system layout as defined in this section and typically prepared by the contractor. However, a person certified under this chapter as a Contractor I or Contractor II may design new fire protection systems of 49 or fewer sprinklers; may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition, or deletion of 49 or fewer sprinklers, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system; and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation or deletion of 249 or fewer sprinklers and the addition of up to 49 sprinklers, as long as the cumulative total number of fire sprinklers being added, relocated, or deleted does not exceed 249, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system, if there is no change of occupancy of the affected areas, as defined in the Florida Building Code and the Florida Fire Prevention Code, and there is no change in the water demand as defined in NFPA 13, “Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems,” and if the occupancy hazard classification as defined in NFPA 13 is reduced or remains the same as a result of the alteration. Conflicts between the Florida Building Code and the Florida Fire Prevention Code shall be resolved pursuant to s. 553.73(1)(d). A person certified as a Contractor I, Contractor II, or Contractor IV may design a new fire protection system or design the alteration of an existing fire protection system, the scope of which complies with NFPA 13D, “Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in One- and Two-Family Dwellings and Manufactured Homes,” as adopted by the State Fire Marshal, notwithstanding the number of fire sprinklers.
