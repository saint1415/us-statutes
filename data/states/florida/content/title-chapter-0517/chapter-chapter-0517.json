An accredited investor. A business entity must be counted as one purchaser. However, if the business entity is organized for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered and is not an accredited investor, each beneficial owner of equity securities or equity interests in the business entity must be counted as a separate purchaser. A noncontributory employee benefit plan within the meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 must be counted as one purchaser if the trustee makes all investment decisions for the plan. (11) Offers or sales of securities by an issuer in a transaction that meets all of the following conditions: (a) The offers or sales of securities are made only to persons who are, or who the issuer reasonably believes are, accredited investors.

(c) The issuer reasonably believes that all purchasers are purchasing for investment and not with the view to or for sale in connection with a distribution of the security. Any resale of a security sold in reliance on this exemption within 12 months after sale is presumed to be with a view to distribution and not for investment, except a resale pursuant to a registration statement effective under this chapter or pursuant to an exemption available under this chapter, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.

Through an electronic database that is restricted to persons who have been prequalified as accredited investors; or b. After the issuer reasonably believes that the prospective purchaser is an accredited investor. (e) The issuer does not use telephone solicitation unless, before placing the call, the issuer reasonably believes that the prospective purchaser to be solicited is an accredited investor. (f) The issuer files with the office a notice of transaction on a form prescribed by commission rule, an irrevocable written consent to service of civil process in accordance with s. 517.101, and a copy of the general announcement within 15 days after the first sale is made in this state.

(12) The isolated sale or offer for sale of securities when made by or on behalf of a bona fide owner, not the issuer or underwriter, of the securities, who disposes of such securities for the owner’s own account, and such sale is not made directly or indirectly for the benefit of the issuer or an underwriter of such securities or for the direct or indirect promotion of any scheme or enterprise with the intent of violating or evading this chapter. For purposes of this subsection, isolated offers or sales include, but are not limited to, an isolated offer or sale made by or on behalf of a bona fide owner, rather than the issuer or underwriter, of the securities if: (a) The offer or sale of securities is in a transaction satisfying all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (10)(a) and (b); or (b) The offer or sale of securities is in a transaction exempt under s. 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under Securities and Exchange Commission rules or regulations. (13) By or for the account of a pledgeholder, a secured party as defined in s. 679.1021(1), or a mortgagee selling or offering for sale or delivery in the ordinary course of business and not for the purposes of avoiding this chapter, to liquidate a bona fide debt, a security pledged in good faith as security for such debt. (14) An unsolicited purchase or sale of securities on order of, and as the agent for, another solely and exclusively by a dealer registered pursuant to s. 517.12; provided that this exemption applies solely and exclusively to such registered dealers and does not authorize or permit the purchase or sale of securities at the direction of, and as agent for, another by any person other than a dealer so registered; and provided further that such purchase or sale may not be directly or indirectly for the benefit of the issuer or an underwriter of such securities or for the direct or indirect promotion of any scheme or enterprise with the intent of violating or evading this chapter. (15) A nonissuer transaction with a federal covered adviser with investments under management in excess of $100 million acting in the exercise of discretionary authority in a signed record for the account of others. (16) The sale by or through a registered dealer of any securities option if, at the time of the sale of the option: (a) The performance of the terms of the option is guaranteed by any dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which guaranty and dealer are in compliance with such requirements or rules as may be approved or adopted by the commission; or (b)1.

The security is listed on a foreign securities exchange or foreign securities market designated by commission rule, is a security of the same issuer which is of senior or substantially equal rank to the listed security, or is a warrant or right to purchase or subscribe to any such security. (b) The commission shall consider all of the following in designating a foreign securities exchange or foreign securities market for purposes of this subsection: 1. Organization under foreign law. 2. Association with a community of dealers, financial institutions, or other professional intermediaries with an established operating history. 3. Oversight by a governmental or self-regulatory body. 4. Oversight standards set by general law. 5. Reporting of securities transactions on a regular basis to a governmental or self-regulatory body. 6. A system for exchange of price quotations through common communications media. 7. An organized clearance and settlement system. 8. Listing in Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S Rule 902, 17 C.F.R. s. 230.902, as amended. If, after an administrative hearing in compliance with ss. 120.569 and 120.57, the office finds that revocation is necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the public interest and for the protection of investors, it may revoke the designation of a foreign securities exchange or foreign securities market. (21) Other transactions exempted by commission rule upon a finding by the office that the application of s. 517.07 to a particular transaction is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the public interest and for the protection of investors due to the small dollar amount of the securities involved or the limited character of the offering. In conjunction with its adoption by rule of such exemptions, the commission may exempt persons selling or offering for sale securities in such a transaction from the registration requirements of s. 517.12. A rule adopted by the commission under this subsection may not have the effect of narrowing or limiting any exemption specified in this section.

(g) Must use all funds in accordance with the use of proceeds as disclosed to prospective investors. (5) The issuer must file a notice of the offering with the office, in writing or in electronic form, in a format prescribed by commission rule, together with a nonrefundable filing fee of $200. The filing fee must be deposited into the Regulatory Trust Fund of the office. The commission may adopt rules establishing procedures for the deposit of fees and the filing of documents by electronic means if the procedures provide the office with the information and data required by this section. A notice is effective upon receipt, by the office, of the completed form, filing fee, and an irrevocable written consent to service of civil process, similar to that provided for in s. 517.101.

The commission may require, by rule, an issuer who has filed a notice under this section to file amendments with the office. (7) The issuer may engage in general advertising and general solicitation of the offering to prospective investors. Any oral or written statements in advertising or solicitation of the offering which contain a material misstatement, or which fail to disclose material information, are subject to enforcement under this chapter. Any general advertising or other general announcement must state that the offering is limited and open only to residents of this state. (8) The issuer must provide a disclosure statement to the dealer or intermediary, as applicable; to the office at the time that the notice is filed; and to each prospective investor at least 3 days before the investor’s commitment to purchase or payment of any consideration. The disclosure statement must contain material information about the issuer and the offering, including all of the following: (a) The name, legal status, physical address, e-mail address, and website address of the issuer. (b) The names of the directors, officers, managers, managing members, and general partners and any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, and the name and ownership percentage of each person holding more than 20 percent of the issuer’s equity interests.

(e) The target offering amount and the deadline to reach the target offering amount. (f) The price to the public of the securities. (g) A description of the ownership and capital structure of the issuer, including: 1. Terms of the securities being offered and each class of security of the issuer, including how those terms may be modified, and a summary of the differences between such securities, including how the rights of the securities being offered may be materially limited, diluted, or qualified by rights of any other class of security of the issuer. 2. A description of how the exercise of the rights held by the principal equity holders of the issuer could negatively impact the purchasers of the securities being offered. (h) A statement that the security being offered is not registered under federal or state securities laws and that the securities are subject to the limitation on resale contained in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 147 or Rule 147A. (i) Any issuer plans, formal or informal, to offer additional securities in the future. (j) The risks to purchasers of the securities relating to minority ownership in the issuer. (k) A description of the financial condition of the issuer. 1. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of $500,000 or less, the financial statements of the issuer may be, but are not required to be, included. 2. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of more than $500,000, but not more than $2.5 million, the description must include financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reviewed by a certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302, who is independent of the issuer, using professional standards and procedures or standards and procedures established by commission rule for such purpose. 3. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of more than $2.5 million, the description must include audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by a certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302, who is independent of the issuer, and other requirements as the commission may establish by rule. (l) The following statement in boldface, conspicuous type on the front page of the disclosure statement: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved these securities or determined if this disclosure statement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. These securities are offered under, and will be sold in reliance upon, an exemption from the registration requirements of federal and Florida securities laws. Neither the Federal Government nor the State of Florida has reviewed the accuracy or completeness of any offering materials. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. These securities are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as specifically authorized by applicable federal and state securities laws. Investing in these securities involves a speculative risk, and investors should be able to bear the loss of their entire investment. (9) The sum of all cash and other consideration received for sales of a security under this section may not exceed $5 million, less the aggregate amount received for all sales of securities by the issuer within the 12 months preceding the first offer or sale made in reliance upon this exemption. Offers or sales to a person owning 20 percent or more of the outstanding equity interests of any class or classes of securities or to an officer, director, manager, managing member, general partner, or trustee, or a person occupying a similar status, do not count toward this limitation. (10) Unless the investor is an accredited investor, or the issuer reasonably believes that the investor is an accredited investor, the aggregate amount of securities sold by an issuer to an investor in a 12-month period may not exceed $10,000. (11) A notice-filing under this section must be summarily suspended by the office if: (a) The payment for the filing is dishonored by the financial institution upon which the funds are drawn. For purposes of s. 120.60(6), failure to pay the required notice filing fee constitutes an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. The office shall enter a final order revoking a notice-filing in which the payment for the filing is dishonored by the financial institution upon which the funds are drawn; or (b) The issuer made a material false statement in the issuer’s notice-filing. The summary suspension remains in effect until a final order is entered by the office. For purposes of s. 120.60(6), a material false statement made in the issuer’s notice-filing constitutes an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. If an issuer made a material false statement in the issuer’s notice-filing, the office must enter a final order revoking the notice-filing, issue a fine as prescribed by s. 517.191(9), and issue permanent bars under s. 517.191(10) to the issuer and all owners, officers, directors, managers, managing members, general partners, and control persons, or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function of the issuer, including title; status as a partner, trustee, sole proprietor, or similar role; and ownership percentage. (12) If the issuer employs the services of an intermediary, the intermediary must: (a) Take measures, as established by commission rule, to reduce the risk of fraud with respect to the offering. (b) Provide information on its website regarding the high risk of investment in and limitation on the resale of exempt securities and the potential for loss of an entire investment. The information must include, but need not be limited to, all of the following: 1. A description of the financial institution into which investor funds will be deposited and the conditions for the use of such funds by the issuer. 2. A description of whether financial information provided by the issuer has been audited by an independent certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302. (c) Obtain from each prospective investor a zip code or residence address, a copy of a driver license, and any other proof of residency in order for the issuer or intermediary to reasonably believe that the potential investor is a resident of this state. The commission may adopt rules authorizing additional forms of identification and prescribing the process for verifying any identification presented by the prospective investor. (d) Obtain information sufficient for the issuer or intermediary to reasonably believe that a particular prospective investor is an accredited investor. (e) Provide a monthly update for each offering, after the first full month after the date of the offering. The update must be accessible on the intermediary’s website and must display the date and amount of each sale of securities, and each cancellation of commitment to invest, in the previous calendar month. (f) Take reasonable steps to protect personal information collected from investors, as required by s. 501.171. (g) Prohibit its directors, officers, managers, managing members, general partners, employees, and agents from having any financial interest in the issuer using its services. (13) An intermediary not registered as a dealer under s. 517.12(5) may not: (a) Offer investment advice or recommendations. A refusal by an intermediary to post an offering that it deems not credible or that represents a potential for fraud may not be construed as an offer of investment advice or recommendation. (b) Solicit purchases, sales, or offers to buy securities offered or displayed on its website. (c) Compensate employees, agents, or other persons for the solicitation of, or based on the sale of, securities offered or displayed on its website. (d) Hold, manage, possess, or otherwise handle investor funds or securities. (e) Compensate promoters, finders, or lead generators for providing the intermediary with the personal identifying information of any prospective investor. (f) Engage in any other activities set forth by commission rule. (14) If the issuer does not employ a dealer or an intermediary for an offering pursuant to the exemption created under this section, the issuer must fulfill each of the obligations specified in paragraphs (12)(c)-(f). (15) Any sale made pursuant to the exemption created under this section is voidable by the purchaser within 3 days after the first tender of consideration is made by such purchaser to the issuer by notifying the issuer that the purchaser expressly voids the purchase. The purchaser’s notice to the issuer must be sent by e-mail to the issuer’s e-mail address set forth in the disclosure statement that is provided to the purchaser or purchaser’s representative or by certified mail or overnight delivery service with proof of delivery to the mailing address set forth in the disclosure statement.

      "text": "517.0614 Integration of offerings.— (1) If the safe harbors in subsection (2) do not apply in determining whether two or more offerings are to be treated as one for the purpose of registration or qualifying for an exemption from registration under this chapter, offers and sales may not be integrated if, based on the particular facts and circumstances, the issuer can establish either that each offering complies with the registration requirements of this chapter, or that an exemption from registration is available for the particular offering, provided that any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with this chapter, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of this chapter will not have the effect of avoiding integration. In making this determination: (a) For an exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, the issuer must have a reasonable belief, based on the facts and circumstances, with respect to each purchaser in the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, that the issuer or any person acting on the issuer’s behalf: 1. Did not solicit such purchaser through the use of general solicitation; or 2. Established a substantive relationship with such purchaser before the commencement of the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, provided that a purchaser previously solicited through the use of general solicitation is not deemed to have been solicited through the use of general solicitation in the current offering if, during the 45 calendar days following such previous general solicitation: a. No offer or sale of the same or similar class of securities has been made by or on behalf of the issuer, including to such purchaser; and b. The issuer or any person acting on the issuer’s behalf has not solicited such purchaser through the use of general solicitation for any other security. (b) For two or more concurrent exempt offerings permitting general solicitation, in addition to satisfying the requirements of the particular exemption relied on, general solicitation offering materials for one offering that includes information about the material terms of a concurrent offering under another exemption may constitute an offer of securities in such other offering, and therefore the offer must comply with all the requirements for, and restrictions on, offers under the exemption being relied on for such other offering, including any legend requirements and communications restrictions. (2) The integration analysis required by subsection (1) is not required if any of the following nonexclusive safe harbors apply: (a) An offering commenced more than 30 calendar days before the commencement of any other offering, or more than 30 calendar days after the termination or completion of any other offering, may not be integrated with such other offering, provided that for an exempt offering for which general solicitation is not permitted which follows by 30 calendar days or more an offering that allows general solicitation, paragraph (1)(a) applies.

(c) An issuer of offerings in which the specific business or properties cannot be described. (d) An issuer that the office determines is ineligible because the simplified circular does not provide full and fair disclosure of material information for the type of offering to be registered by the issuer. (6) All of the statements, exhibits, and documents of every kind required under this section, except properly certified public documents, shall be verified by the oath of the applicant or of the issuer in such manner and form as may be required by the commission.

(2) In making such examination or investigation, the office shall have access to and may compel the production of all the books and papers of such issuer and may administer oaths to and examine the officers of such issuer or any other person connected therewith as to its business and affairs and may also require a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of any such issuer or its income statement, or both, to be certified to by a public accountant either of this state or of any other state where the issuer’s business is located. Whenever the office deems it necessary, it may also require such balance sheet or income statement, or both, to be made more specific in such particulars as the office may require. (3) If any issuer refuses to permit an examination or investigation to be made by the office, it shall be proper ground for revocation of registration. (4) If the office deems it necessary, it may enter an order suspending the right to sell securities pending any examination or investigation, provided that the order shall state the office’s grounds for taking such action. (5) Notice of the entry of such order shall be given personally or by mail to the issuer. Before such order is made final, the issuer shall, on application, be entitled to a hearing. (6) The office may deny any request to terminate any registration or to withdraw any application for registration if the office believes that an act which would be grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation under this chapter has been committed.

The commission may establish by rule procedures for the deposit of fees and the filing of documents to be made through electronic means, if the procedures provide to the office the information and data required by this section. (2) A notice filing shall be effective upon receipt. A notice filing shall expire on December 31 of the year in which the filing became effective unless the federal covered adviser has renewed the filing on or before that date. A federal covered adviser may renew a notice filing by furnishing to the office such information that has been filed or is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the Financial Services Commission or office may require, together with a renewal fee of $200 and the payment of any amount due and owing the office pursuant to any agreement with the office.

Is a judgment creditor in an unsatisfied final judgment or a named beneficiary or victim in an unsatisfied restitution order entered on or after October 1, 2024, in which a wrongdoer was found to have violated s. 517.07 or s. 517.301; 2.

(b) The name of the judgment debtor or person ordered to pay restitution. (c) If the eligible person is a business entity, the eligible person’s type and place of organization and, as applicable, a copy, as amended, of its articles of incorporation, articles of organization, trust agreement, or partnership agreement.

That the eligible person has made all reasonable searches and inquiries to ascertain whether the judgment debtor or person ordered to pay restitution possesses real or personal property or other assets subject to being sold or applied in satisfaction of the final judgment or restitution order and, by the eligible person’s search, that the eligible person has not discovered any property or assets. 2. That the eligible person has taken necessary action on the property and assets of the wrongdoers but the final judgment or restitution order remains unsatisfied. (f) If the application is filed by the receiver, an affidavit from the receiver stating the amount of restitution owed to the eligible person on whose behalf the claim is filed; the amount of any money, property, or assets paid to the eligible person on whose behalf the claim is filed by the person over whom the receiver is appointed; and the amount of any unsatisfied portion of any eligible person’s restitution order. (g) The eligible person’s residence or domicile at the time of the violation of s. 517.07 or s. 517.301 which resulted in the eligible person’s monetary damages. (h) The amount of any unsatisfied portion of the eligible person’s final judgment or restitution order. (i) Whether an appeal has been filed. (6) If the office finds that a person is eligible for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund and if the person has complied with this section and the rules adopted under this section, the office must approve payment to such person from the fund. Within 90 days after the office’s receipt of a complete application, each eligible person or receiver must be given written notice, personally or by mail, that the office intends to approve or deny, or has approved or denied, the application for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund. (7) Upon receipt by the eligible person or receiver of notice of the office’s decision that the eligible person’s or receiver’s application for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund is approved, and before any disbursement, the eligible person shall assign to the office on a form prescribed by commission rule all right, title, and interest in the final judgment or order of restitution equal to the amount of such payment. (8) The office shall deem an application for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund abandoned if the eligible person or receiver, or any person acting on behalf of the eligible person or receiver, fails to timely complete the application as prescribed by commission rule.

      "text": "517.141 Payment from the fund.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Claimant” means a person determined eligible for payment under s. 517.131 that is approved by the office for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund. (b) “Final judgment” includes an arbitration award confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c) “Specified adult” has the same meaning as in s. 517.34(1). (2) A claimant is entitled to disbursement from the Securities Guaranty Fund in the amount equal to the lesser of: (a) The unsatisfied portion of the claimant’s final judgment or final order of restitution, but only to the extent that the final judgment or final order of restitution reflects actual or compensatory damages, excluding postjudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees; or (b)1. The sum of $15,000; or 2. If the claimant is a specified adult or if a specified adult is a beneficial owner or beneficiary of the claimant, the sum of $25,000. (3) Regardless of the number of claims or claimants involved, payments for claims are limited in the aggregate to $250,000 against any one person. If the total claim filed by a receiver on behalf of multiple claimants exceeds the aggregate limit of $250,000, the office must prorate the payment to each claimant based upon the ratio that each claimant’s individual claim bears to the total claim filed. (4) If at any time the balance in the Securities Guaranty Fund is insufficient to satisfy a valid claim or portion of a valid claim approved by the office, the office must satisfy the unpaid claim or portion of the valid claim as soon as a sufficient amount of money has been deposited into or transferred to the Securities Guaranty Fund. If more than one unsatisfied claim is outstanding, the claims must be paid in the sequence in which the claims were approved by final order of the office, which final order is not subject to an appeal or other pending proceeding. (5) All payments and disbursements made from the Securities Guaranty Fund must be made by the Chief Financial Officer, or his or her designee, upon authorization by the office. The office shall submit such authorization within 30 days after the approval of an eligible person for payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund. (6) Individual claims filed by persons owning the same joint account, or claims arising from any other type of account on which more than one name appears, must be treated as the claims of one eligible claimant with respect to payment from the Securities Guaranty Fund. If a claimant who has obtained a final judgment or final order of restitution that qualifies for disbursement under s. 517.131 has maintained more than one account with the person who is the subject of the claims, for purposes of disbursement of the Securities Guaranty Fund, all such accounts, whether joint or individual, must be considered as one account and entitle such claimant to only one distribution from the fund. To the extent that a claimant obtains more than one final judgment or final order of restitution against a person arising out of the same transactions, occurrences, or conduct or out of such person’s handling of the claimant’s account, the final judgments or final orders of restitution must be consolidated for purposes of this section and entitle the claimant to only one disbursement from the fund. (7) If the final judgment or final order of restitution that gave rise to the claim is overturned in any appeal or in any collateral proceeding, the claimant must reimburse the Securities Guaranty Fund all amounts paid from the fund to the claimant on the claim. If the claimant satisfies the final judgment or final order of restitution, the claimant must reimburse the Securities Guaranty Fund all amounts paid from the fund to the claimant on the claim. Such reimbursement must be paid to the Department of Financial Services within 60 days after the final resolution of the appellate or collateral proceedings or the satisfaction of the final judgment or order of restitution, with the 60-day period commencing on the date the final order or decision is entered in such proceedings. (8) If a claimant receives payments in excess of that which is permitted under this chapter, the claimant must reimburse the Securities Guaranty Fund such excess within 60 days after the claimant receives such excess payment or after the payment is determined to be in excess of that permitted by law, whichever is later. (9) A claimant who knowingly and willfully files or causes to be filed an application under s. 517.131 or documents supporting the application, any of which contain false, incomplete, or misleading information in any material aspect, forfeits all payments from the Securities Guaranty Fund and commits a violation of s. 517.301(1)(c). (10) The Department of Financial Services may institute legal proceedings to enforce compliance with this section and with s. 517.131 to recover moneys owed to the Securities Guaranty Fund, and is entitled to recover interest, costs, and attorney fees in any action brought pursuant to this section in which the department prevails.

The disciplinary guidelines shall distinguish minor violations from violations that endanger the public health, safety, or welfare; provide reasonable notice to the public of penalties that may be imposed for proscribed conduct; and ensure that penalties are imposed in a consistent manner by the office. (b) The commission shall identify mitigating and aggravating circumstances by rule that allow the office to impose a penalty other than that specified in the guidelines. (2) The commission shall adopt by rule disqualifying periods pursuant to which an applicant will be disqualified from eligibility for registration based upon criminal convictions, pleas of nolo contendere, or pleas of guilt, regardless of whether adjudication was withheld, by the applicant; any partner, member, officer, or director of the applicant or any person having a similar status or performing similar functions; or any person directly or indirectly controlling the applicant. (a) The disqualifying periods shall be 15 years for a felony and 5 years for a misdemeanor. (b) The disqualifying periods shall be related to crimes involving registration as a dealer, investment adviser, issuer of securities, or associated person or the application for such registration or involving moral turpitude or fraudulent or dishonest dealing. (c) The rules may also address mitigating factors, an additional waiting period based upon dates of imprisonment or community supervision, an additional waiting period based upon commitment of multiple crimes, and other factors reasonably related to the consideration of an applicant’s criminal history. (d) An applicant is not eligible for registration until the expiration of the disqualifying period set by rule. Section 112.011 does not apply to the registration provisions under this chapter.

Each person making the sale and every director, officer, partner, or agent of or for the seller, if the director, officer, partner, or agent has personally participated or aided in making the sale, is jointly and severally liable to the purchaser in an action for rescission, if the purchaser still owns the security, or for damages, if the purchaser has sold the security. No purchaser otherwise entitled will have the benefit of this subsection who has refused or failed, within 30 days after receipt, to accept an offer made in writing by the seller, if the purchaser has not sold the security, to take back the security in question and to refund the full amount paid by the purchaser or, if the purchaser has sold the security, to pay the purchaser an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid for the security and the amount received by the purchaser on the sale of the security, together, in either case, with interest on the full amount paid for the security by the purchaser at the legal rate, pursuant to s. 55.03, for the period from the date of payment by the purchaser to the date of repayment, less the amount of any income received by the purchaser on the security. (2) Any person purchasing or selling a security in violation of s. 517.301, and every director, officer, partner, or agent of or for the purchaser or seller, if the director, officer, partner, or agent has personally participated or aided in making the sale or purchase, is jointly and severally liable to the person selling the security to or purchasing the security from such person in an action for rescission, if the plaintiff still owns the security, or for damages, if the plaintiff has sold the security. (3) For purposes of any action brought under this section, a control person who controls any person found to have violated any provision specified in subsection (1) is jointly and severally liable with, and to the same extent as, such controlled person in any action brought under this section unless the control person can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act that constitutes the violation or cause of action. (4) In an action for rescission: (a) A purchaser may recover the consideration paid for the security or investment, plus interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of purchase, less the amount of any income received by the purchaser on the security or investment upon tender of the security or investment. (b) A seller may recover the security upon tender of the consideration paid for the security, plus interest at the legal rate from the date of purchase, less the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security. (5) In an action for damages brought by a purchaser of a security or investment, the plaintiff must recover an amount equal to the difference between: (a) The consideration paid for the security or investment, plus interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of purchase; and (b) The value of the security or investment at the time it was disposed of by the plaintiff, plus the amount of any income received on the security or investment by the plaintiff. (6) In an action for damages brought by a seller of a security, the plaintiff shall recover an amount equal to the difference between: (a) The value of the security at the time of the complaint, plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security; and (b) The consideration received for the security, plus interest at the legal rate from the date of sale. (7) In any action brought under this section, including an appeal, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party unless the court finds that the award of such fees would be unjust.

      "number": "517.34",
      "heading": "Protection of specified adults.",
      "text": "517.34 Protection of specified adults.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Financial exploitation” means the wrongful or unauthorized taking, withholding, appropriation, or use of money, assets, or property of a specified adult; or any act or omission by a person, including through the use of a power of attorney, guardianship, or conservatorship of a specified adult, to: 1. Obtain control over the specified adult’s money, assets, or property through deception, intimidation, or undue influence to deprive him or her of the ownership, use, benefit, or possession of the money, assets, or property; or 2. Convert the specified adult’s money, assets, or property to deprive him or her of the ownership, use, benefit, or possession of the money, assets, or property. (b) “Specified adult” means a natural person 65 years of age or older, or a vulnerable adult as defined in s. 415.102. (c) “Trusted contact” means a natural person 18 years of age or older who the account owner has expressly identified and who is recorded in a dealer’s or investment adviser’s books and records as the person who may be contacted about the account. (2) The Legislature finds that many persons in this state, because of age or disability, are at increased risk of financial exploitation and loss of their assets, funds, investments, and investment accounts. The Legislature further finds that senior investors in this state are at a statistically higher risk of being targeted for financial exploitation, regardless of diminished capacity or other disability, because of their accumulation of substantial assets and wealth compared to younger age groups. In enacting this section, the Legislature recognizes the freedom of specified adults to manage their assets, make investment choices, and spend their funds, and intends that such rights may not be infringed absent a reasonable belief of financial exploitation as provided in this section. The Legislature therefore intends to provide for the prevention of financial exploitation of such persons. The Legislature intends to encourage the constructive involvement of securities dealers, investment advisers, and associated persons who take action based upon the reasonable belief that specified adults with investment accounts have been or are the subject of financial exploitation, and to provide securities dealers, investment advisers, and associated persons immunity from liability for taking actions as authorized herein. The Legislature intends to balance the rights of specified adults to direct and control their assets, funds, and investments and exercise their constitutional rights consistent with due process with the need to provide securities dealers, investment advisers, and associated persons the ability to place narrow, time-limited restrictions on these rights in an effort to decrease specified adults’ risk of loss due to abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation. (3) A dealer or investment adviser may delay a disbursement or transaction of funds or securities from an account of a specified adult or an account for which a specified adult is a beneficiary or beneficial owner if all of the following apply: (a) The dealer or investment adviser reasonably believes that financial exploitation of the specified adult has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted in connection with the disbursement or transaction. (b) Not later than 3 business days after the date on which the delay was first placed, the dealer or investment adviser notifies in writing all parties authorized to transact business on the account and any trusted contact on the account, using the contact information provided for the account, with the exception of any party the dealer or investment adviser reasonably believes has engaged in, is engaging in, has attempted to engage in, or will attempt to engage in the suspected financial exploitation of the specified adult. The notice, which may be provided electronically, must provide the reason for the delay. (c) Not later than 3 business days after the date on which the delay was first placed, the dealer or investment adviser notifies the office of the delay electronically on a form prescribed by commission rule. The form must be consistent with the purposes of this section and may include only the following information: 1. The date on which the notice is submitted to the office. 2. The date on which the delay was first placed. 3. The following information about the specified adult: a. Gender. b. Age. c. Zip code of residence address. 4. The following information about the dealer or investment adviser who placed the delay: a. Name. b. Title. c. Firm name. d. Business address. 5. A section with the following questions for which the only allowable responses are “Yes” or “No”: a. Is financial exploitation of a specified adult suspected in connection with a disbursement or transaction? b. Are funds currently at risk of being lost? The form must contain substantially the following statement in conspicuous type: “The office may take disciplinary action against any person making a knowing and willful misrepresentation on this form.” (d) The dealer or investment adviser immediately initiates an internal review of the facts and circumstances that caused the dealer or investment adviser to reasonably believe that the financial exploitation of the specified adult has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted. (4) A delay on a disbursement or transaction under subsection (3) expires 15 business days after the date on which the delay was first placed. However, the dealer or investment adviser may extend the delay for up to 30 additional business days if the dealer’s or investment adviser’s review of the available facts and circumstances continues to support such dealer’s or investment adviser’s reasonable belief that financial exploitation of the specified adult has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted. A dealer or investment adviser that extends a delay must notify the office on a form prescribed by commission rule not later than 3 business days after the date on which the extension was applied. The notice must identify the dealer or investment adviser that extended the delay and the date on which the delay was originally made. The length of the delay may be shortened or extended at any time by a court of competent jurisdiction. This subsection does not prevent a dealer or investment adviser from terminating a delay after communication with the parties authorized to transact business on the account and any trusted contact on the account. (5) A dealer or investment adviser must make available to the office, upon request, all records relating to a delay placed by the dealer or investment adviser pursuant to this section, as prescribed by commission rule. (6) A dealer, an investment adviser, or an associated person who in good faith and exercising reasonable care complies with this section is immune from any administrative or civil liability that might otherwise arise from such delay in a disbursement or transaction in accordance with this section. This subsection does not supersede or diminish any immunity granted under chapter 415. (7) Before placing a delay on a disbursement or transaction pursuant to this section, a dealer or an investment adviser must do all of the following: (a) Develop training policies or programs reasonably designed to educate associated persons on issues pertaining to financial exploitation. (b) Conduct training for all associated persons at least annually and maintain a written record of all training conducted. (c) Develop, maintain, and enforce written procedures regarding the manner in which suspected financial exploitation is reviewed internally, including, if applicable, the manner in which suspected financial exploitation is required to be reported to supervisory personnel. (8) Absent a reasonable belief of financial exploitation as provided in this section, this section does not alter a dealer’s, an investment adviser’s, or an associated person’s obligation to comply with instructions from a client to buy or sell securities, disburse funds or transfer securities from an account, close an account, or transfer an account to another dealer, investment adviser, or associated person. (9) This section does not create new rights for or impose new obligations on a dealer, an investment adviser, or an associated person under other applicable law. This section does not limit the right of a dealer, an investment adviser, or an associated person to otherwise refuse or place a delay on a disbursement or transaction under other applicable law or under an applicable customer agreement.

(3) The offer or sale of securities under this section must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the federal exemption for intrastate offerings in s. 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. s. 77c(a)(11), as amended; Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 147, 17 C.F.R. s. 230.147, as amended; or Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 147A, 17. C.F.R. s. 230.147A, as amended. (4) An issuer: (a) Must be a for-profit business entity that maintains its principal place of business and derives its revenues primarily from operations in this state. (b) Must conduct transactions for an offering of $2.5 million or more through a dealer registered with the office or an intermediary registered under s. 517.12. For an offering of less than $2.5 million, the issuer may, but is not required to, use such a dealer or intermediary. (c) May not be, before or as a result of the offering, an investment company as defined in s. 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. s. 80a-3, as amended, or subject to the reporting requirements of s. 13 or s. 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. s. 78m or s. 78o(d), as amended. (d) May not be a business entity that has an undefined business operation, lacks a business plan, lacks a stated investment goal for the funds being raised, or plans to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unspecified business entity. (e) May not be subject to a disqualification established by the commission or a disqualification described in s. 517.0616 or s. 517.1611. Each director, officer, manager, managing member, or general partner, or person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, or person holding more than 20 percent of the equity interest of the issuer, is subject to this paragraph. (f) Must deposit all funds received from investors in an account in a federally insured financial institution authorized to do business in this state and maintain all such funds in the account until the target offering amount has been reached or the offering has been terminated or has expired. If the target offering amount has not been reached within the period specified by the issuer in the disclosure statement provided to investors, or if the offering is terminated or expires, the issuer must refund invested funds to all investors within 10 business days after such occurrence. (g) Must use all funds in accordance with the use of proceeds as disclosed to prospective investors. (5) The issuer must file a notice of the offering with the office, in writing or in electronic form, in a format prescribed by commission rule, together with a nonrefundable filing fee of $200. The filing fee must be deposited into the Regulatory Trust Fund of the office. The commission may adopt rules establishing procedures for the deposit of fees and the filing of documents by electronic means if the procedures provide the office with the information and data required by this section. A notice is effective upon receipt, by the office, of the completed form, filing fee, and an irrevocable written consent to service of civil process, similar to that provided for in s. 517.101. The notice may be terminated by filing with the office a notice of termination. The notice and offering expire 12 months after filing the notice with the office and are not eligible for renewal. The notice must: (a) Be filed with the office at least 10 days before the issuer commences an offering of securities or the offering is displayed on a website of an intermediary in reliance upon the exemption provided by this section.

(f) If applicable, include the intermediary’s website address where the issuer’s securities will be offered.

(6) The issuer must amend the notice form within 10 business days after any material information contained in the notice becomes inaccurate. The commission may require, by rule, an issuer who has filed a notice under this section to file amendments with the office. (7) The issuer may engage in general advertising and general solicitation of the offering to prospective investors. Any oral or written statements in advertising or solicitation of the offering which contain a material misstatement, or which fail to disclose material information, are subject to enforcement under this chapter. Any general advertising or other general announcement must state that the offering is limited and open only to residents of this state. (8) The issuer must provide a disclosure statement to the dealer or intermediary, as applicable; to the office at the time that the notice is filed; and to each prospective investor at least 3 days before the investor’s commitment to purchase or payment of any consideration. The disclosure statement must contain material information about the issuer and the offering, including all of the following: (a) The name, legal status, physical address, e-mail address, and website address of the issuer. (b) The names of the directors, officers, managers, managing members, and general partners and any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, and the name and ownership percentage of each person holding more than 20 percent of the issuer’s equity interests. (c) A description of the current business and anticipated business plan of the issuer. (d) A description of the stated purpose and intended use of the proceeds of the offering. (e) The target offering amount and the deadline to reach the target offering amount. (f) The price to the public of the securities. (g) A description of the ownership and capital structure of the issuer, including: 1. Terms of the securities being offered and each class of security of the issuer, including how those terms may be modified, and a summary of the differences between such securities, including how the rights of the securities being offered may be materially limited, diluted, or qualified by rights of any other class of security of the issuer. 2. A description of how the exercise of the rights held by the principal equity holders of the issuer could negatively impact the purchasers of the securities being offered. (h) A statement that the security being offered is not registered under federal or state securities laws and that the securities are subject to the limitation on resale contained in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 147 or Rule 147A. (i) Any issuer plans, formal or informal, to offer additional securities in the future. (j) The risks to purchasers of the securities relating to minority ownership in the issuer. (k) A description of the financial condition of the issuer. 1. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of $500,000 or less, the financial statements of the issuer may be, but are not required to be, included. 2. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of more than $500,000, but not more than $2.5 million, the description must include financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reviewed by a certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302, who is independent of the issuer, using professional standards and procedures or standards and procedures established by commission rule for such purpose. 3. For offerings that, in combination with all other offerings of the issuer within the preceding 12-month period, have offering amounts of more than $2.5 million, the description must include audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by a certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302, who is independent of the issuer, and other requirements as the commission may establish by rule. (l) The following statement in boldface, conspicuous type on the front page of the disclosure statement: Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved these securities or determined if this disclosure statement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. These securities are offered under, and will be sold in reliance upon, an exemption from the registration requirements of federal and Florida securities laws. Neither the Federal Government nor the State of Florida has reviewed the accuracy or completeness of any offering materials. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. These securities are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as specifically authorized by applicable federal and state securities laws. Investing in these securities involves a speculative risk, and investors should be able to bear the loss of their entire investment. (9) The sum of all cash and other consideration received for sales of a security under this section may not exceed $5 million, less the aggregate amount received for all sales of securities by the issuer within the 12 months preceding the first offer or sale made in reliance upon this exemption. Offers or sales to a person owning 20 percent or more of the outstanding equity interests of any class or classes of securities or to an officer, director, manager, managing member, general partner, or trustee, or a person occupying a similar status, do not count toward this limitation. (10) Unless the investor is an accredited investor, or the issuer reasonably believes that the investor is an accredited investor, the aggregate amount of securities sold by an issuer to an investor in a 12-month period may not exceed $10,000. (11) A notice-filing under this section must be summarily suspended by the office if: (a) The payment for the filing is dishonored by the financial institution upon which the funds are drawn. For purposes of s. 120.60(6), failure to pay the required notice filing fee constitutes an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. The office shall enter a final order revoking a notice-filing in which the payment for the filing is dishonored by the financial institution upon which the funds are drawn; or (b) The issuer made a material false statement in the issuer’s notice-filing. The summary suspension remains in effect until a final order is entered by the office. For purposes of s. 120.60(6), a material false statement made in the issuer’s notice-filing constitutes an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. If an issuer made a material false statement in the issuer’s notice-filing, the office must enter a final order revoking the notice-filing, issue a fine as prescribed by s. 517.191(9), and issue permanent bars under s. 517.191(10) to the issuer and all owners, officers, directors, managers, managing members, general partners, and control persons, or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function of the issuer, including title; status as a partner, trustee, sole proprietor, or similar role; and ownership percentage. (12) If the issuer employs the services of an intermediary, the intermediary must: (a) Take measures, as established by commission rule, to reduce the risk of fraud with respect to the offering. (b) Provide information on its website regarding the high risk of investment in and limitation on the resale of exempt securities and the potential for loss of an entire investment. The information must include, but need not be limited to, all of the following: 1. A description of the financial institution into which investor funds will be deposited and the conditions for the use of such funds by the issuer. 2. A description of whether financial information provided by the issuer has been audited by an independent certified public accountant, as defined in s. 473.302. (c) Obtain from each prospective investor a zip code or residence address, a copy of a driver license, and any other proof of residency in order for the issuer or intermediary to reasonably believe that the potential investor is a resident of this state. The commission may adopt rules authorizing additional forms of identification and prescribing the process for verifying any identification presented by the prospective investor. (d) Obtain information sufficient for the issuer or intermediary to reasonably believe that a particular prospective investor is an accredited investor. (e) Provide a monthly update for each offering, after the first full month after the date of the offering. The update must be accessible on the intermediary’s website and must display the date and amount of each sale of securities, and each cancellation of commitment to invest, in the previous calendar month. (f) Take reasonable steps to protect personal information collected from investors, as required by s. 501.171. (g) Prohibit its directors, officers, managers, managing members, general partners, employees, and agents from having any financial interest in the issuer using its services. (13) An intermediary not registered as a dealer under s. 517.12(5) may not: (a) Offer investment advice or recommendations. A refusal by an intermediary to post an offering that it deems not credible or that represents a potential for fraud may not be construed as an offer of investment advice or recommendation. (b) Solicit purchases, sales, or offers to buy securities offered or displayed on its website. (c) Compensate employees, agents, or other persons for the solicitation of, or based on the sale of, securities offered or displayed on its website. (d) Hold, manage, possess, or otherwise handle investor funds or securities. (e) Compensate promoters, finders, or lead generators for providing the intermediary with the personal identifying information of any prospective investor. (f) Engage in any other activities set forth by commission rule. (14) If the issuer does not employ a dealer or an intermediary for an offering pursuant to the exemption created under this section, the issuer must fulfill each of the obligations specified in paragraphs (12)(c)-(f). (15) Any sale made pursuant to the exemption created under this section is voidable by the purchaser within 3 days after the first tender of consideration is made by such purchaser to the issuer by notifying the issuer that the purchaser expressly voids the purchase. The purchaser’s notice to the issuer must be sent by e-mail to the issuer’s e-mail address set forth in the disclosure statement that is provided to the purchaser or purchaser’s representative or by certified mail or overnight delivery service with proof of delivery to the mailing address set forth in the disclosure statement.
