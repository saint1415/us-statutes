(2) “Annual report” means a detailed report, including maps and aerial photographs, submitted for each mine, which describes and delineates mining operations and reclamation or restoration activities undertaken in the previous calendar year. (3) “Conceptual reclamation plan” means a graphic and written description of general activities to be undertaken across the whole mine to comply with the reclamation standards and criteria contained in this part. (4) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection. (5) “Mine” means an area of land upon which mining operations have been conducted, are being conducted, or are planned to be conducted, as the term is commonly used in the trade. (6) “Mining operations” means those physical activities, other than prospecting and site preparation, which are necessary for extraction, waste disposal, storage, or dam maintenance prior to abandonment. (7) “New mine,” as used in s. 378.209, means a mine for which the operator first became obligated to pay a severance tax for the extraction of minerals therefrom after July 1, 1975. (8) “Operator” means the person engaged, or seeking to be engaged, in the severance of solid minerals, or any other person who is obligated to reclaim mined lands pursuant to s. 211.32(1). For purposes of s. 378.208 relating to financial responsibility, the term “operator” includes a parent, its subsidiary, or division. (9) “Reclamation” means the reshaping of lands in a manner that meets the reclamation criteria and standards contained in this part. (10) “Restoration” means the recontouring and revegetation of lands in a manner, consistent with the criteria and standards established under this part, which will maintain or improve the water quality and function of the biological systems present at the site prior to mining. In requiring restoration of an area, the department must recognize technological limitations and economic considerations. For example, restoration must be considered accomplished when immature trees are used; mature trees are not required to be replanted in areas where mature trees were removed to allow mining. (11) “Revegetation” means, in reclaimed areas, a cover of vegetation consistent with the criteria and standards established pursuant to this part and consistent with the land form created and the future land uses. In restored areas, it means a cover of vegetation that is designed to return the restored area to the condition in existence prior to mining. (12) “Secretary” means the Secretary of Environmental Protection. History.—s. 1, ch. 86-294; ss. 319, 505, ch. 94-356.

Variances and renewals thereof may be granted for any one of the following reasons: (a) There is no practicable means known or available to comply with the provisions of this part or the rules adopted pursuant thereto. (b) Compliance with a particular requirement or requirements from which a variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which must be spread over a considerable period of time. A variance granted for this reason shall prescribe a timetable for the taking of the measures required. (c) To relieve or prevent hardship, including economic hardship, of a kind other than those provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b). (d) To accommodate specific phosphate mining, processing or chemical plant uses that otherwise would be inconsistent with the requirements of this part. (e) To provide for an experimental technique that would advance the knowledge of reclamation and restoration methods. (f) To accommodate projects, including those proposing offsite mitigation, that provide a significant regional benefit for wildlife and the environment. (g) To accommodate reclamation that provides water supply development or water resource development not inconsistent with the applicable regional water supply plan approved pursuant to s. 373.709, provided adverse impacts are not caused to the water resources in the basin. A variance may also be granted from the requirements of part IV of chapter 373, or the rules adopted thereunder, when a project provides an improvement in water availability in the basin and does not cause adverse impacts to water resources in the basin. (2) Consideration of a variance pursuant to this section shall be based on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each individual request. (3) The department shall publish a notice of proposed agency action in the Florida Administrative Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected, and the department shall afford an opportunity for a hearing on each application for a variance, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 120. If no request for a hearing is filed with the department within 14 days of publication of the notice, the department may proceed to final agency action without a hearing. (4) Variances issued pursuant to this section may be for the life of the facility or for such shorter period of time as may be appropriate. Variances issued for a period of 5 years or more shall be reviewed by the secretary at least every 5 years to ensure that the factors justifying the issuance of the variance have not changed so as to make the variance unnecessary. (5) The department may prescribe appropriate conditions, including time limits, to the granting of a variance.
