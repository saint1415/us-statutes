      "text": "456.003 Legislative intent; requirements.— (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that persons desiring to engage in any lawful profession regulated by the department shall be entitled to do so as a matter of right if otherwise qualified. (2) The Legislature further believes that such professions shall be regulated only for the preservation of the health, safety, and welfare of the public under the police powers of the state. Such professions shall be regulated when: (a) Their unregulated practice can harm or endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the public, and when the potential for such harm is recognizable and clearly outweighs any anticompetitive impact which may result from regulation. (b) The public is not effectively protected by other means, including, but not limited to, other state statutes, local ordinances, or federal legislation. (c) Less restrictive means of regulation are not available. (3) It is further legislative intent that the use of the term “profession” with respect to those activities licensed and regulated by the department shall not be deemed to mean that such activities are not occupations for other purposes in state or federal law. (4)(a) Neither the department nor any board may create unreasonably restrictive and extraordinary standards that deter qualified persons from entering the various professions. Neither the department nor any board may take any action that tends to create or maintain an economic condition that unreasonably restricts competition, except as specifically provided by law. (b) Neither the department nor any board may create a regulation that has an unreasonable effect on job creation or job retention in the state or that places unreasonable restrictions on the ability of individuals who seek to practice or who are practicing a profession or occupation to find employment. (c) The Legislature shall evaluate proposals to increase the regulation of regulated professions or occupations to determine the effect of increased regulation on job creation or retention and employment opportunities. (5) Policies adopted by the department shall ensure that all expenditures are made in the most cost-effective manner to maximize competition, minimize licensure costs, and maximize public access to meetings conducted for the purpose of professional regulation. The long-range planning function of the department shall be implemented to facilitate effective operations and to eliminate inefficiencies. (6) Unless expressly and specifically granted in statute, the duties conferred on the boards do not include the enlargement, modification, or contravention of the lawful scope of practice of the profession regulated by the boards. This subsection shall not prohibit the boards, or the department when there is no board, from taking disciplinary action or issuing a declaratory statement.

(2) How and why the various professions are regulated. (3) Whether there is a need to continue regulation, and to what degree. (4) Whether or not consumer protection is adequate, and how it can be improved. (5) Whether there is consistency between the various practice acts.

Fingerprints must be submitted electronically to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing, and the Department of Law Enforcement shall forward the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for national processing. Each board, or the department if there is no board, must screen the results to determine whether an applicant meets licensure requirements. For any subsequent renewal of the applicant’s license which requires a national criminal history check, the department shall request the Department of Law Enforcement to forward the retained fingerprints of the applicant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation unless the fingerprints are enrolled in the national retained print arrest notification program. (2) All fingerprints submitted to the Department of Law Enforcement as required under subsection (1) shall be retained by the Department of Law Enforcement as provided under s. 943.05(2)(g) and (h) and (3) and enrolled in the national retained print arrest notification program at the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the Department of Law Enforcement begins participation in the program. The department shall notify the Department of Law Enforcement regarding any person whose fingerprints have been retained but who is no longer licensed. (3) The costs of fingerprint processing, including the cost for retaining fingerprints, shall be borne by the applicant subject to the background screening. (4) All fingerprints received under this section shall be entered into the Care Provider Background Screening Clearinghouse as provided in s. 435.12.

To that end, the board, or the department when there is no board, may adopt rules to permit practice by retired professionals as limited licensees under this section. (2) Any person desiring to obtain a limited license, when permitted by rule, shall submit to the board, or the department when there is no board, an application and fee, not to exceed $300, and an affidavit stating that the applicant has been licensed to practice in any jurisdiction in the United States for at least 10 years in the profession for which the applicant seeks a limited license. The affidavit shall also state that the applicant has retired or intends to retire from the practice of that profession and intends to practice only pursuant to the restrictions of the limited license granted pursuant to this section. If the applicant for a limited license submits a notarized statement from the employer stating that the applicant will not receive monetary compensation for any service involving the practice of her or his profession, the application and all licensure fees shall be waived. (3) The board, or the department when there is no board, may deny limited licensure to an applicant who has committed, or is under investigation or prosecution for, any act which would constitute the basis for discipline pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or the applicable practice act. (4) The recipient of a limited license may practice only in the employ of public agencies or institutions or nonprofit agencies or institutions which meet the requirements of s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and which provide professional liability coverage for acts or omissions of the limited licensee. A limited licensee may provide services only to the indigent, underserved, or critical need populations within the state.

      "text": "456.017 Examinations.— (1)(a) The department shall provide, contract, or approve services for the development, preparation, administration, scoring, score reporting, and evaluation of all examinations, in consultation with the appropriate board. The department shall certify that examinations developed and approved by the department adequately and reliably measure an applicant’s ability to practice the profession regulated by the department. After an examination developed or approved by the department has been administered, the board, or the department when there is no board, may reject any question which does not reliably measure the general areas of competency specified in the rules of the board. The department may contract for the preparation, administration, scoring, score reporting, and evaluation of examinations, when such services are available and approved by the board. (b) For each examination developed by the department or contracted vendor, to the extent not otherwise specified by statute, the board, or the department when there is no board, shall by rule specify the general areas of competency to be covered by each examination, the relative weight to be assigned in grading each area tested, and the score necessary to achieve a passing grade. The department shall assess fees to cover the actual cost for any purchase, development, validation, administration, and defense of required examinations. This subsection does not apply to national examinations approved and administered pursuant to paragraph (c). If a practical examination is deemed to be necessary, the rules shall specify the criteria by which examiners are to be selected, the grading criteria to be used by the examiner, the relative weight to be assigned in grading each criterion, and the score necessary to achieve a passing grade. When a mandatory standardization exercise for a practical examination is required by law, the board, or the department when there is no board, may conduct such exercise. Therefore, board members, or employees of the department when there is no board, may serve as examiners at a practical examination with the consent of the board or department, as appropriate. (c) The board, or the department when there is no board, shall approve by rule the use of one or more national examinations that the department has certified as meeting requirements of national examinations and generally accepted testing standards pursuant to department rules. 1. Providers of examinations seeking certification shall pay the actual costs incurred by the department in making a determination regarding the certification. The name and number of a candidate may be provided to a national contractor for the limited purpose of preparing the grade tape and information to be returned to the board or department; or, to the extent otherwise specified by rule, the candidate may apply directly to the vendor of the national examination and supply test score information to the department. The department may delegate to the board the duty to provide and administer the examination. Any national examination approved by a board, or the department when there is no board, prior to October 1, 1997, is deemed certified under this paragraph. 2. Neither the board nor the department may administer a state-developed written examination if a national examination has been certified by the department. The examination may be administered electronically if adequate security measures are used, as determined by rule of the department. 3. The board, or the department when there is no board, may administer a state-developed practical or clinical examination, as required by the applicable practice act, if all costs of development, purchase, validation, administration, review, and defense are paid by the examination candidate prior to the administration of the examination. If a national practical or clinical examination is available and certified by the department pursuant to this section, the board, or the department when there is no board, may administer the national examination. 4. It is the intent of the Legislature to reduce the costs associated with state examinations and to encourage the use of national examinations whenever possible. (d) Each board, or the department when there is no board, shall adopt rules regarding the security and monitoring of examinations. The department shall implement those rules adopted by the respective boards. In order to maintain the security of examinations, the department may employ the procedures set forth in s. 456.065 to seek fines and injunctive relief against an examinee who violates the provisions of s. 456.018 or the rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph. The department, or any agent thereof, may, for the purposes of investigation, confiscate any written, photographic, or recording material or device in the possession of the examinee at the examination site which the department deems necessary to enforce such provisions or rules. The scores of candidates who have taken state-developed examinations shall be provided to the candidates electronically using a candidate identification number, and the department shall post the aggregate scores on the department’s website without identifying the names of the candidates. (e) If the professional board with jurisdiction over an examination concurs, the department may, for a fee, share with any other state’s licensing authority or a national testing entity an examination or examination item bank developed by or for the department unless prohibited by a contract entered into by the department for development or purchase of the examination. The department, with the concurrence of the appropriate board, shall establish guidelines that ensure security of a shared exam and shall require that any other state’s licensing authority comply with those guidelines. Those guidelines shall be approved by the appropriate professional board. All fees paid by the user shall be applied to the department’s examination and development program for professions regulated by this chapter. (f) The department may adopt rules necessary to administer this subsection. (2) For each examination developed by the department or a contracted vendor, the board, or the department when there is no board, shall adopt rules providing for reexamination of any applicants who failed an examination developed by the department or a contracted vendor. If both a written and a practical examination are given, an applicant shall be required to retake only the portion of the examination on which the applicant failed to achieve a passing grade, if the applicant successfully passes that portion within a reasonable time, as determined by rule of the board, or the department when there is no board, of passing the other portion. Except for national examinations approved and administered pursuant to this section, the department shall provide procedures for applicants who fail an examination developed by the department or a contracted vendor to review their examination questions, answers, papers, grades, and grading key for the questions the candidate answered incorrectly or, if not feasible, the parts of the examination failed. Applicants shall bear the actual cost for the department to provide examination review pursuant to this subsection. An applicant may waive in writing the confidentiality of the applicant’s examination grades. Notwithstanding any other provisions, only candidates who fail an examination with a score that is less than 10 percent below the minimum score required to pass the examination shall be entitled to challenge the validity of the examination at hearing. (3) For each examination developed or administered by the department or a contracted vendor, an accurate record of each applicant’s examination questions, answers, papers, grades, and grading key shall be kept for a period of not less than 2 years immediately following the examination, and such record shall thereafter be maintained or destroyed as provided in chapters 119 and 257. This subsection does not apply to national examinations approved and administered pursuant to this section. (4) Meetings of any member of the department or of any board within the department held for the exclusive purpose of creating or reviewing licensure examination questions or proposed examination questions are exempt from the provisions of s. 286.011 and s. 24(b), Art. I of the State Constitution. Any public records, such as tape recordings, minutes, or notes, generated during or as a result of such meetings are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. However, these exemptions shall not affect the right of any person to review an examination as provided in subsection (2). (5) For examinations developed by the department or a contracted vendor, each board, or the department when there is no board, may provide licensure examinations in an applicant’s native language. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, applicants for examination or reexamination pursuant to this subsection shall bear the full cost for the department’s development, preparation, validation, administration, grading, and evaluation of any examination in a language other than English prior to the examination being administered. Requests for translated examinations must be on file in the board office at least 6 months prior to the scheduled examination. When determining whether it is in the public interest to allow the examination to be translated into a language other than English, the board shall consider the percentage of the population who speak the applicant’s native language. Applicants must apply for translation to the applicable board at least 6 months prior to the scheduled examination. (6) In addition to meeting any other requirements for licensure by examination or by endorsement, and notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (1)(c), an applicant may be required by a board, or the department when there is no board, to certify competency in state laws and rules relating to the applicable practice act. All laws and rules examinations shall be administered electronically unless the laws and rules examination is administered concurrently with another written examination for that profession or unless the electronic administration would be substantially more expensive. (7) The department may post examination scores electronically on the Internet in lieu of mailing the scores to each applicant. The electronic posting of the examination scores meets the requirements of chapter 120 if the department also posts along with the examination scores a notification of the rights set forth in chapter 120. The date of receipt for purposes of chapter 120 is the date the examination scores are posted electronically. The department shall also notify the applicant when scores are posted electronically of the availability of postexamination review, if applicable.

The department shall include, with respect to practitioners licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459, information relating to liability actions which has been reported under ss. 456.049 and 627.912 within the previous 10 years for any paid claim that exceeds $100,000. Such claims information shall be reported in the context of comparing an individual practitioner’s claims to the experience of other practitioners within the same specialty, or profession if the practitioner is not a specialist. The department must provide a hyperlink in such practitioner’s profile to all such comparison reports. If information relating to a liability action is included in a practitioner’s practitioner profile, the profile must also include the following statement: “Settlement of a claim may occur for a variety of reasons that do not necessarily reflect negatively on the professional competence or conduct of the practitioner. A payment in settlement of a medical malpractice action or claim should not be construed as creating a presumption that medical malpractice has occurred.” (5) The Department of Health shall include the date of a hospital or ambulatory surgical center disciplinary action taken by a licensed hospital or an ambulatory surgical center, in accordance with the requirements of s. 395.0193, in the practitioner profile. The department shall state whether the action related to professional competence and whether it related to the delivery of services to a patient. (6) The Department of Health shall provide in each practitioner profile for every physician or advanced practice registered nurse terminated for cause from participating in the Medicaid program, pursuant to s. 409.913, or sanctioned by the Medicaid program a statement that the practitioner has been terminated from participating in the Florida Medicaid program or sanctioned by the Medicaid program. (7) The Department of Health may include in the practitioner’s practitioner profile any other information that is a public record of any governmental entity and that relates to a practitioner’s ability to competently practice his or her profession. (8) Upon the completion of a practitioner profile under this section, the Department of Health shall furnish the practitioner who is the subject of the profile a copy of it for review and verification. The practitioner has a period of 30 days in which to review and verify the contents of the profile and to correct any factual inaccuracies in it. The Department of Health shall make the profile available to the public at the end of the 30-day period regardless of whether the practitioner has provided verification of the profile content. A practitioner shall be subject to a fine of up to $100 per day for failure to verify the profile contents and to correct any factual errors in his or her profile within the 30-day period. The department shall make the profiles available to the public through the World Wide Web and other commonly used means of distribution. The department must include the following statement, in boldface type, in each profile that has not been reviewed by the practitioner to which it applies: “The practitioner has not verified the information contained in this profile.” (9) The Department of Health must provide in each profile an easy-to-read explanation of any disciplinary action taken and the reason the sanction or sanctions were imposed. (10) The Department of Health may provide one link in each profile to a practitioner’s professional website if the practitioner requests that such a link be included in his or her profile. (11) Making a practitioner profile available to the public under this section does not constitute agency action for which a hearing under s. 120.57 may be sought.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or s. 90.503, when: (1) A patient is engaged in a treatment relationship with a psychiatrist; (2) Such patient has communicated to the psychiatrist a specific threat to cause serious bodily injury or death to an identified or a readily available person; and (3) The treating psychiatrist makes a clinical judgment that the patient has the apparent intent and ability to imminently or immediately carry out such threat, the psychiatrist may disclose patient communications to the extent necessary to warn any potential victim and must disclose patient communications to the extent necessary to communicate the threat to a law enforcement agency. A law enforcement agency that receives notification of a specific threat under this section must take appropriate action to prevent the risk of harm, including, but not limited to, notifying the intended victim of such threat or initiating a risk protection order.

(f) Having a license or the authority to practice any regulated profession revoked, suspended, or otherwise acted against, including the denial of licensure, by the licensing authority of any jurisdiction, including its agencies or subdivisions, for a violation that would constitute a violation under Florida law. The licensing authority’s acceptance of a relinquishment of licensure, stipulation, consent order, or other settlement, offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of charges against the license, shall be construed as action against the license. (g) Having been found liable in a civil proceeding for knowingly filing a false report or complaint with the department against another licensee. (h) Attempting to obtain, obtaining, or renewing a license to practice a profession by bribery, by fraudulent misrepresentation, or through an error of the department or the board.

(j) Aiding, assisting, procuring, employing, or advising any unlicensed person or entity to practice a profession contrary to this chapter, the chapter regulating the profession, or the rules of the department or the board. (k) Failing to perform any statutory or legal obligation placed upon a licensee.

Fines collected shall be deposited into the Medical Quality Assurance Trust Fund. (l) Making or filing a report which the licensee knows to be false, intentionally or negligently failing to file a report or record required by state or federal law, or willfully impeding or obstructing another person to do so.

(y) Using information about people involved in motor vehicle accidents which has been derived from accident reports made by law enforcement officers or persons involved in accidents under s. 316.066, or using information published in a newspaper or other news publication or through a radio or television broadcast that has used information gained from such reports, for the purposes of commercial or any other solicitation whatsoever of the people involved in the accidents. (z) Being unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reason of illness or use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any other type of material or as a result of any mental or physical condition. In enforcing this paragraph, the department shall have, upon a finding of the State Surgeon General or the State Surgeon General’s designee that probable cause exists to believe that the licensee is unable to practice because of the reasons stated in this paragraph, the authority to issue an order to compel a licensee to submit to a mental or physical examination by physicians designated by the department. If the licensee refuses to comply with the order, the department’s order directing the examination may be enforced by filing a petition for enforcement in the circuit court where the licensee resides or does business. The department shall be entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011. A licensee or certificateholder affected under this paragraph shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that he or she can resume the competent practice of his or her profession with reasonable skill and safety to patients.

(dd) Violating any provision of this chapter, the applicable practice act, or any rules adopted pursuant thereto. (ee) With respect to making a personal injury protection claim as required by s. 627.736, intentionally submitting a claim, statement, or bill that has been “upcoded” as defined in s. 627.732. (ff) With respect to making a personal injury protection claim as required by s. 627.736, intentionally submitting a claim, statement, or bill for payment of services that were not rendered. (gg) Engaging in a pattern of practice when prescribing medicinal drugs or controlled substances which demonstrates a lack of reasonable skill or safety to patients, a violation of this chapter or ss. 893.055 and 893.0551, a violation of the applicable practice act, or a violation of any rules adopted under this chapter or the applicable practice act of the prescribing practitioner. Notwithstanding s. 456.073(13), the department may initiate an investigation and establish such a pattern from billing records, data, or any other information obtained by the department. (hh) Being terminated from an impaired practitioner program that is overseen by a consultant as described in s. 456.076, for failure to comply, without good cause, with the terms of the monitoring or participant contract entered into by the licensee, or for not successfully completing any drug treatment or alcohol treatment program.

(ss) Being convicted or found guilty of; entering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication; or committing or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit an act that would constitute a violation of any of the offenses listed in s. 456.074(5) or a similar offense in another jurisdiction. (tt) Failure to comply with s. 456.0625, relating to refunding overpayments to patients. (2) When the board, or the department when there is no board, finds any person guilty of the grounds set forth in subsection (1) or of any grounds set forth in the applicable practice act, including conduct constituting a substantial violation of subsection (1) or a violation of the applicable practice act which occurred prior to obtaining a license, it may enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: (a) Refusal to certify, or to certify with restrictions, an application for a license. (b) Suspension or permanent revocation of a license. (c) Restriction of practice or license, including, but not limited to, restricting the licensee from practicing in certain settings, restricting the licensee to work only under designated conditions or in certain settings, restricting the licensee from performing or providing designated clinical and administrative services, restricting the licensee from practicing more than a designated number of hours, or any other restriction found to be necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. (d) Imposition of an administrative fine not to exceed $10,000 for each count or separate offense. If the violation is for fraud or making a false or fraudulent representation, the board, or the department if there is no board, must impose a fine of $10,000 per count or offense. (e) Issuance of a reprimand or letter of concern. (f) Placement of the licensee on probation for a period of time and subject to such conditions as the board, or the department when there is no board, may specify. Those conditions may include, but are not limited to, requiring the licensee to undergo treatment, attend continuing education courses, submit to be reexamined, work under the supervision of another licensee, or satisfy any terms which are reasonably tailored to the violations found. (g) Corrective action. (h) Imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with s. 381.0261 for violations regarding patient rights. (i) Refund of fees billed and collected from the patient or a third party on behalf of the patient. (j) Requirement that the practitioner undergo remedial education. In determining what action is appropriate, the board, or department when there is no board, must first consider what sanctions are necessary to protect the public or to compensate the patient. Only after those sanctions have been imposed may the disciplining authority consider and include in the order requirements designed to rehabilitate the practitioner. All costs associated with compliance with orders issued under this subsection are the obligation of the practitioner. (3)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (2), if the ground for disciplinary action is the first-time failure of the licensee to satisfy continuing education requirements established by the board, or by the department if there is no board, the board or department, as applicable, shall issue a citation in accordance with s. 456.077 and assess a fine, as determined by the board or department by rule. In addition, for each hour of continuing education not completed or completed late, the board or department, as applicable, may require the licensee to take 1 additional hour of continuing education for each hour not completed or completed late. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (2), if the ground for disciplinary action is the first-time violation of a practice act for unprofessional conduct, as used in ss. 464.018(1)(h), 467.203(1)(f), 468.365(1)(f), and 478.52(1)(f), and no actual harm to the patient occurred, the board or department, as applicable, shall issue a citation in accordance with s. 456.077 and assess a penalty as determined by rule of the board or department. (4) In addition to any other discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, under this section or discipline imposed through final order, or citation, entered on or after July 1, 2001, for a violation of any practice act, the board, or the department when there is no board, shall assess costs related to the investigation and prosecution of the case. The costs related to the investigation and prosecution include, but are not limited to, salaries and benefits of personnel, costs related to the time spent by the attorney and other personnel working on the case, and any other expenses incurred by the department for the case. The board, or the department when there is no board, shall determine the amount of costs to be assessed after its consideration of an affidavit of itemized costs and any written objections thereto. In any case where the board or the department imposes a fine or assessment and the fine or assessment is not paid within a reasonable time, the reasonable time to be prescribed in the rules of the board, or the department when there is no board, or in the order assessing the fines or costs, the department or the Department of Legal Affairs may contract for the collection of, or bring a civil action to recover, the fine or assessment. (5) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other remedy or criminal prosecution, the department may file a proceeding in the name of the state seeking issuance of an injunction or a writ of mandamus against any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter, or any provision of law with respect to professions regulated by the department, or any board therein, or the rules adopted pursuant thereto. (6) If the board, or the department when there is no board, determines that revocation of a license is the appropriate penalty, the revocation shall be permanent. However, the board may establish by rule requirements for reapplication by applicants whose licenses have been permanently revoked. The requirements may include, but are not limited to, satisfying current requirements for an initial license. (7) Notwithstanding subsection (2), upon a finding that a physician has prescribed or dispensed a controlled substance, or caused a controlled substance to be prescribed or dispensed, in a manner that violates the standard of practice set forth in s. 458.331(1)(q) or (t), s. 459.015(1)(t) or (x), s. 461.013(1)(o) or (s), or s. 466.028(1)(p) or (x), or that an advanced practice registered nurse has prescribed or dispensed a controlled substance, or caused a controlled substance to be prescribed or dispensed, in a manner that violates the standard of practice set forth in s. 464.018(1)(n) or (p)6., the physician or advanced practice registered nurse shall be suspended for a period of not less than 6 months and pay a fine of not less than $10,000 per count. Repeated violations shall result in increased penalties. (8) The purpose of this section is to facilitate uniform discipline for those actions made punishable under this section and, to this end, a reference to this section constitutes a general reference under the doctrine of incorporation by reference.

      "heading": "Disciplinary proceedings.",
      "text": "456.073 Disciplinary proceedings.—Disciplinary proceedings for each board shall be within the jurisdiction of the department. (1) The department, for the boards under its jurisdiction, shall cause to be investigated any complaint that is filed before it if the complaint is in writing, signed by the complainant, and legally sufficient. A complaint filed by a state prisoner against a health care practitioner employed by or otherwise providing health care services within a facility of the Department of Corrections is not legally sufficient unless there is a showing that the prisoner complainant has exhausted all available administrative remedies within the state correctional system before filing the complaint. However, if the Department of Health determines after a preliminary inquiry of a state prisoner’s complaint that the practitioner may present a serious threat to the health and safety of any individual who is not a state prisoner, the Department of Health may determine legal sufficiency and proceed with discipline. The Department of Health shall be notified within 15 days after the Department of Corrections disciplines or allows a health care practitioner to resign for an offense related to the practice of his or her profession. A complaint is legally sufficient if it contains ultimate facts that show that a violation of this chapter, of any of the practice acts relating to the professions regulated by the department, or of any rule adopted by the department or a regulatory board in the department has occurred. In order to determine legal sufficiency, the department may require supporting information or documentation. The department may investigate, and the department or the appropriate board may take appropriate final action on, a complaint even though the original complainant withdraws it or otherwise indicates a desire not to cause the complaint to be investigated or prosecuted to completion. The department may investigate an anonymous complaint if the complaint is in writing and is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rules is substantial, and if the department has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the violations alleged in the complaint are true. The department may investigate a complaint made by a confidential informant if the complaint is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rule is substantial, and if the department has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the allegations of the complainant are true. The department may initiate an investigation if it has reasonable cause to believe that a licensee or a group of licensees has violated a Florida statute, a rule of the department, or a rule of a board. Notwithstanding subsection (13), the department may investigate information filed pursuant to s. 456.041(4) relating to liability actions with respect to practitioners licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 which have been reported under s. 456.049 or s. 627.912 within the previous 6 years for any paid claim that exceeds $50,000. Except as provided in ss. 458.331(9), 459.015(9), 460.413(5), and 461.013(6), when an investigation of any subject is undertaken, the department shall promptly furnish to the subject or the subject’s attorney a copy of the complaint or document that resulted in the initiation of the investigation. The subject may submit a written response to the information contained in such complaint or document within 20 days after service to the subject of the complaint or document. The subject’s written response shall be considered by the probable cause panel. The right to respond does not prohibit the issuance of a summary emergency order if necessary to protect the public. However, if the State Surgeon General, or the State Surgeon General’s designee, and the chair of the respective board or the chair of its probable cause panel agree in writing that such notification would be detrimental to the investigation, the department may withhold notification. The department may conduct an investigation without notification to any subject if the act under investigation is a criminal offense. (2) The department shall allocate sufficient and adequately trained staff to expeditiously and thoroughly determine legal sufficiency and investigate all legally sufficient complaints. For purposes of this section, it is the intent of the Legislature that the term “expeditiously” means that the department complete the report of its initial investigative findings and recommendations concerning the existence of probable cause within 6 months after its receipt of the complaint. The failure of the department, for disciplinary cases under its jurisdiction, to comply with the time limits of this section while investigating a complaint against a licensee constitutes harmless error in any subsequent disciplinary action unless a court finds that either the fairness of the proceeding or the correctness of the action may have been impaired by a material error in procedure or a failure to follow prescribed procedure. When its investigation is complete and legally sufficient, the department shall prepare and submit to the probable cause panel of the appropriate regulatory board the investigative report of the department. The report shall contain the investigative findings and the recommendations of the department concerning the existence of probable cause. The department shall not recommend a letter of guidance in lieu of finding probable cause if the subject has already been issued a letter of guidance for a related offense. At any time after legal sufficiency is found, the department may dismiss any case, or any part thereof, if the department determines that there is insufficient evidence to support the prosecution of allegations contained therein. The department shall provide a detailed report to the appropriate probable cause panel prior to dismissal of any case or part thereof, and to the subject of the complaint after dismissal of any case or part thereof, under this section. For cases dismissed prior to a finding of probable cause, such report is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). The probable cause panel shall have access, upon request, to the investigative files pertaining to a case prior to dismissal of such case. If the department dismisses a case, the probable cause panel may retain independent legal counsel, employ investigators, and continue the investigation and prosecution of the case as it deems necessary. (3) As an alternative to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2), when a complaint is received, the department may provide a licensee with a notice of noncompliance for an initial offense of a minor violation. Each board, or the department if there is no board, shall establish by rule those minor violations under this provision which do not endanger the public health, safety, and welfare and which do not demonstrate a serious inability to practice the profession. Failure of a licensee to take action in correcting the violation within 15 days after notice may result in the institution of regular disciplinary proceedings. (4) The determination as to whether probable cause exists shall be made by majority vote of a probable cause panel of the board, or by the department, as appropriate. Each regulatory board shall provide by rule that the determination of probable cause shall be made by a panel of its members or by the department. Each board may provide by rule for multiple probable cause panels composed of at least two members. Each board may provide by rule that one or more members of the panel or panels may be a former board member. The length of term or repetition of service of any such former board member on a probable cause panel may vary according to the direction of the board when authorized by board rule. Any probable cause panel must include one of the board’s former or present consumer members, if one is available, is willing to serve, and is authorized to do so by the board chair. Any probable cause panel must include a present board member. Any probable cause panel must include a former or present professional board member. However, any former professional board member serving on the probable cause panel must hold an active valid license for that profession. All proceedings of the panel are exempt from s. 286.011 until 10 days after probable cause has been found to exist by the panel or until the subject of the investigation waives his or her privilege of confidentiality. The probable cause panel may make a reasonable request, and upon such request the department shall provide such additional investigative information as is necessary to the determination of probable cause. A request for additional investigative information shall be made within 15 days from the date of receipt by the probable cause panel of the investigative report of the department or the agency. The probable cause panel or the department, as may be appropriate, shall make its determination of probable cause within 30 days after receipt by it of the final investigative report of the department. The State Surgeon General may grant extensions of the 15-day and the 30-day time limits. In lieu of a finding of probable cause, the probable cause panel, or the department if there is no board, may issue a letter of guidance to the subject. If, within the 30-day time limit, as may be extended, the probable cause panel does not make a determination regarding the existence of probable cause or does not issue a letter of guidance in lieu of a finding of probable cause, the department must make a determination regarding the existence of probable cause within 10 days after the expiration of the time limit. If the probable cause panel finds that probable cause exists, it shall direct the department to file a formal complaint against the licensee. The department shall follow the directions of the probable cause panel regarding the filing of a formal complaint. If directed to do so, the department shall file a formal complaint against the subject of the investigation and prosecute that complaint pursuant to chapter 120. However, the department may decide not to prosecute the complaint if it finds that probable cause has been improvidently found by the panel. In such cases, the department shall refer the matter to the board. The board may then file a formal complaint and prosecute the complaint pursuant to chapter 120. The department shall also refer to the board any investigation or disciplinary proceeding not before the Division of Administrative Hearings pursuant to chapter 120 or otherwise completed by the department within 1 year after the filing of a complaint. The department, for disciplinary cases under its jurisdiction, must establish a uniform reporting system to quarterly refer to each board the status of any investigation or disciplinary proceeding that is not before the Division of Administrative Hearings or otherwise completed by the department within 1 year after the filing of the complaint. Annually, the department, in consultation with the applicable probable cause panel, must establish a plan to expedite or otherwise close any investigation or disciplinary proceeding that is not before the Division of Administrative Hearings or otherwise completed by the department within 1 year after the filing of the complaint. A probable cause panel or a board may retain independent legal counsel, employ investigators, and continue the investigation as it deems necessary; all costs thereof shall be paid from a trust fund used by the department to implement this chapter. All proceedings of the probable cause panel are exempt from s. 120.525. (5) A formal hearing before an administrative law judge from the Division of Administrative Hearings shall be held pursuant to chapter 120 if there are any disputed issues of material fact. The determination of whether or not a licensee has violated the laws and rules regulating the profession, including a determination of the reasonable standard of care, is a conclusion of law to be determined by the board, or department when there is no board, and is not a finding of fact to be determined by an administrative law judge. The administrative law judge shall issue a recommended order pursuant to chapter 120. Notwithstanding s. 120.569(2), the department shall notify the division within 45 days after receipt of a petition or request for a formal hearing. (6) The appropriate board, with those members of the panel, if any, who reviewed the investigation pursuant to subsection (4) being excused, or the department when there is no board, shall determine and issue the final order in each disciplinary case. Such order shall constitute final agency action. Any consent order or agreed-upon settlement shall be subject to the approval of the department. (7) The department shall have standing to seek judicial review of any final order of the board, pursuant to s. 120.68. (8) Any proceeding for the purpose of summary suspension of a license, or for the restriction of the license, of a licensee pursuant to s. 120.60(6) shall be conducted by the State Surgeon General or his or her designee, as appropriate, who shall issue the final summary order. (9)(a) The department shall periodically notify the person who filed the complaint, as well as the patient or the patient’s legal representative, of the status of the investigation, indicating whether probable cause has been found and the status of any civil action or administrative proceeding or appeal. (b) In any disciplinary case for which probable cause has been found, the department shall provide to the person who filed the complaint a copy of the administrative complaint and: 1. A written explanation of how an administrative complaint is resolved by the disciplinary process. 2. A written explanation of how and when the person may participate in the disciplinary process. 3. A written notice of any hearing before the Division of Administrative Hearings or the regulatory board at which final agency action may be taken. (c) In any disciplinary case for which probable cause is not found, the department shall so inform the person who filed the complaint and notify that person that he or she may, within 60 days, provide any additional information to the department which may be relevant to the decision. To facilitate the provision of additional information, the person who filed the complaint may receive, upon request, a copy of the department’s expert report that supported the recommendation for closure, if such a report was relied upon by the department. In no way does this require the department to procure an expert opinion or report if none was used. Additionally, the identity of the expert shall remain confidential. In any administrative proceeding under s. 120.57, the person who filed the disciplinary complaint shall have the right to present oral or written communication relating to the alleged disciplinary violations or to the appropriate penalty. (10)(a) The complaint and all information obtained pursuant to the investigation by the department are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) until 10 days after probable cause has been found to exist by the probable cause panel or by the department, or until the regulated professional or subject of the investigation waives his or her privilege of confidentiality, whichever occurs first. (b) The department shall report any significant investigation information relating to a nurse holding a multistate license to the coordinated licensure information system pursuant to s. 464.0095; any investigative information relating to an audiologist or a speech-language pathologist holding a compact privilege under the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 468.1335; any investigative information relating to a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant holding a compact privilege under the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 486.112; any significant investigatory information relating to a psychologist practicing under the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact to the coordinated licensure information system pursuant to s. 490.0075; and any significant investigatory information relating to a health care practitioner practicing under the Professional Counselors Licensure Compact to the data system pursuant to s. 491.017. (c) Upon completion of the investigation and a recommendation by the department to find probable cause, and pursuant to a written request by the subject or the subject’s attorney, the department shall provide the subject an opportunity to inspect the investigative file or, at the subject’s expense, forward to the subject a copy of the investigative file. Notwithstanding s. 456.057, the subject may inspect or receive a copy of any expert witness report or patient record connected with the investigation if the subject agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality of any information received under this subsection until 10 days after probable cause is found and to maintain the confidentiality of patient records pursuant to s. 456.057. The subject may file a written response to the information contained in the investigative file. Such response must be filed within 20 days of mailing by the department, unless an extension of time has been granted by the department. (d) This subsection does not prohibit the department from providing the complaint and any information obtained pursuant to the department’s investigation to any law enforcement agency or to any other regulatory agency. (11) A privilege against civil liability is hereby granted to any complainant or any witness with regard to information furnished with respect to any investigation or proceeding pursuant to this section, unless the complainant or witness acted in bad faith or with malice in providing such information. (12)(a) No person who reports in any capacity, whether or not required by law, information to the department with regard to the incompetence, impairment, or unprofessional conduct of any health care provider licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, chapter 462, chapter 463, chapter 464, chapter 465, or chapter 466 shall be held liable in any civil action for reporting against such health care provider if such person acts without intentional fraud or malice. (b) No facility licensed under chapter 395, health maintenance organization certificated under part I of chapter 641, physician licensed under chapter 458, or osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 459 shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee or staff member by reason of such employee’s or staff member’s report to the department about a physician licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, or chapter 466 who may be guilty of incompetence, impairment, or unprofessional conduct so long as such report is given without intentional fraud or malice. (c) In any civil suit brought outside the protections of paragraphs (a) and (b) in which intentional fraud or malice is alleged, the person alleging intentional fraud or malice shall be liable for all court costs and for the other party’s reasonable attorney’s fees if intentional fraud or malice is not proved. (13) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an administrative complaint against a licensee shall be filed within 6 years after the time of the incident or occurrence giving rise to the complaint against the licensee. If such incident or occurrence involved criminal actions, diversion of controlled substances, sexual misconduct, or impairment by the licensee, this subsection does not apply to bar initiation of an investigation or filing of an administrative complaint beyond the 6-year timeframe. In those cases covered by this subsection in which it can be shown that fraud, concealment, or intentional misrepresentation of fact prevented the discovery of the violation of law, the period of limitations is extended forward, but in no event to exceed 12 years after the time of the incident or occurrence.

      "text": "456.076 Impaired practitioner programs.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Consultant” means the individual or entity who operates an approved impaired practitioner program pursuant to a contract with the department and who is retained by the department as provided in subsection (2). (b) “Evaluator” means a state-licensed or nationally certified individual who has been approved by a consultant or the department, who has completed an evaluator training program established by the consultant, and who is therefore authorized to evaluate practitioners as part of an impaired practitioner program. (c) “Impaired practitioner” means a practitioner with an impairment. (d) “Impaired practitioner program” means a program established by the department by contract with one or more consultants to serve impaired and potentially impaired practitioners for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public. (e) “Impairment” means a potentially impairing health condition that is the result of the misuse or abuse of alcohol, drugs, or both, or a mental or physical condition that could affect a practitioner’s ability to practice with skill and safety. (f) “Inability to progress” means a determination by a consultant based on a participant’s response to treatment and prognosis that the participant is unable to safely practice despite compliance with treatment requirements and his or her participant contract. (g) “Material noncompliance” means an act or omission by a participant in violation of his or her participant contract as determined by the department or consultant. (h) “Participant” means a practitioner who is participating in the impaired practitioner program by having entered into a participant contract. A practitioner ceases to be a participant when the participant contract is successfully completed or is terminated for any reason. (i) “Participant contract” means a formal written document outlining the requirements established by a consultant for a participant to successfully complete the impaired practitioner program, including the participant’s monitoring plan. (j) “Practitioner” means a person licensed, registered, certified, or regulated by the department under part III of chapter 401; chapter 457; chapter 458; chapter 459; chapter 460; chapter 461; chapter 462; chapter 463; chapter 464; chapter 465; chapter 466; chapter 467; part I, part II, part III, part V, part X, part XIII, or part XIV of chapter 468; chapter 478; chapter 480; part I or part II of chapter 483; chapter 484; chapter 486; chapter 490; or chapter 491; or an applicant for a license, registration, or certification under the same laws. (k) “Referral” means a practitioner who has been referred, either as a self-referral or otherwise, or reported to a consultant for impaired practitioner program services, but who is not under a participant contract. (l) “Treatment program” means a department-approved or consultant-approved residential, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, or other program through which an impaired practitioner is treated based on the impaired practitioner’s diagnosis and the treatment plan approved by the consultant. (m) “Treatment provider” means a department-approved or consultant-approved residential state-licensed or nationally certified individual who provides treatment to an impaired practitioner based on the practitioner’s individual diagnosis and a treatment plan approved by the consultant. (2) The department may retain one or more consultants to operate its impaired practitioner program. Each consultant must be: (a) A practitioner licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, or part I of chapter 464; or (b) An entity that employs: 1. A medical director who is licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459; or 2. An executive director who is licensed under part I of chapter 464. (3) The terms and conditions of the impaired practitioner program must be established by the department by contract with a consultant for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public and must provide, at a minimum, that the consultant: (a) Accepts referrals; (b) Arranges for the evaluation and treatment of impaired practitioners by a treatment provider when the consultant deems such evaluation and treatment necessary; (c) Monitors the recovery progress and status of impaired practitioners to ensure that such practitioners are able to practice their profession with skill and safety. Such monitoring must continue until the consultant or department concludes that monitoring by the consultant is no longer required for the protection of the public or until the practitioner’s participation in the program is terminated for material noncompliance or inability to progress; and (d) Does not directly evaluate, treat, or otherwise provide patient care to a practitioner in the operation of the impaired practitioner program. (4) The department shall specify, in its contract with each consultant, the types of licenses, registrations, or certifications of the practitioners to be served by that consultant. (5) A consultant shall enter into a participant contract with an impaired practitioner and shall establish the terms of monitoring and shall include the terms in a participant contract. In establishing the terms of monitoring, the consultant may consider the recommendations of one or more approved evaluators, treatment programs, or treatment providers. A consultant may modify the terms of monitoring if the consultant concludes, through the course of monitoring, that extended, additional, or amended terms of monitoring are required for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public. If the impaired practitioner is an audiologist or a speech-language pathologist practicing under the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate Compact pursuant to s. 468.1335, a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant practicing under the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact pursuant to s. 486.112, a psychologist practicing under the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact pursuant to s. 490.0075, or a health care practitioner practicing under the Professional Counselors Licensure Compact pursuant to s. 491.017, the terms of the monitoring contract must include the impaired practitioner’s withdrawal from all practice under the compact unless authorized by a member state. (6) A consultant is not required to be licensed as a substance abuse provider or mental health treatment provider under chapter 394, chapter 395, or chapter 397 for purposes of providing services under this program. (7) Each consultant shall assist the department and licensure boards on matters of impaired practitioners, including the determination of whether a practitioner is, in fact, impaired, as specified in the consultant’s contract with the department. (8) Before issuing an approval of, or intent to deny, an application for licensure, each board and profession within the Division of Medical Quality Assurance may delegate to its chair or other designee its authority to determine that an applicant for licensure under its jurisdiction may have an impairment. Upon such determination, the chair or other designee may refer the applicant to the consultant to facilitate an evaluation before the board issues an approval of, or intent to deny, his or her application. If the applicant agrees to be evaluated, the department’s deadline for approving or denying the application pursuant to s. 120.60(1) is tolled until the evaluation is completed and the result of the evaluation and recommendation is communicated to the board by the consultant. If the applicant declines to be evaluated, the board shall issue an approval of, or intent to deny, the applicant’s application notwithstanding the lack of an evaluation and recommendation by the consultant. (9)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), when the department receives a legally sufficient complaint alleging that a practitioner has an impairment and no complaint exists against the practitioner other than impairment, the department shall refer the practitioner to the consultant, along with all information in the department’s possession relating to the impairment. The impairment does not constitute grounds for discipline pursuant to s. 456.072 or the applicable practice act if: 1. The practitioner has acknowledged the impairment; 2. The practitioner becomes a participant in an impaired practitioner program and successfully completes a participant contract under terms established by the consultant; 3. The practitioner has voluntarily withdrawn from practice or has limited the scope of his or her practice if required by the consultant; 4. The practitioner has provided to the consultant, or has authorized the consultant to obtain, all records and information relating to the impairment from any source and all other medical records of the practitioner requested by the consultant; and 5. The practitioner has authorized the consultant, in the event of the practitioner’s termination from the impaired practitioner program, to report the termination to the department and provide the department with copies of all information in the consultant’s possession relating to the practitioner. (b) For a practitioner employed by a governmental entity who is also certified by the department pursuant to part III of chapter 401, the department may not refer the practitioner to the consultant, as described in paragraph (a), when the practitioner has already been referred by his or her employer to an employee assistance program used by the governmental entity. If the practitioner fails to satisfactorily complete the employee assistance program or his or her employment is terminated, the employer shall immediately notify the department, which shall then refer the practitioner to the consultant as provided in paragraph (a). (10) To encourage practitioners who are or may be impaired to voluntarily self-refer to a consultant, the consultant may not provide information to the department relating to a self-referring participant if the consultant has no knowledge of a pending department investigation, complaint, or disciplinary action against the participant and if the participant is in compliance and making progress with the terms of the impaired practitioner program and contract, unless authorized by the participant. (11) In any disciplinary action for a violation other than impairment in which a practitioner establishes the violation for which the practitioner is being prosecuted was due to or connected with impairment and further establishes the practitioner is satisfactorily progressing through or has successfully completed an impaired practitioner program pursuant to this section, such information may be considered by the board, or the department when there is no board, as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate penalty. This subsection does not limit mitigating factors the board may consider. (12)(a) Upon request by the consultant, and with the authorization of the practitioner when required by law, an approved evaluator, treatment program, or treatment provider shall disclose to the consultant all information in its possession regarding a referral or participant. Failure to provide such information to the consultant is grounds for withdrawal of approval of such evaluator, treatment program, or treatment provider. (b) When a referral or participant is terminated from the impaired practitioner program for material noncompliance with a participant contract, inability to progress, or any other reason than completion of the program, the consultant shall disclose all information in the consultant’s possession relating to the practitioner to the department. Such disclosure shall constitute a complaint pursuant to the general provisions of s. 456.073. In addition, whenever the consultant concludes that impairment affects a practitioner’s practice and constitutes an immediate, serious danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the consultant shall immediately communicate such conclusion to the department and disclose all information in the consultant’s possession relating to the practitioner to the department. (13) All information obtained by the consultant pursuant to this section is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. (14) The provisions of s. 766.101 apply to any consultant and the consultant’s directors, officers, employees, or agents in regard to providing information relating to a participant to a medical review committee if the participant authorizes such disclosure. (15)(a) A consultant retained pursuant to this section and a consultant’s directors, officers, employees, or agents shall be considered agents of the department for purposes of s. 768.28 while acting within the scope of the consultant’s duties under the contract with the department. (b) In accordance with s. 284.385, the Department of Financial Services shall defend any claim, suit, action, or proceeding, including a claim, suit, action, or proceeding for injunctive, affirmative, or declaratory relief, against the consultant, or the consultant’s directors, officers, employees, and agents, brought as the result of any action or omission relating to the impaired practitioner program. (16) If a consultant retained by the department pursuant to this section is also retained by another state agency to operate an impaired practitioner program for that agency, this section also applies to the consultant’s operation of an impaired practitioner program for that agency. (17) A consultant may disclose to a referral or participant, or to the legal representative of the referral or participant, the documents, records, or other information from the consultant’s file, including information received by the consultant from other sources; information on the terms required for the referral’s or participant’s monitoring contract, the referral’s or participant’s progress or inability to progress, or the referral’s or participant’s discharge or termination; information supporting the conclusion of material noncompliance; or any other information required by law. The consultant must disclose to the department, upon the department’s request, whether an applicant for a multistate license under s. 464.0095 is participating in a treatment program and must report to the department when a nurse holding a multistate license under s. 464.0095 enters a treatment program. A nurse holding a multistate license pursuant to s. 464.0095 must report to the department within 2 business days after entering a treatment program pursuant to this section. If a consultant discloses information to the department in accordance with this chapter, a referral or participant, or his or her legal representative, may obtain a complete copy of the consultant’s file from the consultant or the department under s. 456.073. (18)(a) The consultant may contract with a school or program to provide impaired practitioner program services to a student enrolled for the purpose of preparing for licensure as a health care practitioner as defined in this chapter or as a veterinarian under chapter 474 if the student has or is suspected of having an impairment. The department is not responsible for paying for the care provided by approved treatment providers or approved treatment programs or for the services provided by a consultant to a student. (b) A medical school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, or another school providing for the education of students enrolled in preparation for licensure as a health care practitioner as defined in this chapter, or a veterinarian under chapter 474, which is governed by accreditation standards requiring notice and the provision of due process procedures to students, is not liable in any civil action for referring a student to the consultant retained by the department or for disciplinary actions that adversely affect the status of a student when the disciplinary actions are instituted in reasonable reliance on the recommendations, reports, or conclusions provided by such consultant, if the school, in referring the student or taking disciplinary action, adheres to the due process procedures adopted by the applicable accreditation entities and if the school committed no intentional fraud in carrying out the provisions of this section.

The citation shall be issued to the subject and shall contain the subject’s name and address, the subject’s license number if applicable, a brief factual statement, the sections of the law allegedly violated, and the penalty imposed. The citation must clearly state that the subject may choose, in lieu of accepting the citation, to follow the procedure under s. 456.073. If the subject disputes the matter in the citation, the procedures set forth in s. 456.073 must be followed. However, if the subject does not dispute the matter in the citation with the department within 30 days after the citation is served, the citation becomes a public final order and does not constitute discipline for a first offense, but does constitute discipline for a second or subsequent offense. The penalty shall be a fine or other conditions as established by rule. (2) The board, or the department if there is no board, shall adopt rules designating violations for which a citation may be issued. Such rules shall designate as citation violations those violations for which there is no substantial threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or no violation of standard of care involving injury to a patient. Violations for which a citation may be issued shall include violations of continuing education requirements; failure to timely pay required fees and fines; failure to comply with the requirements of ss. 381.026 and 381.0261 regarding the dissemination of information regarding patient rights; failure to comply with advertising requirements; failure to timely update practitioner profile and credentialing files; failure to display signs, licenses, and permits; failure to have required reference books available; and all other violations that do not pose a direct and serious threat to the health and safety of the patient or involve a violation of standard of care that has resulted in injury to a patient. (3) The department shall be entitled to recover the costs of investigation, in addition to any penalty provided according to board or department rule, as part of the penalty levied pursuant to the citation. (4) A citation must be issued within 6 months after the filing of the complaint that is the basis for the citation. (5) Service of a citation may be made by personal service or certified mail, restricted delivery, to the subject at the subject’s last known address. (6) A board has 6 months in which to enact rules designating violations and penalties appropriate for citation offenses. Failure to enact such rules gives the department exclusive authority to adopt rules as required for implementing this section. A board has continuous authority to amend its rules adopted pursuant to this section. History.—s. 67, ch. 97-261; s. 95, ch. 2000-160; s. 74, ch. 2001-277; s. 21, ch. 2003-416.

(3) After the department determines a complaint is legally sufficient and the alleged violations are defined as mediation offenses, the department or any agent of the department may conduct informal mediation to resolve the complaint. If the complainant and the subject of the complaint agree to a resolution of a complaint within 14 days after contact by the mediator, the mediator shall notify the department of the terms of the resolution. The department or board shall take no further action unless the complainant and the subject each fail to record with the department an acknowledgment of satisfaction of the terms of mediation within 60 days of the mediator’s notification to the department. A successful mediation shall not constitute discipline. In the event the complainant and subject fail to reach settlement terms or to record the required acknowledgment, the department shall process the complaint according to the provisions of s. 456.073. (4) Conduct or statements made during mediation are inadmissible in any proceeding pursuant to s. 456.073. Further, any information relating to the mediation of a case shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of s. 456.073.

It is the intent of the Legislature that citizens be able to choose from all health care options, including the prevailing or conventional treatment methods as well as other treatments designed to complement or substitute for the prevailing or conventional treatment methods. It is the intent of the Legislature that health care practitioners be able to offer complementary or alternative health care treatments with the same requirements, provisions, and liabilities as those associated with the prevailing or conventional treatment methods. (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Complementary or alternative health care treatment” means any treatment that is designed to provide patients with an effective option to the prevailing or conventional treatment methods associated with the services provided by a health care practitioner. Such a treatment may be provided in addition to or in place of other treatment options. (b) “Health care practitioner” means any health care practitioner as defined in s. 456.001(4). (3) COMMUNICATION OF TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES.—A health care practitioner who offers to provide a patient with a complementary or alternative health care treatment must inform the patient of the nature of the treatment and must explain the benefits and risks associated with the treatment to the extent necessary for the patient to make an informed and prudent decision regarding such treatment option. In compliance with this subsection: (a) The health care practitioner must inform the patient of the practitioner’s education, experience, and credentials in relation to the complementary or alternative health care treatment option. (b) The health care practitioner may, in his or her discretion, communicate the information orally or in written form directly to the patient or to the patient’s legal representative. (c) The health care practitioner may, in his or her discretion and without restriction, recommend any mode of treatment that is, in his or her judgment, in the best interests of the patient, including complementary or alternative health care treatments, in accordance with the provisions of his or her license. (4) RECORDS.—Every health care practitioner providing a patient with a complementary or alternative health care treatment must indicate in the patient’s care record the method by which the requirements of subsection (3) were met. (5) EFFECT.—This section does not modify or change the scope of practice of any licensees of the department, nor does it alter in any way the provisions of the individual practice acts for those licensees, which require licensees to practice within their respective standards of care and which prohibit fraud and exploitation of patients.

However, a prescription that is electronically generated and transmitted must contain the name of the prescribing practitioner, the name and strength of the drug prescribed, the quantity of the drug prescribed in numerical format, and the directions for use of the drug and must contain the date and an electronic signature, as defined in s. 668.003(4), by the prescribing practitioner only on the day issued. (2) A written prescription for a controlled substance listed in chapter 893 must have the quantity of the drug prescribed in both textual and numerical formats, must be dated in numerical, month/day/year format, or with the abbreviated month written out, or the month written out in whole, and must be either written on a standardized counterfeit-proof prescription pad produced by a vendor approved by the department or electronically prescribed as that term is used in s. 408.0611. As a condition of being an approved vendor, a prescription pad vendor must submit a monthly report to the department that, at a minimum, documents the number of prescription pads sold and identifies the purchasers. The department may, by rule, require the reporting of additional information. (3) A health care practitioner licensed by law to prescribe a medicinal drug who maintains a system of electronic health records as defined in s. 408.051(2)(c), or who prescribes medicinal drugs as an owner, an employee, or a contractor of a licensed health care facility or practice that maintains such a system and who is prescribing in his or her capacity as such an owner, an employee, or a contractor, may only electronically transmit prescriptions for such drugs. This requirement applies to such a health care practitioner upon renewal of the health care practitioner’s license or by July 1, 2021, whichever is earlier, but does not apply if: (a) The practitioner and the dispenser are the same entity; (b) The prescription cannot be transmitted electronically under the most recently implemented version of the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs SCRIPT Standard; (c) The practitioner has been issued a waiver by the department, not to exceed 1 year in duration, from the requirement to use electronic prescribing due to demonstrated economic hardship, technological limitations that are not reasonably within the control of the practitioner, or another exceptional circumstance demonstrated by the practitioner; (d) The practitioner reasonably determines that it would be impractical for the patient in question to obtain a medicinal drug prescribed by electronic prescription in a timely manner and such delay would adversely impact the patient’s medical condition; (e) The practitioner is prescribing a drug under a research protocol; (f) The prescription is for a drug for which the federal Food and Drug Administration requires the prescription to contain elements that may not be included in electronic prescribing; (g) The prescription is issued to an individual receiving hospice care or who is a resident of a nursing home facility; or (h) The practitioner determines that it is in the best interest of the patient, or the patient determines that it is in his or her own best interest, to compare prescription drug prices among area pharmacies. The practitioner must document such determination in the patient’s medical record. The department, in consultation with the Board of Medicine, the Board of Osteopathic Medicine, the Board of Podiatric Medicine, the Board of Dentistry, the Board of Nursing, and the Board of Optometry, may adopt rules to implement this subsection.

(b) Comply with the requirements of this section and applicable board rules. 1 (3) STANDARDS OF PRACTICE FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC NONMALIGNANT PAIN.—The standards of practice in this section do not supersede the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure. (a) A complete medical history and a physical examination must be conducted before beginning any treatment and must be documented in the medical record. The exact components of the physical examination shall be left to the judgment of the registrant who is expected to perform a physical examination proportionate to the diagnosis that justifies a treatment. The medical record must, at a minimum, document the nature and intensity of the pain, current and past treatments for pain, underlying or coexisting diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on physical and psychological function, a review of previous medical records, previous diagnostic studies, and history of alcohol and substance abuse. The medical record shall also document the presence of one or more recognized medical indications for the use of a controlled substance. Each registrant must develop a written plan for assessing each patient’s risk of aberrant drug-related behavior, which may include patient drug testing. Registrants must assess each patient’s risk for aberrant drug-related behavior and monitor that risk on an ongoing basis in accordance with the plan. (b) Each registrant must develop a written individualized treatment plan for each patient. The treatment plan shall state objectives that will be used to determine treatment success, such as pain relief and improved physical and psychosocial function, and shall indicate if any further diagnostic evaluations or other treatments are planned. After treatment begins, the registrant shall adjust drug therapy to the individual medical needs of each patient. Other treatment modalities, including a rehabilitation program, shall be considered depending on the etiology of the pain and the extent to which the pain is associated with physical and psychosocial impairment. The interdisciplinary nature of the treatment plan shall be documented. (c) The registrant shall discuss the risks and benefits of the use of controlled substances, including the risks of abuse and addiction, as well as physical dependence and its consequences, with the patient, persons designated by the patient, or the patient’s surrogate or guardian if the patient is incompetent. The registrant shall use a written controlled substance agreement between the registrant and the patient outlining the patient’s responsibilities, including, but not limited to: 1. Number and frequency of controlled substance prescriptions and refills. 2. Patient compliance and reasons for which drug therapy may be discontinued, such as a violation of the agreement. 3. An agreement that controlled substances for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain shall be prescribed by a single treating registrant unless otherwise authorized by the treating registrant and documented in the medical record. (d) The patient shall be seen by the registrant at regular intervals, not to exceed 3 months, to assess the efficacy of treatment, ensure that controlled substance therapy remains indicated, evaluate the patient’s progress toward treatment objectives, consider adverse drug effects, and review the etiology of the pain. Continuation or modification of therapy shall depend on the registrant’s evaluation of the patient’s progress. If treatment goals are not being achieved, despite medication adjustments, the registrant shall reevaluate the appropriateness of continued treatment. The registrant shall monitor patient compliance in medication usage, related treatment plans, controlled substance agreements, and indications of substance abuse or diversion at a minimum of 3-month intervals. (e) The registrant shall refer the patient as necessary for additional evaluation and treatment in order to achieve treatment objectives. Special attention shall be given to those patients who are at risk for misusing their medications and those whose living arrangements pose a risk for medication misuse or diversion. The management of pain in patients with a history of substance abuse or with a comorbid psychiatric disorder requires extra care, monitoring, and documentation and requires consultation with or referral to an addiction medicine specialist or a psychiatrist. (f) A registrant must maintain accurate, current, and complete records that are accessible and readily available for review and comply with the requirements of this section, the applicable practice act, and applicable board rules. The medical records must include, but are not limited to: 1. The complete medical history and a physical examination, including history of drug abuse or dependence. 2. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and laboratory results. 3. Evaluations and consultations. 4. Treatment objectives. 5. Discussion of risks and benefits. 6. Treatments. 7. Medications, including date, type, dosage, and quantity prescribed. 8. Instructions and agreements. 9. Periodic reviews. 10. Results of any drug testing. 11. A photocopy of the patient’s government-issued photo identification. 12. If a written prescription for a controlled substance is given to the patient, a duplicate of the prescription. 13. The registrant’s full name presented in a legible manner. (g) A registrant shall immediately refer patients with signs or symptoms of substance abuse to a board-certified pain management physician, an addiction medicine specialist, or a mental health addiction facility as it pertains to drug abuse or addiction unless the registrant is a physician who is board-certified or board-eligible in pain management. Throughout the period of time before receiving the consultant’s report, a prescribing registrant shall clearly and completely document medical justification for continued treatment with controlled substances and those steps taken to ensure medically appropriate use of controlled substances by the patient. Upon receipt of the consultant’s written report, the prescribing registrant shall incorporate the consultant’s recommendations for continuing, modifying, or discontinuing controlled substance therapy. The resulting changes in treatment shall be specifically documented in the patient’s medical record. Evidence or behavioral indications of diversion shall be followed by discontinuation of controlled substance therapy, and the patient shall be discharged, and all results of testing and actions taken by the registrant shall be documented in the patient’s medical record. This subsection does not apply to a board-eligible or board-certified anesthesiologist, physiatrist, rheumatologist, or neurologist, or to a board-certified physician who has surgical privileges at a hospital or ambulatory surgery center and primarily provides surgical services. This subsection does not apply to a board-eligible or board-certified medical specialist who has also completed a fellowship in pain medicine approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association, or who is board eligible or board certified in pain medicine by the American Board of Pain Medicine, the American Board of Interventional Pain Physicians, the American Board of Physician Specialties, or a board approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association and performs interventional pain procedures of the type routinely billed using surgical codes. This subsection does not apply to a registrant who prescribes medically necessary controlled substances for a patient during an inpatient stay in a hospital licensed under chapter 395. (4) STANDARDS OF PRACTICE FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE PAIN.—The applicable boards shall adopt rules establishing guidelines for prescribing controlled substances for acute pain, including evaluation of the patient, creation and maintenance of a treatment plan, obtaining informed consent and agreement for treatment, periodic review of the treatment plan, consultation, medical record review, and compliance with controlled substance laws and regulations. Failure of a prescriber to follow such guidelines constitutes grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to s. 456.072(1)(gg), punishable as provided in s. 456.072(2). (5) PRESCRIPTION SUPPLY.— (a) For the treatment of acute pain, a prescription for an opioid drug listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812 may not exceed a 3-day supply, except that up to a 7-day supply may be prescribed if: 1. The prescriber, in his or her professional judgment, believes that more than a 3-day supply of such an opioid is medically necessary to treat the patient’s pain as an acute medical condition; 2. The prescriber indicates “ACUTE PAIN EXCEPTION” on the prescription; and 3. The prescriber adequately documents in the patient’s medical records the acute medical condition and lack of alternative treatment options that justify deviation from the 3-day supply limit established in this subsection. (b) For the treatment of pain other than acute pain, a prescriber must indicate “NONACUTE PAIN” on a prescription for an opioid drug listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812. (6) EMERGENCY OPIOID ANTAGONIST.—For the treatment of pain related to a traumatic injury with an Injury Severity Score of 9 or greater, a prescriber who prescribes a Schedule II controlled substance listed in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812 must concurrently prescribe an emergency opioid antagonist, as defined in s. 381.887(1). (7) NONOPIOID ALTERNATIVES.— (a) The Legislature finds that every competent adult has the fundamental right of self-determination regarding decisions pertaining to his or her own health, including the right to refuse an opioid drug listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812. (b) The department shall develop and publish on its website an educational pamphlet regarding the use of nonopioid alternatives for the treatment of pain. The pamphlet shall, at a minimum, include: 1. Information on available nonopioid alternatives for the treatment of pain, including nonopioid medicinal drugs or drug products and nonpharmacological therapies. 2. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of nonopioid alternatives. (c) Except when a patient is receiving care in a hospital critical care unit or emergency department or a patient is receiving hospice services under s. 400.6095, before providing care requiring the administration of anesthesia involving the use of an opioid drug listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812, or prescribing or ordering an opioid drug listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in s. 893.03 or 21 U.S.C. s. 812 for the treatment of pain, a health care practitioner who prescribes or orders an opioid drug must: 1. Inform the patient or the patient’s representative of available nonopioid alternatives for the treatment of pain, which may include nonopioid medicinal drugs or drug products, interventional procedures or treatments, acupuncture, chiropractic treatments, massage therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or any other appropriate therapy as determined by the health care practitioner. 2. Discuss with the patient or the patient’s representative the advantages and disadvantages of the use of nonopioid alternatives, including whether the patient is at a high risk of, or has a history of, controlled substance abuse or misuse and the patient’s personal preferences. 3. Provide the patient or the patient’s representative, electronically or in printed form, with the educational pamphlet described in paragraph (b). 4.

      "text": "456.4501 Interstate Medical Licensure Compact.—The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: SECTION 1 PURPOSE In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state’s existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter and, therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact. SECTION 2 DEFINITIONS As used in the compact, the term: (1) “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission pursuant to Section 11 for its governance or for directing and controlling its actions and conduct. (2) “Commissioner” means the voting representative appointed by each member board pursuant to Section 11. (3) “Conviction” means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a criminal offense, through adjudication or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender. Evidence of an entry of a conviction of a criminal offense by the court shall be considered final for purposes of disciplinary action by a member board. (4) “Expedited license” means a full and unrestricted medical license granted by a member state to an eligible physician through the process set forth in the compact. (5) “Interstate Commission” means the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission created pursuant to Section 11. (6) “License” means authorization by a state for a physician to engage in the practice of medicine, which would be unlawful without the authorization. (7) “Medical practice act” means laws and regulations governing the practice of allopathic and osteopathic medicine within a member state. (8) “Member board” means a state agency in a member state which acts in the sovereign interests of the state by protecting the public through licensure, regulation, and education of physicians as directed by the state government. (9) “Member state” means a state that has enacted the compact. (10) “Offense” means a felony, high court misdemeanor, or crime of moral turpitude. (11) “Physician” means any person who: (a) Is a graduate of a medical school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, or a medical school listed in the International Medical Education Directory or its equivalent; (b) Passed each component of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA) within three attempts, or any of its predecessor examinations accepted by a state medical board as an equivalent examination for licensure purposes; (c) Successfully completed graduate medical education approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association; (d) Holds specialty certification or a time-unlimited specialty certificate recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association’s Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists; however, the specialty certification or a time-unlimited specialty certificate does not have to be maintained once a physician is initially determined to be eligible for expedited licensure through the compact; (e) Possesses a full and unrestricted license to engage in the practice of medicine issued by a member board; (f) Has never been convicted or received adjudication, deferred adjudication, community supervision, or deferred disposition for any offense by a court of appropriate jurisdiction; (g) Has never held a license authorizing the practice of medicine subjected to discipline by a licensing agency in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, excluding any action related to nonpayment of fees related to a license; (h) Has never had a controlled substance license or permit suspended or revoked by a state or the United States Drug Enforcement Administration; and (i) Is not under active investigation by a licensing agency or law enforcement authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction. (12) “Practice of medicine” means the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, cure, or relieving of a human disease, ailment, defect, complaint, or other physical or mental condition by attendance, advice, device, diagnostic test, or other means, or offering, undertaking, attempting to do, or holding oneself out as able to do any of these acts. (13) “Rule” means a written statement by the Interstate Commission adopted pursuant to Section 12 of the compact which is of general applicability; implements, interprets, or prescribes a policy or provision of the compact or an organizational, procedural, or practice requirement of the Interstate Commission; and has the force and effect of statutory law in a member state, if the rule is not inconsistent with the laws of the member state. The term includes the amendment, repeal, or suspension of an existing rule. (14) “State” means any state, commonwealth, district, or territory of the United States. (15) “State of principal license” means a member state where a physician holds a license to practice medicine and which has been designated as such by the physician for purposes of registration and participation in the compact. SECTION 3 ELIGIBILITY (1) A physician must meet the eligibility requirements as provided in subsection (11) of Section 2 to receive an expedited license under the terms of the compact. (2) A physician who does not meet the requirements specified in subsection (11) of Section 2 may obtain a license to practice medicine in a member state if the individual complies with all laws and requirements, other than the compact, relating to the issuance of a license to practice medicine in that state. SECTION 4 DESIGNATION OF STATE OF PRINCIPAL LICENSE (1) A physician shall designate a member state as the state of principal license for purposes of registration for expedited licensure through the compact if the physician possesses a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in that state and the state is: (a) The state of primary residence for the physician; (b) The state where at least 25 percent of the physician’s practice of medicine occurs; (c) The location of the physician’s employer; or (d) If no state qualifies under paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c), the state designated as the physician’s state of residence for purpose of federal income tax. (2) A physician may redesignate a member state as state of principal license at any time, as long as the state meets one of the descriptions under subsection (1). (3) The Interstate Commission may develop rules to facilitate redesignation of another member state as the state of principal license. SECTION 5 APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE OF EXPEDITED LICENSURE (1) A physician seeking licensure through the compact must file an application for an expedited license with the member board of the state selected by the physician as the state of principal license. (2) Upon receipt of an application for an expedited license, the member board within the state selected as the state of principal license shall evaluate whether the physician is eligible for expedited licensure and issue a letter of qualification, verifying or denying the physician’s eligibility, to the Interstate Commission. (a) Static qualifications, which include verification of medical education, graduate medical education, results of any medical or licensing examination, and other qualifications as determined by the Interstate Commission through rule, are not subject to additional primary source verification if already primary source-verified by the state of principal license. (b) The member board within the state selected as the state of principal license shall, in the course of verifying eligibility, perform a criminal background check of an applicant, including the use of the results of fingerprint or other biometric data checks compliant with the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the exception of federal employees who have a suitability determination in accordance with 5 C.F.R. s. 731.202. (c) Appeal on the determination of eligibility must be made to the member state where the application was filed and is subject to the law of that state. (3) Upon verification in subsection (2), physicians eligible for an expedited license must complete the registration process established by the Interstate Commission to receive a license in a member state selected pursuant to subsection (1). (4) After receiving verification of eligibility under subsection (2) and upon an applicant’s completion of any registration process required under subsection (3), a member board shall issue an expedited license to the physician. This license authorizes the physician to practice medicine in the issuing state consistent with the medical practice act and all applicable laws and regulations of the issuing member board and member state. (5) An expedited license is valid for a period consistent with the licensure period in the member state and in the same manner as required for other physicians holding a full and unrestricted license within the member state. (6) An expedited license obtained through the compact must be terminated if a physician fails to maintain a license in the state of principal license for a nondisciplinary reason, without redesignation of a new state of principal license. (7) The Interstate Commission may develop rules regarding the application process and the issuance of an expedited license. SECTION 6 RENEWAL AND CONTINUED PARTICIPATION (1) A physician seeking to renew an expedited license granted in a member state shall complete a renewal process with the Interstate Commission if the physician: (a) Maintains a full and unrestricted license in a state of principal license; (b) Has not been convicted or received adjudication, deferred adjudication, community supervision, or deferred disposition for any offense by a court of appropriate jurisdiction; (c) Has not had a license authorizing the practice of medicine subject to discipline by a licensing agency in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, excluding any action related to nonpayment of fees related to a license; and (d) Has not had a controlled substance license or permit suspended or revoked by a state or the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. (2) Physicians shall comply with all continuing professional development or continuing medical education requirements for renewal of a license issued by a member state. (3) Physician information collected by the Interstate Commission during the renewal process must be distributed to all member boards. (4) The Interstate Commission may develop rules to address renewal of licenses obtained through the compact. SECTION 7 COORDINATED INFORMATION SYSTEM (1) The Interstate Commission shall establish a database of all physicians licensed, or who have applied for licensure, under Section 5. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, member boards shall report to the Interstate Commission any public action or complaints against a licensed physician who has applied for or received an expedited license through the compact. (3) Member boards shall report to the Interstate Commission disciplinary or investigatory information determined as necessary and proper by rule of the Interstate Commission. (4) Member boards may report to the Interstate Commission any nonpublic complaint, disciplinary, or investigatory information not required by subsection (3). (5) Member boards shall share complaint or disciplinary information about a physician upon request of another member board. (6) All information provided to the Interstate Commission or distributed by member boards shall be confidential, filed under seal, and used only for investigatory or disciplinary matters. (7) The Interstate Commission may develop rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by member boards. SECTION 8 JOINT INVESTIGATIONS (1) Licensure and disciplinary records of physicians are deemed investigative. (2) In addition to the authority granted to a member board by its respective medical practice act or other applicable state law, a member board may participate with other member boards in joint investigations of physicians licensed by the member boards. (3) A subpoena issued by a member state is enforceable in other member states. (4) Member boards may share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact. (5) Any member state may investigate actual or alleged violations of the statutes authorizing the practice of medicine in any other member state in which a physician holds a license to practice medicine. SECTION 9 DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS (1) Any disciplinary action taken by any member board against a physician licensed through the compact is deemed unprofessional conduct that may be subject to discipline by other member boards, in addition to any violation of the medical practice act or regulations in that state. (2) If a license granted to a physician by the member board in the state of principal license is revoked, surrendered or relinquished in lieu of discipline, or suspended, then all licenses issued to the physician by member boards shall automatically be placed, without further action necessary by any member board, on the same status. If the member board in the state of principal license subsequently reinstates the physician’s license, a license issued to the physician by any other member board must remain encumbered until that respective member board takes action to reinstate the license in a manner consistent with the medical practice act of that state. (3) If disciplinary action is taken against a physician by a member board not in the state of principal license, any other member board may deem the action conclusive as to matter of law and fact decided, and: (a) Impose the same or lesser sanctions against the physician so long as such sanctions are consistent with the medical practice act of that state; or (b) Pursue separate disciplinary action against the physician under its respective medical practice act, regardless of the action taken in other member states. (4) If a license granted to a physician by a member board is revoked, surrendered or relinquished in lieu of discipline, or suspended, any license issued to the physician by any other member board must be suspended, automatically and immediately without further action necessary by the other member boards, for 90 days after entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the member boards to investigate the basis for the action under the medical practice act of that state. A member board may terminate the automatic suspension of the license it issued before the completion of the 90-day suspension period in a manner consistent with the medical practice act of that state. SECTION 10 INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION (1) The member states hereby create the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission. (2) The purpose of the Interstate Commission is the administration of the compact, which is a discretionary state function. (3) The Interstate Commission is a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and has all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth in the compact, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the terms of the compact. (4) The Interstate Commission shall consist of two voting representatives appointed by each member state, who shall serve as commissioners. In states where allopathic and osteopathic physicians are regulated by separate member boards, or if the licensing and disciplinary authority is split between multiple member boards within a member state, the member state shall appoint one representative from each member board. Each commissioner must be one of the following: (a) An allopathic or osteopathic physician appointed to a member board. (b) An executive director, an executive secretary, or a similar executive of a member board. (c) A member of the public appointed to a member board. (5) The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. A portion of this meeting must be a business meeting to address such matters as may properly come before the commission, including the election of officers. The chairperson may call additional meetings and shall call for a meeting upon the request of a majority of the member states. (6) The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be conducted by telecommunication or other electronic means. (7) Each commissioner participating at a meeting of the Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of commissioners constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the Interstate Commission. A commissioner may not delegate a vote to another commissioner. In the absence of its commissioner, a member state may delegate voting authority for a specified meeting to another person from that state who must meet the qualification requirements specified in subsection (4). (8) The Interstate Commission shall provide public notice of all meetings, and all meetings must be open to the public. The Interstate Commission may close a meeting, in full or in portion, where it determines by a two-thirds vote of the commissioners present that an open meeting would be likely to: (a) Relate solely to the internal personnel practices and procedures of the Interstate Commission; (b) Discuss matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal statute; (c) Discuss trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; (d) Involve accusing a person of a crime, or formally censuring a person; (e) Discuss information of a personal nature, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (f) Discuss investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes; or (g) Specifically relate to participation in a civil action or other legal proceeding. (9) The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes that fully describe all matters discussed in a meeting and provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, including a record of any roll call votes. (10) The Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records, to the extent not otherwise designated in the compact or by its rules, available to the public for inspection. (11) The Interstate Commission shall establish an executive committee, which shall include officers, members, and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee has the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session. When acting on behalf of the Interstate Commission, the executive committee shall oversee the administration of the compact, including enforcement and compliance with the compact and its bylaws and rules, and other duties as necessary. (12) The Interstate Commission may establish other committees for governance and administration of the compact. SECTION 11 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION The Interstate Commission has all of the following powers and duties: (1) Overseeing and maintaining the administration of the compact. (2) Adopting rules, which shall be binding to the extent and in the manner provided for in the compact.

(5) Establishing and appointing committees, including, but not limited to, an executive committee as required by Section 11, which shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission in carrying out its powers and duties. (6) Paying for or providing for the payment of the expenses related to the establishment, organization, and ongoing activities of the Interstate Commission. (7) Establishing and maintaining one or more offices. (8) Borrowing, accepting, hiring, or contracting for services of personnel. (9) Purchasing and maintaining insurance and bonds.

(11) Establishing personnel policies and programs relating to conflicts of interest, rates of compensation, and qualifications of personnel. (12) Accepting donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services and receiving, using, and disposing of them in a manner consistent with the conflict-of-interest policies established by the Interstate Commission. (13) Leasing, purchasing, accepting contributions or donations of, or otherwise owning, holding, improving, or using any property, real, personal, or mixed. (14) Selling, conveying, mortgaging, pledging, leasing, exchanging, abandoning, or otherwise disposing of any property, real, personal, or mixed. (15) Establishing a budget and making expenditures. (16) Adopting a seal and bylaws governing the management and operation of the Interstate Commission. (17) Reporting annually to the legislatures and governors of the member states concerning the activities of the Interstate Commission during the preceding year. Such reports must also include reports of financial audits and any recommendations that may have been adopted by the Interstate Commission. (18) Coordinating education, training, and public awareness regarding the compact and its implementation and operation. (19) Maintaining records in accordance with the bylaws. (20) Seeking and obtaining trademarks, copyrights, and patents. (21) Performing any other functions necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the compact. SECTION 12 FINANCE POWERS (1) The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff. The total assessment, subject to appropriation, must be sufficient to cover the annual budget approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment amount must be allocated upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall adopt a rule binding upon all member states. (2) The Interstate Commission may not incur obligations of any kind before securing the funds adequate to meet the same. (3) The Interstate Commission may not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by, and with the authority of, the member state. (4) The Interstate Commission is subject to an annual financial audit conducted by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit must be included in the annual report of the Interstate Commission. SECTION 13 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION (1) The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of commissioners present and voting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact within 12 months after the first Interstate Commission meeting. (2) The Interstate Commission shall elect or appoint annually from among its commissioners a chairperson, a vice chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson, or in the chairperson’s absence or disability, the vice chairperson, shall preside over all meetings of the Interstate Commission. (3) Officers selected pursuant to subsection (2) shall serve without remuneration from the Interstate Commission. (4) The officers and employees of the Interstate Commission are immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of, or relating to, an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that such person is not protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. (a) The liability of the executive director and employees of the Interstate Commission or representatives of the Interstate Commission, acting within the scope of such person’s employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person’s state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. (b) The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend such persons in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person. (c) To the extent not covered by the state involved, the member state, or the Interstate Commission, the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission must be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons. SECTION 14 RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION (1) The Interstate Commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact. However, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission is invalid and has no force or effect. (2) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission must be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the “Model State Administrative Procedure Act” of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto. (3) Not later than 30 days after a rule is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court must give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the Interstate Commission. SECTION 15 OVERSIGHT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT (1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. The compact and the rules adopted hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but do not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine. (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission. (3) The Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, the compact, or adopted rules, as applicable. SECTION 16 ENFORCEMENT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT (1) The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact. (2) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the compact and its adopted rules and bylaws against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (3) The remedies herein are not the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession. SECTION 17 DEFAULT PROCEDURES (1) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact, or the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission adopted under the compact. (2) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, or the bylaws or adopted rules, the Interstate Commission shall: (a) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and (b) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (3) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact terminate on the effective date of the termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default. (4) Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate must be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states. (5) The Interstate Commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state, or the withdrawal of a member state. (6) The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination. (7) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state. (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney fees. SECTION 18 DISPUTE RESOLUTION (1) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes that are subject to the compact and that may arise among member states or member boards. (2) The Interstate Commission shall adopt rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate. SECTION 19 MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND AMENDMENT (1) Any state is eligible to become a member state of the compact. (2) The compact becomes effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than seven states. Thereafter, it becomes effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. (3) The governors of nonmember states, or their designees, must be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis before adoption of the compact by all states. (4) The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment becomes effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states. SECTION 20 WITHDRAWAL (1) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each member state. However, a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law. (2) Withdrawal from the compact must be made by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but the withdrawal shall not take effect until 1 year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state. (3) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state. (4) The Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within 60 days after receipt of notice provided under subsection (3). (5) The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. (6) Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission. (7) The Interstate Commission may develop rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on licenses granted in other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of principal license. SECTION 21 DISSOLUTION (1) The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one member state. (2) Upon the dissolution of the compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission must be concluded, and surplus funds of the Interstate Commission must be distributed in accordance with the bylaws. SECTION 22 SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION (1) The provisions of the compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact remain enforceable. (2) The provisions of the compact must be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.

If a telehealth provider conducts a patient evaluation sufficient to diagnose and treat the patient, the telehealth provider is not required to research a patient’s medical history or conduct a physical examination of the patient before using telehealth to provide health care services to the patient. (c) A telehealth provider may not use telehealth to prescribe a controlled substance listed in Schedule II of s. 893.03 unless the controlled substance is prescribed for the following: 1.

(3) RECORDS.—A telehealth provider shall document in the patient’s medical record the health care services rendered using telehealth according to the same standard as used for in-person services. Medical records, including video, audio, electronic, or other records generated as a result of providing such services, are confidential pursuant to ss. 395.3025(4) and 456.057. (4) REGISTRATION OF OUT-OF-STATE TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS.— (a) A health care professional not licensed in this state may provide health care services to a patient located in this state using telehealth if the health care professional registers with the applicable board, or the department if there is no board, and provides health care services within the applicable scope of practice established by Florida law or rule. (b) The board, or the department if there is no board, shall register a health care professional not licensed in this state as a telehealth provider if the health care professional: 1. Completes an application in the format prescribed by the department; 2. Is licensed with an active, unencumbered license that is issued by another state, the District of Columbia, or a possession or territory of the United States and that is substantially similar to a license issued to a Florida-licensed provider specified in paragraph (1)(b); 3. Has not been the subject of disciplinary action relating to his or her license during the 5-year period immediately prior to the submission of the application; 4. Designates a duly appointed registered agent for service of process in this state on a form prescribed by the department; and 5. Demonstrates to the board, or the department if there is no board, that he or she is in compliance with paragraph (e). The department shall use the National Practitioner Data Bank to verify the information submitted under this paragraph, as applicable. (c) The website of a telehealth provider registered under paragraph (b) must prominently display a hyperlink to the department’s website containing information required under paragraph (h). (d) A health care professional may not register under this subsection if his or her license to provide health care services is subject to a pending disciplinary investigation or action, or has been revoked in any state or jurisdiction. A health care professional registered under this subsection must notify the appropriate board, or the department if there is no board, of restrictions placed on his or her license to practice, or any disciplinary action taken or pending against him or her, in any state or jurisdiction. The notification must be provided within 5 business days after the restriction is placed or disciplinary action is initiated or taken. (e) A provider registered under this subsection shall maintain professional liability coverage or financial responsibility, that includes coverage or financial responsibility for telehealth services provided to patients not located in the provider’s home state, in an amount equal to or greater than the requirements for a licensed practitioner under s. 456.048, s. 458.320, or s. 459.0085, as applicable. (f) A health care professional registered under this subsection may not open an office in this state and may not provide in-person health care services to patients located in this state. (g) A pharmacist registered under this subsection may only use a pharmacy permitted under chapter 465, a nonresident pharmacy registered under s. 465.0156, or a nonresident pharmacy or outsourcing facility holding an active permit pursuant to s. 465.0158 to dispense medicinal drugs to patients located in this state. (h) The department shall publish on its website a list of all registrants and include, to the extent applicable, each registrant’s: 1. Name. 2. Health care occupation. 3. Completed health care training and education, including completion dates and any certificates or degrees obtained. 4. Out-of-state health care license with the license number. 5.

The name and address of the registered agent designated for service of process in this state. (i) The board, or the department if there is no board, may take disciplinary action against an out-of-state telehealth provider registered under this subsection if the registrant: 1. Fails to notify the applicable board, or the department if there is no board, of any adverse actions taken against his or her license as required under paragraph (d). 2. Has restrictions placed on or disciplinary action taken against his or her license in any state or jurisdiction. 3. Violates any of the requirements of this section. 4. Commits any act that constitutes grounds for disciplinary action under s. 456.072(1) or the applicable practice act for Florida-licensed providers. Disciplinary action taken by a board, or the department if there is no board, under this paragraph may include suspension or revocation of the provider’s registration or the issuance of a reprimand or letter of concern. A suspension may be accompanied by a corrective action plan as determined by the board, or the department if there is no board, the completion of which may lead to the suspended registration being reinstated according to rules adopted by the board, or the department if there is no board. (5) VENUE.—For the purposes of this section, any act that constitutes the delivery of health care services is deemed to occur at the place where the patient is located at the time the act is performed or in the patient’s county of residence. Venue for a civil or administrative action initiated by the department, the appropriate board, or a patient who receives telehealth services from an out-of-state telehealth provider may be located in the patient’s county of residence or in Leon County. (6) EXEMPTIONS.—A health care professional who is not licensed to provide health care services in this state but who holds an active license to provide health care services in another state or jurisdiction, and who provides health care services using telehealth to a patient located in this state, is not subject to the registration requirement under this section if the services are provided: (a) In response to an emergency medical condition as defined in s. 395.002; or (b) In consultation with a health care professional licensed in this state who has ultimate authority over the diagnosis and care of the patient. (7) RULEMAKING.—The applicable board, or the department if there is no board, may adopt rules to administer this section.

X of the State Constitution and ss. 458.331(1)(t), (4), and (5) and 459.015(1)(x), (4), and (5): (a) “Board” means the Board of Medicine, in the case of a physician licensed pursuant to chapter 458, or the Board of Osteopathic Medicine, in the case of an osteopathic physician licensed pursuant to chapter 459. (b) “Final administrative agency decision” means a final order of the licensing board following a hearing as provided in s. 120.57(1) or (2) or s. 120.574 finding that the licensee has violated s. 458.331(1)(t) or s. 459.015(1)(x). (c) “Found to have committed” means the malpractice has been found in a final judgment of a court of law, final administrative agency decision, or decision of binding arbitration. (d) “Incident” means the wrongful act or occurrence from which the medical malpractice arises, regardless of the number of claimants or findings. For purposes of this section: 1. A single act of medical malpractice, regardless of the number of claimants, shall count as only one incident. 2. Multiple findings of medical malpractice arising from the same wrongful act or series of wrongful acts associated with the treatment of the same patient shall count as only one incident. (e) “Level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure” means the standard of care specified in s. 766.102. (f) “Medical doctor” means a physician licensed pursuant to chapter 458 or chapter 459. (g) “Medical malpractice” means the failure to practice medicine in accordance with the level of care, skill, and treatment recognized in general law related to health care licensure. Only for the purpose of finding repeated medical malpractice pursuant to this section, any similar wrongful act, neglect, or default committed in another state or country which, if committed in this state, would have been considered medical malpractice as defined in this paragraph, shall be considered medical malpractice if the standard of care and burden of proof applied in the other state or country equaled or exceeded that used in this state. (h) “Repeated medical malpractice” means three or more incidents of medical malpractice found to have been committed by a medical doctor. Only an incident occurring on or after November 2, 2004, shall be considered an incident for purposes of finding repeated medical malpractice under this section. (2) For purposes of implementing s. 26, Art. X of the State Constitution, the board shall not license or continue to license a medical doctor found to have committed repeated medical malpractice, the finding of which was based upon clear and convincing evidence. In order to rely on an incident of medical malpractice to determine whether a license must be denied or revoked under this section, if the facts supporting the finding of the incident of medical malpractice were determined on a standard less stringent than clear and convincing evidence, the board shall review the record of the case and determine whether the finding would be supported under a standard of clear and convincing evidence. Section 456.073 applies. The board may verify on a biennial basis an out-of-state licensee’s medical malpractice history using federal, state, or other databases. The board may require licensees and applicants for licensure to provide a copy of the record of the trial of any medical malpractice judgment, which may be required to be in an electronic format, involving an incident that occurred on or after November 2, 2004. For purposes of implementing s. 26, Art. X of the State Constitution, the 90-day requirement for granting or denying a complete allopathic or osteopathic licensure application in s. 120.60(1) is extended to 180 days.
