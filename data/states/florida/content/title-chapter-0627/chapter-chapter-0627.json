The maintenance of such records in the office of a licensed rating organization of which an insurer is a member or subscriber will be sufficient compliance with this section for any such insurer maintaining membership or subscribership in such organization, to the extent that the insurer uses the rates, rating plans, rating systems, or underwriting rules of such organization. Such records shall be maintained in an office within this state or shall be made available for examination or inspection within this state by the department at any time upon reasonable notice.History.—s. 17, ch. 67-9; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 348, 357, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; ss. 49, 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318; s. 1099, ch. 2003-261.",

If the request is not granted within 30 days after it is made, the requester may treat it as rejected. Any person aggrieved by the refusal of an insurer or rating organization to grant the review requested, or by the failure or refusal to grant all or part of the relief requested, may file a written complaint with the office, specifying the grounds relied upon. If the office has already disposed of the issue as raised by a similar complaint or believes that probable cause for the complaint does not exist or that the complaint is not made in good faith, it shall so notify the complainant. Otherwise, and if it also finds that the complaint charges a violation of this chapter and that the complainant would be aggrieved if the violation is proven, it shall proceed as provided in subsection (2).(2)If after examination of an insurer, rating organization, advisory organization, or group, association, or other organization of insurers which engages in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance, upon the basis of other information, or upon sufficient complaint as provided in subsection (1), the office has good cause to believe that such insurer, organization, group, or association, or any rate, rating plan, or rating system made or used by any such insurer or rating organization, does not comply with the requirements and standards of this part applicable to it, it shall, unless it has good cause to believe such noncompliance is willful, give notice in writing to such insurer, organization, group, or association stating therein in what manner and to what extent noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying therein a reasonable time, not less than 10 days thereafter, in which the noncompliance may be corrected, including any premium adjustment.(3)If the office has good cause to believe that such noncompliance is willful or if, within the period prescribed by the office in the notice required by subsection (2), the insurer, organization, group, or association does not make such changes as may be necessary to correct the noncompliance specified by the office or establish to the satisfaction of the office that such specified noncompliance does not exist, then the office is required to proceed to further determine the matter. If no notice has been given as provided in subsection (2), the notice shall state in what manner and to what extent noncompliance is alleged to exist. The proceedings shall not consider any subject not specified in the notice required by subsections (2) and (3).History.—s. 447, ch. 59-205; s. 20, ch. 67-9; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 21, ch. 78-95; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 355, 357, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; ss. 49, 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318; s. 5, ch. 93-289; s. 322, ch. 97-102; s. 1109, ch. 2003-261.",

      "text": "As used in ss. 627.730-627.7405, the term:(1)“Broker” means any person not possessing a license under chapter 395, chapter 400, chapter 429, chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, chapter 461, or chapter 641 who charges or receives compensation for any use of medical equipment and is not the 100-percent owner or the 100-percent lessee of such equipment. For purposes of this section, such owner or lessee may be an individual, a corporation, a partnership, or any other entity and any of its 100-percent-owned affiliates and subsidiaries. For purposes of this subsection, the term “lessee” means a long-term lessee under a capital or operating lease, but does not include a part-time lessee. The term “broker” does not include a hospital or physician management company whose medical equipment is ancillary to the practices managed, a debt collection agency, or an entity that has contracted with the insurer to obtain a discounted rate for such services; nor does the term include a management company that has contracted to provide general management services for a licensed physician or health care facility and whose compensation is not materially affected by the usage or frequency of usage of medical equipment or an entity that is 100-percent owned by one or more hospitals or physicians. The term “broker” does not include a person or entity that certifies, upon request of an insurer, that:(a)It is a clinic licensed under ss. 400.990-400.995;(b)It is a 100-percent owner of medical equipment; and(c)The owner’s only part-time lease of medical equipment for personal injury protection patients is on a temporary basis not to exceed 30 days in a 12-month period, and such lease is solely for the purposes of necessary repair or maintenance of the 100-percent-owned medical equipment or pending the arrival and installation of the newly purchased or a replacement for the 100-percent-owned medical equipment, or for patients for whom, because of physical size or claustrophobia, it is determined by the medical director or clinical director to be medically necessary that the test be performed in medical equipment that is open-style. The leased medical equipment cannot be used by patients who are not patients of the registered clinic for medical treatment of services. Any person or entity making a false certification under this subsection commits insurance fraud as defined in s. 817.234. However, the 30-day period provided in this paragraph may be extended for an additional 60 days as applicable to magnetic resonance imaging equipment if the owner certifies that the extension otherwise complies with this paragraph.(2)“Medically necessary” refers to a medical service or supply that a prudent physician would provide for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing, or treating an illness, injury, disease, or symptom in a manner that is:(a)In accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice;(b)Clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and(c)Not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other health care provider.(3)“Motor vehicle” means any self-propelled vehicle with four or more wheels which is of a type both designed and required to be licensed for use on the highways of this state and any trailer or semitrailer designed for use with such vehicle and includes:(a)A “private passenger motor vehicle,” which is any motor vehicle which is a sedan, station wagon, or jeep-type vehicle and, if not used primarily for occupational, professional, or business purposes, a motor vehicle of the pickup, panel, van, camper, or motor home type.(b)A “commercial motor vehicle,” which is any motor vehicle which is not a private passenger motor vehicle.The term “motor vehicle” does not include a mobile home or any motor vehicle which is used in mass transit, other than public school transportation, and designed to transport more than five passengers exclusive of the operator of the motor vehicle and which is owned by a municipality, a transit authority, or a political subdivision of the state.(4)“Named insured” means a person, usually the owner of a vehicle, identified in a policy by name as the insured under the policy.(5)“Owner” means a person who holds the legal title to a motor vehicle; or, in the event a motor vehicle is the subject of a security agreement or lease with an option to purchase with the debtor or lessee having the right to possession, then the debtor or lessee shall be deemed the owner for the purposes of ss. 627.730-627.7405.(6)“Relative residing in the same household” means a relative of any degree by blood or by marriage who usually makes her or his home in the same family unit, whether or not temporarily living elsewhere.(7)“Certify” means to swear or attest to being true or represented in writing.(8)“Immediate personal supervision,” as it relates to the performance of medical services by nonphysicians not in a hospital, means that an individual licensed to perform the medical service or provide the medical supplies must be present within the confines of the physical structure where the medical services are performed or where the medical supplies are provided such that the licensed individual can respond immediately to any emergencies if needed.(9)“Incident,” with respect to services considered as incident to a physician’s professional service, for a physician licensed under chapter 458, chapter 459, chapter 460, or chapter 461, if not furnished in a hospital, means such services must be an integral, even if incidental, part of a covered physician’s service.(10)“Knowingly” means that a person, with respect to information, has actual knowledge of the information; acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or acts in reckless disregard of the information, and proof of specific intent to defraud is not required.(11)“Lawful” or “lawfully” means in substantial compliance with all relevant applicable criminal, civil, and administrative requirements of state and federal law related to the provision of medical services or treatment.(12)“Hospital” means a facility that, at the time services or treatment were rendered, was licensed under chapter 395.(13)“Properly completed” means providing truthful, substantially complete, and substantially accurate responses as to all material elements to each applicable request for information or statement by a means that may lawfully be provided and that complies with this section, or as agreed by the parties.(14)“Upcoding” means an action that submits a billing code that would result in payment greater in amount than would be paid using a billing code that accurately describes the services performed. The term does not include an otherwise lawful bill by a magnetic resonance imaging facility, which globally combines both technical and professional components, if the amount of the global bill is not more than the components if billed separately; however, payment of such a bill constitutes payment in full for all components of such service.(15)“Unbundling” means an action that submits a billing code that is properly billed under one billing code, but that has been separated into two or more billing codes, and would result in payment greater in amount than would be paid using one billing code.(16)“Emergency medical condition” means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, which may include severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following:(a)Serious jeopardy to patient health.(b)Serious impairment to bodily functions.(c)Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.(17)“Entity wholly owned” means a proprietorship, group practice, partnership, or corporation that provides health care services rendered by licensed health care practitioners and in which licensed health care practitioners are the business owners of all aspects of the business entity, including, but not limited to, being reflected as the business owners on the title or lease of the physical facility, filing taxes as the business owners, being account holders on the entity’s bank account, being listed as the principals on all incorporation documents required by this state, and having ultimate authority over all personnel and compensation decisions relating to the entity. However, this definition does not apply to an entity that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by a hospital licensed under chapter 395.History.—s. 3, ch. 71-252; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 2, ch. 78-374; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 551, 563, ch. 82-243; s. 68, ch. 82-386; s. 1, ch. 85-320; s. 5, ch. 86-182; s. 6, ch. 95-202; s. 1, ch. 97-84; s. 361, ch. 97-102; s. 5, ch. 2001-271; s. 18, ch. 2003-2; ss. 7, 19, ch. 2003-411; s. 30, ch. 2005-3; s. 98, ch. 2006-197; s. 10, ch. 2007-324; s. 9, ch. 2012-197.",

However, an insurer must receive the prior approval of its domiciliary insurance commissioner before writing any new financial guaranty insurance policies that would increase its risk of loss.(b)Must, for all guaranties in force prior to July 1, 1988, including those which fall under the definition of financial guaranty insurance, maintain the reserves applicable for municipal bond guaranties in effect prior to July 1, 1988. If the insurer’s contingency reserves maintained as of July 1, 1988, are less than those required for municipal bond guaranties, the insurer has 3 years to bring its reserves into compliance, except that a part of the reserve may be released proportional to the reduction in net total liabilities resulting from reinsurance if the reinsurer, on the effective date of the reinsurance, establishes a reserve in an amount equal to the amount released and except that a part of the reserve may be released with office approval, upon demonstration that the amount carried is excessive in relation to the corporation’s outstanding obligations.(c)Shall be subject to the reserve requirements applicable to financial guaranty insurance corporations, for business written on or after July 1, 1988.(d)This subsection shall not apply to insurers permitted to write financial guaranty insurance pursuant to the exception set forth in subsection (1) and such insurers may write financial guaranty insurance subject to the requirements of the Florida Insurance Code.History.—ss. 1, 6, ch. 88-87; s. 114, ch. 92-318; s. 1254, ch. 2003-261.",
