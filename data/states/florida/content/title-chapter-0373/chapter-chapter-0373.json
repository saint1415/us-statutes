      "text": "373.019 Definitions.—When appearing in this chapter or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant thereto, the term: (1) “Alternative water supplies” means salt water; brackish surface and groundwater; surface water captured predominately during wet-weather flows; sources made available through the addition of new storage capacity for surface or groundwater, water that has been reclaimed after one or more public supply, municipal, industrial, commercial, or agricultural uses; the downstream augmentation of water bodies with reclaimed water; stormwater; and any other water supply source that is designated as nontraditional for a water supply planning region in the applicable regional water supply plan. (2) “Capital costs” means planning, design, engineering, and project construction costs. (3) “Coastal waters” means waters of the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of America within the jurisdiction of the state. (4) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection or its successor agency or agencies. (5) “District water management plan” means the regional water resource plan developed by a governing board under s. 373.036. (6) “Domestic use” means the use of water for the individual personal household purposes of drinking, bathing, cooking, or sanitation. All other uses shall not be considered domestic. (7) “Florida water plan” means the state-level water resource plan developed by the department under s. 373.036. (8) “Governing board” means the governing board of a water management district. (9) “Groundwater” means water beneath the surface of the ground, whether or not flowing through known and definite channels. (10) “Impoundment” means any lake, reservoir, pond, or other containment of surface water occupying a bed or depression in the earth’s surface and having a discernible shoreline. (11) “Independent scientific peer review” means the review of scientific data, theories, and methodologies by a panel of independent, recognized experts in the fields of hydrology, hydrogeology, limnology, and other scientific disciplines relevant to the matters being reviewed under s. 373.042. (12) “Multijurisdictional water supply entity” means two or more water utilities or local governments that have organized into a larger entity, or entered into an interlocal agreement or contract, for the purpose of more efficiently pursuing water supply development or alternative water supply development projects listed pursuant to a regional water supply plan. (13) “Nonregulated use” means any use of water which is exempted from regulation by the provisions of this chapter. (14) “Other watercourse” means any canal, ditch, or other artificial watercourse in which water usually flows in a defined bed or channel. It is not essential that the flowing be uniform or uninterrupted. (15) “Person” means any and all persons, natural or artificial, including any individual, firm, association, organization, partnership, business trust, corporation, company, the United States of America, and the state and all political subdivisions, regions, districts, municipalities, and public agencies thereof. The enumeration herein is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. (16) “Reasonable-beneficial use” means the use of water in such quantity as is necessary for economic and efficient utilization for a purpose and in a manner which is both reasonable and consistent with the public interest. (17) “Reclaimed water” means water that has received at least secondary treatment and basic disinfection and is reused after flowing out of a domestic wastewater treatment facility. Reclaimed water is not subject to regulation pursuant to s. 373.175 or part II of this chapter until it has been discharged into waters as defined in s. 403.031. (18) “Reclaimed water distribution system” means a network of pipes, pumping facilities, storage facilities, and appurtenances designed to convey and distribute reclaimed water from one or more domestic wastewater treatment facilities to one or more users of reclaimed water. (19) “Regional water supply plan” means a detailed water supply plan developed by a governing board under s. 373.709. (20) “Stream” means any river, creek, slough, or natural watercourse in which water usually flows in a defined bed or channel. It is not essential that the flowing be uniform or uninterrupted. The fact that some part of the bed or channel has been dredged or improved does not prevent the watercourse from being a stream. (21) “Surface water” means water upon the surface of the earth, whether contained in bounds created naturally or artificially or diffused. Water from natural springs shall be classified as surface water when it exits from the spring onto the earth’s surface. (22) “Water” or “waters in the state” means any and all water on or beneath the surface of the ground or in the atmosphere, including natural or artificial watercourses, lakes, ponds, or diffused surface water and water percolating, standing, or flowing beneath the surface of the ground, as well as all coastal waters within the jurisdiction of the state. (23) “Water management district” means any flood control, resource management, or water management district operating under the authority of this chapter. (24) “Water resource development” means the formulation and implementation of regional water resource management strategies, including the collection and evaluation of surface water and groundwater data; structural and nonstructural programs to protect and manage water resources; the development of regional water resource implementation programs; the construction, operation, and maintenance of major public works facilities to provide for flood control, surface and underground water storage, and groundwater recharge augmentation; and related technical assistance to local governments, government-owned and privately owned water utilities, and self-suppliers to the extent assistance to self-suppliers promotes the policies as set forth in s. 373.016. (25) “Water resource implementation rule” means the rule authorized by s. 373.036, which sets forth goals, objectives, and guidance for the development and review of programs, rules, and plans relating to water resources, based on statutory policies and directives. The waters of the state are among its most basic resources. Such waters should be managed to conserve and protect water resources and to realize the full beneficial use of these resources. (26) “Water supply development” means the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of public or private facilities for water collection, production, treatment, transmission, or distribution for sale, resale, or end use. (27) For the sole purpose of serving as the basis for the unified statewide methodology adopted pursuant to s. 373.421(1), as amended, “wetlands” means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and a duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils. Soils present in wetlands generally are classified as hydric or alluvial, or possess characteristics that are associated with reducing soil conditions. The prevalent vegetation in wetlands generally consists of facultative or obligate hydrophytic macrophytes that are typically adapted to areas having soil conditions described above. These species, due to morphological, physiological, or reproductive adaptations, have the ability to grow, reproduce, or persist in aquatic environments or anaerobic soil conditions. Florida wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bayheads, bogs, cypress domes and strands, sloughs, wet prairies, riverine swamps and marshes, hydric seepage slopes, tidal marshes, mangrove swamps and other similar areas. Florida wetlands generally do not include longleaf or slash pine flatwoods with an understory dominated by saw palmetto. Upon legislative ratification of the methodology adopted pursuant to s. 373.421(1), as amended, the limitation contained herein regarding the purpose of this definition shall cease to be effective. (28) “Works of the district” means those projects and works, including, but not limited to, structures, impoundments, wells, streams, and other watercourses, together with the appurtenant facilities and accompanying lands, which have been officially adopted by the governing board of the district as works of the district.

(2) An “artesian well” is defined as an artificial hole in the ground from which water supplies may be obtained and which penetrates any water-bearing rock, the water in which is raised to the surface by natural flow, or which rises to an elevation above the top of the water-bearing bed. “Artesian wells” are defined further to include all holes, drilled as a source of water, that penetrate any water-bearing beds that are a part of the artesian water system of Florida, as determined by representatives of the Florida Geological Survey or the Department of Environmental Protection. (3) “Plugging” is defined as plugging, capping, or otherwise controlling a well as deemed appropriate by the department or by the appropriate water management district. (4) “Waste” is defined to be the causing, suffering, or permitting any water flowing from, or being pumped from, an artesian well to run into any river, creek, or other natural watercourse or channel, or into any bay or pond (unless used thereafter for the beneficial purposes of irrigation of land, mining, or other industrial purposes of domestic use), or into any street, road or highway, or upon the land of any person, or upon the public lands of the United States or of the state, unless it is used thereon for the beneficial purposes of the irrigation thereof, industrial purposes, domestic use, or the propagation of fish.

      "text": "373.406 Exemptions.—The following exemptions shall apply: (1) Nothing herein, or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant hereto, shall be construed to affect the right of any natural person to capture, discharge, and use water for purposes permitted by law. (2) Notwithstanding s. 403.927, nothing herein, or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant hereto, shall be construed to affect the right of any person engaged in the occupation of agriculture, silviculture, floriculture, or horticulture to alter the topography of any tract of land, including, but not limited to, activities that may impede or divert the flow of surface waters or adversely impact wetlands, for purposes consistent with the normal and customary practice of such occupation in the area. However, such alteration or activity may not be for the sole or predominant purpose of impeding or diverting the flow of surface waters or adversely impacting wetlands. This exemption applies to lands classified as agricultural pursuant to s. 193.461 and to activities requiring an environmental resource permit pursuant to this part. This exemption does not apply to any activities previously authorized by an environmental resource permit or a management and storage of surface water permit issued pursuant to this part or a dredge and fill permit issued pursuant to chapter 403. This exemption has retroactive application to July 1, 1984. (3) Nothing herein, or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant hereto, shall be construed to be applicable to construction, operation, or maintenance of any agricultural closed system. However, part II of this chapter shall be applicable as to the taking and discharging of water for filling, replenishing, and maintaining the water level in any such agricultural closed system. This subsection shall not be construed to eliminate the necessity to meet generally accepted engineering practices for construction, operation, and maintenance of dams, dikes, or levees. (4) All rights and restrictions set forth in this section shall be enforced by the governing board or the Department of Environmental Protection or its successor agency, and nothing contained herein shall be construed to establish a basis for a cause of action for private litigants. (5) The department or the governing board may by rule establish general permits for stormwater management systems which have, either singularly or cumulatively, minimal environmental impact. The department or the governing board also may establish by rule exemptions or general permits that implement interagency agreements entered into pursuant to s. 373.046, s. 378.202, s. 378.205, or s. 378.402. (6) Any district or the department may exempt from regulation under this part those activities that the district or department determines will have only minimal or insignificant individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the water resources of the district. The district and the department are authorized to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a specific activity comes within this exemption. Requests to qualify for this exemption shall be submitted in writing to the district or department, and such activities shall not be commenced without a written determination from the district or department confirming that the activity qualifies for the exemption. (7) Nothing in this part, or in any rule or order adopted under this part, may be construed to require a permit for mining activities for which an operator receives a life-of-the-mine permit under s. 378.901. (8) Certified aquaculture activities which apply appropriate best management practices adopted pursuant to s. 597.004 are exempt from this part. (9) Implementation of measures having the primary purpose of environmental restoration or water quality improvement on agricultural lands are exempt from regulation under this part where these measures or practices are determined by the district or department, on a case-by-case basis, to have minimal or insignificant individual and cumulative adverse impact on the water resources of the state. The district or department shall provide written notification as to whether the proposed activity qualifies for the exemption within 30 days after receipt of a written notice requesting the exemption. No activity under this exemption shall commence until the district or department has provided written notice that the activity qualifies for the exemption. (10) Implementation of interim measures or best management practices adopted pursuant to s. 403.067 that are by rule designated as having minimal individual or cumulative adverse impacts to the water resources of the state are exempt from regulation under this part. (11) Any district or the department may adopt rules to exempt from regulation under this part any system for a mining or mining-related activity that is described in or covered by an exemption confirmation letter issued by the district pursuant to applicable rules implementing this part that were in effect at the time the letter was issued, and that will not be harmful to the water resources. Such rules may include provisions for the duration of this exemption. (12) An overwater pier, dock, or a similar structure located in a deepwater port listed in s. 311.09 is not considered to be part of a stormwater management system for which this chapter or chapter 403 requires stormwater from impervious surfaces to be treated if: (a) The port has a stormwater pollution prevention plan for industrial activities pursuant to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program; and (b) The stormwater pollution prevention plan also provides similar pollution prevention measures for other activities that are not subject to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program and that occur on the port’s overwater piers, docks, and similar structures. (13) Nothing in this part, or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant to this part, applies to construction, alteration, operation, or maintenance of any wholly owned, manmade excavated farm ponds, as defined in s. 403.927, constructed entirely in uplands. Alteration or maintenance may not involve any work to connect the farm pond to, or expand the farm pond into, other wetlands or other surface waters. This exemption does not apply to any farm pond that covers an area greater than 15 acres and has an average depth greater than 15 feet, or is less than 50 feet from any wetlands. (14) Nothing in this part, or in any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant to this part, may require a permit for activities affecting wetlands created solely by the unauthorized flooding or interference with the natural flow of surface water caused by an unaffiliated adjoining landowner. Requests to qualify for this exemption must be made within 7 years after the cause of such unauthorized flooding or unauthorized interference with the natural flow of surface water and must be submitted in writing to the district or department. Such activities may not begin without a written determination from the district or department confirming that the activity qualifies for the exemption. This exemption does not expand the jurisdiction of the department or the water management districts and does not apply to activities that discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, subject to federal jurisdiction under s. 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. s. 1344.

(2) If during construction or alteration the governing board or department finds that the work is not being done in accordance with the approved plans and specifications as indicated in the permit, it shall give the permittee written notice stating with which particulars of the approved plans and specifications the construction is not in compliance and shall order immediate compliance with such plans and specifications. The failure to act in accordance with the orders of the governing board or department after receipt of written notice shall result in the initiation of revocation proceedings in accordance with s. 373.429. (3) Upon completion of the work, the executive director of the district or the Department of Environmental Protection or its successor agency shall have periodic inspections made of permitted stormwater management systems, dams, reservoirs, impoundments, appurtenant work, or works to protect the public health and safety and the natural resources of the state. No person shall refuse immediate entry or access to any authorized representative of the governing board or the department who requests entry for purposes of such inspection and presents appropriate credentials. (4)(a) By September 1, 2026, the department shall submit a Flood Inventory and Restoration Report to the Division of Emergency Management. The department must work with water management districts, local governments, and operators of public and private stormwater management systems to compile the necessary information for the report, which must: 1. Identify priority infrastructure needs within each water management district jurisdiction that may result in flooding or property damage or threaten human health if left unaddressed; 2. Identify locations that have both historic flooding occurrences, based on flood zones identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the potential to flood from future significant storm events, such as hurricanes and tropical storms; 3. For each location identified in subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., include an inspection and maintenance schedule and specific information on the age of the infrastructure, upstream impacts, and other factors that may lead to system failure if unaddressed; and 4. Include a list of facilities prioritized for funding to address flooding issues. (b) The owner of any priority infrastructure identified in the report must submit an inspection and maintenance schedule to the department. (c) The department must review and update the report on a biannual basis. The report must provide information regarding compliance with the inspection and maintenance schedules, include any additional revisions based on storm event experience, and revise the list of facilities as new flooding events take place and new projects are implemented to alleviate infrastructure deficiencies which led to flooding events. The department must submit an updated report to the Division of Emergency Management by September 1 of each year in which the report is due.

(2) The bonds to be issued by authority of this chapter shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the said board, shall recite that they are issued under the authority of this chapter, and shall pledge the faith and credit of the governing board of the district for the prompt payment of the interest and principal thereof. (3) Said bonds shall have all the qualities of negotiable paper under the Law Merchant, and shall not be invalid for any irregularity, or defect in the proceedings for the issue and sale thereof except forgery; and shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders thereof for value. The provisions of this chapter shall constitute an irrevocable contract between said board and the district and the holders of any bonds and the coupons thereof, issued pursuant to the provisions hereof. Any holder of any of said bonds or coupons may either at law or in equity by suit, action or mandamus enforce and compel the performance of the duties required by this chapter of any of the officers or persons mentioned in this chapter in relation to the said bonds, or to the collection, enforcement and application of the taxes for the payment thereof. (4) The amount of bonds to be issued in any one year, when added to the amount then outstanding, shall be not greater than can be supported for that year in accordance with the bond schedule out of 90 percent of the taxes imposed, or to be imposed, for that year, plus other moneys in the hands of the district usable for bond purposes after deducting therefrom amounts estimated to be required for maintenance and operation of the works of the district, cost of administration, and amounts for such other purposes as the governing board may determine, nor shall the governing board levy in any year taxes insufficient to support said bonds for such year on the basis herein described. (5) All bonds and coupons not paid at maturity shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed 7.5 percent per annum from maturity until paid, or until sufficient funds have been deposited at the place of payment. (6) The bonds to be issued by authority of this chapter shall be in denominations of not less than $100, bearing interest from date at a rate not to exceed 5 percent per annum, payable semiannually, to mature at annual intervals within 40 years commencing after a period of not later than 10 years, to be determined by said board, both principal and interest payable at some convenient place designated by said board to be named in said bonds, which said bonds shall be signed by the chair of the board, attested with the seal of said district and by the signature of the secretary of said board. In case any of the officers whose signatures, countersignatures, and certificates appear upon the said bonds and coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds to the purchaser, such signature or countersignature and certificate shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until the delivery of the bonds. (7) Interest coupons shall be attached to the said bonds and the said coupons shall be consecutively numbered, specifying the number of the bond to which they are attached, and shall be attested by the lithographed or engraved facsimile signature of the chair and secretary of said board. (8) In the discretion of said board, it may be provided that at any time, after such date as shall be fixed by the said board, said bonds may be redeemed before maturity at the option of said board, or its successors in office. If any bond so issued subject to redemption before maturity shall not be presented when called for redemption, it shall cease to bear interest from and after the date so fixed for redemption.

      "text": "373.802 Definitions.—As used in this part, the term: (1) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection, which includes the Florida Geological Survey or its successor agencies. (2) “Enhanced nutrient-reducing onsite sewage treatment and disposal system” means an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system approved by the department as capable of meeting or exceeding a 50 percent total nitrogen reduction before disposal of wastewater in the drainfield, or at least 65 percent total nitrogen reduction combined from the onsite sewage tank or tanks and drainfield. (3) “Local government” means a county or municipal government the jurisdictional boundaries of which include an Outstanding Florida Spring or any part of a springshed or delineated priority focus area of an Outstanding Florida Spring. (4) “Onsite sewage treatment and disposal system” means a system that contains a standard subsurface, filled, or mound drainfield system; an aerobic treatment unit; a graywater system tank; a laundry wastewater system tank; a septic tank; a grease interceptor; a pump tank; a solids or effluent pump; a waterless, incinerating, or organic waste-composting toilet; or a sanitary pit privy that is installed or proposed to be installed beyond the building sewer on land of the owner or on other land on which the owner has the legal right to install such system. The term includes any item placed within, or intended to be used as a part of or in conjunction with, the system. The term does not include package sewage treatment facilities and other treatment works regulated under chapter 403. (5) “Outstanding Florida Spring” includes all historic first magnitude springs, including their associated spring runs, as determined by the department using the most recent Florida Geological Survey springs bulletin, and the following additional springs, including their associated spring runs: (a) De Leon Springs; (b) Peacock Springs; (c) Poe Springs; (d) Rock Springs; (e) Wekiwa Springs; and (f) Gemini Springs. The term does not include submarine springs or river rises. (6) “Priority focus area” means the area or areas of a basin where the Floridan Aquifer is generally most vulnerable to pollutant inputs where there is a known connectivity between groundwater pathways and an Outstanding Florida Spring, as determined by the department in consultation with the appropriate water management districts, and delineated in a basin management action plan. (7) “Springshed” means the areas within the groundwater and surface water basins which contribute, based upon all relevant facts, circumstances, and data, to the discharge of a spring as defined by potentiometric surface maps and surface watershed boundaries. (8) “Spring run” means a body of flowing water that originates from a spring or whose primary source of water is a spring or springs under average rainfall conditions. (9) “Spring vent” means a location where groundwater flows out of a natural, discernible opening in the ground onto the land surface or into a predominantly fresh surface water body.
