      "text": "63.022 Legislative intent.— (1) The Legislature finds that: (a) The state has a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for adoptive children in a prompt manner, in preventing the disruption of adoptive placements, and in holding parents accountable for meeting the needs of children. (b) An unmarried mother faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions about the future of a newborn child is entitled to privacy, has the right to make timely and appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child, and is entitled to assurance regarding an adoptive placement. (c) Adoptive children have the right to permanence and stability in adoptive placements. (d) Adoptive parents have a constitutional privacy interest in retaining custody of a legally adopted child. (e) An unmarried biological father has an inchoate interest that acquires constitutional protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood, both during the pregnancy and after the child’s birth. The state has a compelling interest in requiring an unmarried biological father to demonstrate that commitment by providing appropriate medical care and financial support and by establishing legal paternity rights in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that in every adoption, the best interest of the child should govern and be of foremost concern in the court’s determination. The court shall make a specific finding as to the best interests of the child in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (3) It is the intent of the Legislature to protect and promote the well-being of persons being adopted and their birth and adoptive parents and to provide to all children who can benefit by it a permanent family life, and, whenever appropriate, to maintain sibling groups. (4) The basic safeguards intended to be provided by this chapter are that: (a) The minor is legally free for adoption and that all adoptions are handled in accordance with the requirements of law. (b) The required persons consent to the adoption or the parent-child relationship is terminated by judgment of the court. (c) The required social studies are completed and the court considers the reports of these studies prior to judgment on adoption petitions. (d) A sufficient period of time elapses during which the minor has lived within the proposed adoptive home under the guidance of an adoption entity, except stepparent adoptions or adoptions of a relative. (e) All expenditures by adoption entities or adoptive parents relative to the adoption of a minor are reported to the court and become a permanent record in the file of the adoption proceedings, including, but not limited to, all legal fees and costs, all payments to or on behalf of a birth parent, and all payments to or on behalf of the minor. (f) Social and medical information concerning the minor and the parents is furnished by the parent when available and filed with the court before a final hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights pending adoption, unless the petitioner is a stepparent or a relative. (g) A new birth certificate is issued after entry of the adoption judgment. (h) At the time of the hearing, the court may order temporary substitute care when it determines that the minor is in an unsuitable home. (i) The records of all proceedings concerning custody and adoption of a minor are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), except as provided in s. 63.162. (j) The birth parent, the prospective adoptive parent, and the minor receive, at a minimum, the safeguards, guidance, counseling, and supervision required in this chapter. (k) In all matters coming before the court under this chapter, the court shall enter such orders as it deems necessary and suitable to promote and protect the best interests of the person to be adopted. (l) In dependency cases initiated by the department, where termination of parental rights occurs, and siblings are separated despite diligent efforts of the department, continuing postadoption communication or contact among the siblings may be ordered by the court if found to be in the best interests of the children. (5) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for cooperation between private adoption entities and the Department of Children and Families in matters relating to permanent placement options for children in the care of the department whose birth parents wish to participate in a private adoption plan with a qualified family.

      "heading": "Procedures with respect to surrendered infants.",
      "text": "63.0423 Procedures with respect to surrendered infants.— (1) Upon entry of final judgment terminating parental rights, a licensed child-placing agency that takes physical custody of an infant surrendered pursuant to s. 383.50 assumes responsibility for the medical and other costs associated with the emergency services and care of the surrendered infant from the time the licensed child-placing agency takes physical custody of the surrendered infant. (2) The licensed child-placing agency shall immediately seek an order from the circuit court for emergency custody of the surrendered infant. The emergency custody order shall remain in effect until the court orders preliminary approval of placement of the surrendered infant in the prospective home, at which time the prospective adoptive parents become guardians pending termination of parental rights and finalization of adoption or until the court orders otherwise. The guardianship of the prospective adoptive parents shall remain subject to the right of the licensed child-placing agency to remove the surrendered infant from the placement during the pendency of the proceedings if such removal is deemed by the licensed child-placing agency to be in the best interests of the child. The licensed child-placing agency may immediately seek to place the surrendered infant in a prospective adoptive home. (3) The licensed child-placing agency that takes physical custody of the surrendered infant shall, within 24 hours thereafter, request assistance from law enforcement officials to investigate and determine, through the Missing Children Information Clearinghouse, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and any other national and state resources, whether the surrendered infant is a missing child. (4) The parent who surrenders the infant in accordance with s. 383.50 is presumed to have consented to termination of parental rights, and express consent is not required. Except when there is actual or suspected child abuse or neglect, the licensed child-placing agency may not attempt to pursue, search for, or notify that parent as provided in s. 63.088 and chapter 49. For purposes of s. 383.50 and this section, an infant who tests positive for illegal drugs, narcotic prescription drugs, alcohol, or other substances, but shows no other signs of child abuse or neglect, shall be placed in the custody of a licensed child-placing agency. Such a placement does not eliminate the reporting requirement under s. 383.50(8). When the department is contacted regarding an infant properly surrendered under this section and s. 383.50, the department shall provide instruction to contact a licensed child-placing agency and may not take custody of the infant unless reasonable efforts to contact a licensed child-placing agency to accept the infant have not been successful. (5) A petition for termination of parental rights under this section may not be filed until 30 days after the date the infant was surrendered in accordance with s. 383.50. A petition for termination of parental rights may not be granted until a parent has failed to reclaim or claim the surrendered infant within the time period specified in s. 383.50. (6) A claim of parental rights of the surrendered infant must be made to the entity having legal custody of the surrendered infant or to the circuit court before which proceedings involving the surrendered infant are pending. A claim of parental rights of the surrendered infant may not be made after the judgment to terminate parental rights is entered, except as otherwise provided by subsection (9). (7) If a claim of parental rights of a surrendered infant is made before the judgment to terminate parental rights is entered, the circuit court may hold the action for termination of parental rights in abeyance for a period of time not to exceed 60 days. (a) The court may order scientific testing to determine maternity or paternity at the expense of the parent claiming parental rights. (b) The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the surrendered infant and order any investigation, home evaluation, or psychological evaluation necessary to determine what is in the best interests of the surrendered infant. (c) The court may not terminate parental rights solely on the basis that the parent surrendered the infant in accordance with s. 383.50. (d) The court shall enter a judgment with written findings of fact and conclusions of law. (8) Within 7 business days after recording the judgment, the clerk of the court shall mail a copy of the judgment to the department, the petitioner, and any person whose consent was required, if known. The clerk shall execute a certificate of each mailing. (9)(a) A judgment terminating parental rights to a surrendered infant pending adoption is voidable, and any later judgment of adoption of that child is voidable, if, upon the motion of a parent, the court finds that a person knowingly gave false information that prevented the parent from timely making known his or her desire to assume parental responsibilities toward the child or from exercising his or her parental rights. A motion under this subsection must be filed with the court originally entering the judgment. The motion must be filed within a reasonable time but not later than 1 year after the entry of the judgment terminating parental rights. (b) No later than 30 days after the filing of a motion under this subsection, the court shall conduct a preliminary hearing to determine what contact, if any, will be allowed between a parent and the child pending resolution of the motion. Such contact may be allowed only if it is requested by a parent who has appeared at the hearing and the court determines that it is in the best interests of the child. If the court orders contact between a parent and the child, the order must be issued in writing as expeditiously as possible and must state with specificity any provisions regarding contact with persons other than those with whom the child resides. (c) The court may not order scientific testing to determine the paternity or maternity of the child until such time as the court determines that a previously entered judgment terminating the parental rights of that parent is voidable pursuant to paragraph (a), unless all parties agree that such testing is in the best interests of the child. Upon the filing of test results establishing that person’s maternity or paternity of the surrendered infant, the court may order visitation only if it appears to be in the best interests of the child. (d) Within 45 days after the preliminary hearing, the court shall conduct a final hearing on the motion to set aside the judgment and shall enter its written order as expeditiously as possible thereafter. (10) Except to the extent expressly provided in this section, proceedings initiated by a licensed child-placing agency for the termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption of an infant surrendered in accordance with s. 383.50 shall be conducted pursuant to this chapter.

(2) For minors who have been voluntarily surrendered to an intermediary through an execution of a consent to adoption, the intermediary shall be responsible for the minor until the time a court orders preliminary approval of placement of the minor in the prospective adoptive home, after which time the prospective adoptive parents shall become guardians pending finalization of adoption, subject to the intermediary’s right and responsibility to remove the child from the prospective adoptive home if the removal is deemed by the intermediary to be in the best interests of the child. The intermediary may not remove the child without a court order unless the child is in danger of imminent harm. The intermediary does not become responsible for the minor child’s medical bills that were incurred before taking physical custody of the child after the execution of adoption consents. Prior to the court’s entry of an order granting preliminary approval of the placement, the intermediary shall have the responsibility and authority to provide for the needs and welfare of the minor. A minor may not be placed in a prospective adoptive home until that home has received a favorable preliminary home study, as provided in s. 63.092, completed and approved within 1 year before such placement in the prospective home. The provisions of s. 627.6578 shall remain in effect notwithstanding the guardianship provisions in this section. (3) If a minor is surrendered to an adoption entity for subsequent adoption and a suitable prospective adoptive home is not available pursuant to s. 63.092 at the time the minor is surrendered to the adoption entity, the minor must be placed in a licensed foster care home, with a person or family that has received a favorable preliminary home study pursuant to subsection (2), or with a relative until a suitable prospective adoptive home is available. (4) If a minor is voluntarily surrendered to an adoption entity for subsequent adoption and the adoption does not become final within 180 days after termination of parental rights, the adoption entity must report to the court on the status of the minor and the court may at that time proceed under s. 39.701 or take action reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the minor. (5) The recital in a written consent, answer, or recommendation filed by an adoption entity that the minor has been permanently committed to the adoption entity or that the adoption entity is duly licensed shall be prima facie proof of such commitment. A consent for adoption signed by an adoption entity need not comply with s. 63.082. (6) Unless otherwise authorized by law or ordered by the court, the department is not responsible for expenses incurred by other adoption entities participating in a placement of a minor. (7) The court retains jurisdiction of a minor who has been placed for adoption until the adoption is final. After a minor is placed with an adoption entity or prospective adoptive parent, the court may review the status of the minor and the progress toward permanent adoptive placement.

(3) A parent who has been judicially declared incompetent and for whom restoration of competency is medically improbable.

      "text": "63.085 Disclosure by adoption entity.— (1) DISCLOSURE REQUIRED TO PARENTS AND PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE PARENTS.—Within 14 days after a person seeking to adopt a minor or a person seeking to place a minor for adoption contacts an adoption entity in person or provides the adoption entity with a mailing address, the entity must provide a written disclosure statement to that person if the entity agrees or continues to work with the person. The adoption entity shall also provide the written disclosure to the parent who did not initiate contact with the adoption entity within 14 days after that parent is identified and located. For purposes of providing the written disclosure, a person is considered to be seeking to place a minor for adoption if that person has sought information or advice from the adoption entity regarding the option of adoptive placement. The written disclosure statement must be in substantially the following form: ADOPTION DISCLOSURE THE STATE OF FLORIDA REQUIRES THAT THIS FORM BE PROVIDED TO ALL PERSONS CONSIDERING ADOPTING A MINOR OR SEEKING TO PLACE A MINOR FOR ADOPTION, TO ADVISE THEM OF THE FOLLOWING FACTS REGARDING ADOPTION UNDER FLORIDA LAW: 1. The name, address, and telephone number of the adoption entity providing this disclosure is: Name: Address: Telephone Number: 2. The adoption entity does not provide legal representation or advice to parents or anyone signing a consent for adoption or affidavit of nonpaternity, and parents have the right to consult with an attorney of their own choosing to advise them. 3. With the exception of an adoption by a stepparent or relative, a child cannot be placed into a prospective adoptive home unless the prospective adoptive parents have received a favorable preliminary home study, including criminal and child abuse clearances. 4. A valid consent for adoption may not be signed by the birth mother until 48 hours after the birth of the child, or the day the birth mother is notified, in writing, that she is fit for discharge from the licensed hospital or birth center. Any man may sign a valid consent for adoption at any time after the birth of the child. 5. A consent for adoption signed before the child attains the age of 6 months is binding and irrevocable from the moment it is signed unless it can be proven in court that the consent was obtained by fraud or duress. A consent for adoption signed after the child attains the age of 6 months is valid from the moment it is signed; however, it may be revoked up to 3 business days after it was signed. 6. A consent for adoption is not valid if the signature of the person who signed the consent was obtained by fraud or duress. 7. An unmarried biological father must act immediately in order to protect his parental rights. Section 63.062, Florida Statutes, prescribes that any father seeking to establish his right to consent to the adoption of his child must file a claim of paternity with the Florida Putative Father Registry maintained by the Office of Vital Statistics of the Department of Health by the date a petition to terminate parental rights is filed with the court, or within 30 days after receiving service of a Notice of Intended Adoption Plan. If he receives a Notice of Intended Adoption Plan, he must file a claim of paternity with the Florida Putative Father Registry, file a parenting plan with the court, and provide financial support to the mother or child within 30 days following service. An unmarried biological father’s failure to timely respond to a Notice of Intended Adoption Plan constitutes an irrevocable legal waiver of any and all rights that the father may have to the child. A claim of paternity registration form for the Florida Putative Father Registry may be obtained from any local office of the Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics, the Department of Children and Families, the Internet websites for these agencies, and the offices of the clerks of the Florida circuit courts. The claim of paternity form must be submitted to the Office of Vital Statistics, Attention: Adoption Unit, P.O. Box 210, Jacksonville, FL 32231. 8. There are alternatives to adoption, including foster care, relative care, and parenting the child. There may be services and sources of financial assistance in the community available to parents if they choose to parent the child. 9. A parent has the right to have a witness of his or her choice, who is unconnected with the adoption entity or the adoptive parents, to be present and witness the signing of the consent or affidavit of nonpaternity. 10. A parent 14 years of age or younger must have a parent, legal guardian, or court-appointed guardian ad litem to assist and advise the parent as to the adoption plan and to witness consent. 11. A parent has a right to receive supportive counseling from a counselor, social worker, physician, clergy, or attorney. 12. The payment of living or medical expenses by the prospective adoptive parents before the birth of the child does not, in any way, obligate the parent to sign the consent for adoption. (2) DISCLOSURE TO ADOPTIVE PARENTS.— (a) At the time that an adoption entity is responsible for selecting prospective adoptive parents for a born or unborn child whose parents are seeking to place the child for adoption or whose rights were terminated pursuant to chapter 39, the adoption entity must provide the prospective adoptive parents with information concerning the background of the child to the extent such information is disclosed to the adoption entity by the parents, legal custodian, or the department. This subsection applies only if the adoption entity identifies the prospective adoptive parents and supervises the placement of the child in the prospective adoptive parents’ home. If any information cannot be disclosed because the records custodian failed or refused to produce the background information, the adoption entity has a duty to provide the information if it becomes available. An individual or entity contacted by an adoption entity to obtain the background information must release the requested information to the adoption entity without the necessity of a subpoena or a court order. In all cases, the prospective adoptive parents must receive all available information by the date of the final hearing on the petition for adoption. The information to be disclosed includes: 1. A family social and medical history form completed pursuant to s. 63.162(6). 2. The biological mother’s medical records documenting her prenatal care and the birth and delivery of the child. 3. A complete set of the child’s medical records documenting all medical treatment and care since the child’s birth and before placement. 4. All mental health, psychological, and psychiatric records, reports, and evaluations concerning the child before placement. 5. The child’s educational records, including all records concerning any special education needs of the child before placement. 6. Records documenting all incidents that required the department to provide services to the child, including all orders of adjudication of dependency or termination of parental rights issued pursuant to chapter 39, any case plans drafted to address the child’s needs, all protective services investigations identifying the child as a victim, and all guardian ad litem reports filed with the court concerning the child. 7. Written information concerning the availability of adoption subsidies for the child, if applicable. (b) When disclosing information pursuant to this subsection, the adoption entity must redact any confidential identifying information concerning the child’s parents, foster parents and their families, siblings, relatives, and perpetrators of crimes against the child or involving the child. (c) If the prospective adoptive parents waive the receipt of any of the records described in paragraph (a), a copy of the written notification of the waiver to the adoption entity shall be filed with the court. (3) ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DISCLOSURE.—The adoption entity must obtain a written statement acknowledging receipt of the disclosures required under this section and signed by the persons receiving the disclosure or, if it is not possible to obtain such an acknowledgment, the adoption entity must execute an affidavit stating why an acknowledgment could not be obtained. If the disclosure was delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, a return receipt signed by the person from whom acknowledgment is required is sufficient to meet the requirements of this subsection. A copy of the acknowledgment of receipt of the disclosure must be provided to the person signing it. A copy of the acknowledgment or affidavit executed by the adoption entity in lieu of the acknowledgment must be maintained in the file of the adoption entity. The original acknowledgment or affidavit must be filed with the court. (4) REVOCATION OF CONSENT.—Failure to meet the requirements of this section does not constitute grounds for revocation of a consent to adoption or withdrawal of an affidavit of nonpaternity unless the extent and circumstances of such a failure result in a material failure of fundamental fairness in the administration of due process, or the failure constitutes or contributes materially to fraud or duress in obtaining a consent to adoption or affidavit of nonpaternity.

The response must inform the prospective adoptive parent of the adoption process and the requirements for adopting a child from the child welfare system. (2) The department or community-based care lead agency, or its subcontracted agency, must refer a prospective adoptive parent who is interested in adopting a child in the custody of the department to a department-approved adoptive parent training program. A prospective adoptive parent must successfully complete the training program, unless the prospective adoptive parent is a licensed foster parent or a relative or nonrelative caregiver who has: (a) Attended the training program within the last 5 years; or (b) Had the child who is available for adoption placed in their home for 6 months or longer and has been determined to understand the challenges and parenting skills needed to successfully parent the child who is available for adoption. (3) A prospective adoptive parent must complete an adoption application created by the department. (4) Before a child is placed in an adoptive home, the community-based care lead agency or its subcontracted agency must complete an adoptive home study of a prospective adoptive parent that includes observation, screening, and evaluation of the child and the prospective adoptive parent. An adoptive home study must be updated every 12 months after the date on which the first study was approved. If the child was placed before the termination of parental rights, the updated placement or licensing home study may serve as the adoption home study. In addition, the community-based care lead agency or its subcontracted agency must complete a preparation process, as established by department rule, with the prospective adoptive parent. (5) At the conclusion of the adoptive home study and preparation process, a decision must be made about the prospective adoptive parent’s appropriateness to adopt. This decision must be reflected in the final recommendation included in the adoptive home study. If the recommendation is for approval, the adoptive parent application file must be submitted to the community-based care lead agency or its subcontracted agency for approval. The community-based care lead agency or its subcontracted agency must approve or deny the home study within 14 business days after receipt of the recommendation. (6) The department shall adopt rules to eliminate duplicative practices and delays in the adoption home study process for a member of a uniformed service on active duty seeking to adopt in the state, including, but not limited to, providing a credit for adoption classes that have been taken in another state which substantially cover the preservice training required under s. 409.175(14)(b).

(b) Preplacement and postplacement social services. (c) Agency facility and administrative costs. (2) The following fees, costs, and expenses may be assessed by the adoption entity or paid by the adoption entity on behalf of the prospective adoptive parents: (a) Reasonable living expenses of the birth mother which the birth mother is unable to pay due to unemployment, underemployment, or disability. Reasonable living expenses are rent, utilities, basic telephone service, food, toiletries, necessary clothing, transportation, insurance, and expenses found by the court to be necessary for the health and well-being of the birth mother and the unborn child. Such expenses may be paid during the pregnancy and for a period of up to 6 weeks postpartum. (b) Reasonable and necessary medical expenses. Such expenses may be paid during the pregnancy and for a period of up to 6 weeks postpartum. (c) Expenses necessary to comply with the requirements of this chapter, including, but not limited to, service of process under s. 63.088, investigator fees, a diligent search under s. 63.088, a preliminary home study under s. 63.092, and a final home investigation under s. 63.125.

(f) The following professional fees: 1. A reasonable hourly fee or flat fee necessary to provide legal representation to the adoptive parents or adoption entity in a proceeding filed under this chapter. 2. A reasonable hourly fee or flat fee for contact with the parent related to the adoption. In determining a reasonable hourly fee under this subparagraph, the court must consider if the tasks done were clerical or of such a nature that the matter could have been handled by support staff at a lesser rate than the rate for legal representation charged under subparagraph 1. Such tasks include, but need not be limited to, transportation, transmitting funds, arranging appointments, and securing accommodations. 3. A reasonable hourly fee for counseling services provided to a parent or a prospective adoptive parent by a psychologist licensed under chapter 490 or a clinical social worker, marriage and family therapist, or mental health counselor licensed under chapter 491, or a counselor who is employed by an adoption entity accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Children and Families to provide pregnancy counseling and supportive services. (3) The court must issue an order pursuant to s. 63.132(3) if the total of amounts permitted under subsection (2) exceeds: (a) $5,000 in legal or other professional fees; (b) $800 in court costs; or (c) $5,000 in reasonable and necessary living and medical expenses. (4) Any fees, costs, or expenses not included in subsection (2) require court approval and entry of an order pursuant to s. 63.132(3) before payment and must be based on a finding of extraordinary circumstances. (5) The following fees, costs, and expenses are prohibited: (a) Any fee or expense that constitutes payment for locating a minor for adoption. (b) Any payment which is not itemized and documented on the affidavit filed under s. 63.132. (c) Any fee on the affidavit which is not a fee of the adoption entity; is not supported by a receipt; does not specify the service that was provided and for which the fee is being charged, such as a fee for facilitation, acquisition, or other similar service; or which does not identify the date the service was provided, the time required to provide the service, the person or entity providing the service, and the hourly fee charged. (6) Unless otherwise indicated in this section, when an adoption entity uses the services of a licensed child-placing agency, a professional, any other person or agency pursuant to s. 63.092, or, if necessary, the department, the person seeking to adopt the child must pay the licensed child-placing agency, professional, other person or agency, or the department an amount equal to the cost of all services performed, including, but not limited to, the cost of conducting the preliminary home study, counseling, and the final home investigation. (7) Beginning January 1, 2025, an adoption entity shall report quarterly to the department information related to the age, race, ethnicity, sex, and county of birth of the adopted child and the county of residence of the adoptive family for each finalized adoption. The adoption entity shall also report for each finalized adoption the fees, costs, and expenses that were assessed by the adoption entity or paid by the adoption entity on behalf of the prospective adoptive parents, itemized by the categories enumerated in subsection (2), and any fees, costs, and expenses approved by the court under subsection (4). The confidentiality provisions of this chapter do not apply to the fees, costs, and expenses assessed or paid in connection with an adoption. In reporting the information required by this subsection to the department, the adoption entity shall redact any confidential identifying information concerning the child, the child’s biological parents, and the child’s adoptive parents. The department shall report quarterly on its website information for each adoption entity, including the actual fees, costs, and expenses of finalized adoptions. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.

Unless directed by the court, an investigation and recommendation are not required if the petitioner is a stepparent or if the minor is related to one of the adoptive parents within the third degree of consanguinity. The department is required to perform the home investigation only if there is no licensed child-placing agency or professional pursuant to s. 63.092 in the county in which the prospective adoptive parent resides.

(b) The affidavit must itemize all disbursements and receipts of anything of value, including professional and legal fees, made or agreed to be made by or on behalf of the prospective adoptive parents and any adoption entity in connection with the adoption or in connection with any prior proceeding to terminate parental rights which involved the child who is the subject of the petition for adoption. The affidavit must also include, for each hourly legal or counseling fee itemized, the service provided for which the hourly fee is being charged, the date the service was provided, the time required to provide the service if the service was charged by the hour, the person or entity that provided the service, and the hourly fee charged. (c) The affidavit must show any expenses or receipts incurred in connection with: 1. The birth of the child. 2. The placement of the child with the petitioner. 3. The medical or hospital care received by the mother or by the child during the mother’s prenatal care and confinement. 4. The living expenses of the birth mother. The living expenses must be itemized in detail to apprise the court of the exact expenses incurred. 5. The services relating to the adoption or to the placement of the child for adoption that were received by or on behalf of the petitioner, the adoption entity, either parent, the child, or any other person. The affidavit must state whether any of these expenses were paid for by collateral sources, including, but not limited to, health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, or public assistance. (2) The court may require such additional information as is deemed necessary. (3) The court must issue a separate order approving or disapproving the fees, costs, and expenses itemized in the affidavit. The court may approve only fees, costs, and expenditures allowed under s. 63.097. An order approving fees, costs, and expenses that exceed the limits set forth in s. 63.097 must include a written determination of reasonableness. The court may reject in whole or in part any fee, cost, or expenditure listed if the court finds that the expense is any of the following: (a) Contrary to this chapter. (b) Not supported by a receipt, if the expense is not a fee of the adoption entity. (c) Not a reasonable fee or expense, considering the requirements of this chapter and the totality of the circumstances. (4) This section does not apply to an adoption by a stepparent or an adoption of a relative or adult, the finalization of an adoption of a minor if the parental rights were terminated under chapter 39, or the domestication of an adoption decree of a minor child adopted in a foreign country.

(b) It terminates all legal relationships between the adopted person and the adopted person’s relatives, including the birth parents, except a birth parent who is a petitioner or who is married to a petitioner, so that the adopted person thereafter is a stranger to his or her former relatives for all purposes, including the interpretation or construction of documents, statutes, and instruments, whether executed before or after entry of the adoption judgment, that do not expressly include the adopted person by name or by some designation not based on a parent and child or blood relationship, except that rights of inheritance shall be as provided in the Florida Probate Code. (c) Except for rights of inheritance, it creates the relationship between the adopted person and the petitioner and all relatives of the petitioner that would have existed if the adopted person were a blood descendant of the petitioner born within wedlock. This relationship shall be created for all purposes, including applicability of statutes, documents, and instruments, whether executed before or after entry of the adoption judgment, that do not expressly exclude an adopted person from their operation or effect. (2) If one or both parents of a child die without the relationship of parent and child having been previously terminated and a spouse of the living parent or a close relative of the child thereafter adopts the child, the child’s right of inheritance from or through the deceased parent is unaffected by the adoption and, unless the court orders otherwise, the adoption will not terminate any grandparental rights delineated under chapter 752.

      "text": "63.212 Prohibited acts; penalties for violation.— (1) It is unlawful for any person: (a) To place or attempt to place a minor for adoption with a person who primarily lives and works outside this state unless all of the requirements of the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, when applicable, have been met. (b) Except an adoption entity, to place or attempt to place within the state a minor for adoption unless the minor is placed with a relative or with a stepparent. This prohibition, however, does not apply to a person who is placing or attempting to place a minor for the purpose of adoption with the adoption entity. (c) To sell or surrender, or to arrange for the sale or surrender of, a child to another person for money or anything of value or to receive such child for such payment or thing of value. If a child is being adopted by a relative or by a stepparent, or is being adopted through an adoption entity, this paragraph does not prohibit the person who is contemplating adopting the child from paying, under ss. 63.097 and 63.132, the actual prenatal care and living expenses of the mother of the child to be adopted, or from paying, under ss. 63.097 and 63.132, the actual living and medical expenses of such mother for a reasonable time, not to exceed 6 weeks after the birth of the child. (d) Having the rights and duties of a parent with respect to the care and custody of a minor to assign or transfer such parental rights for the purpose of, incidental to, or otherwise connected with, selling or offering to sell such rights and duties. (e) To assist in the commission of any act prohibited in paragraphs (a)-(d). In the case of a stepparent adoption, this paragraph does not preclude the forgiveness of vested child support arrearages owed by a parent. (f) Except an adoption entity, to charge or accept any fee or compensation of any nature from anyone for making a referral in connection with an adoption. (g) Except an adoption entity, to place an advertisement or offer to the public, in any way, by any medium whatever that a minor is available for adoption or that a minor is sought for adoption; and, further, it is unlawful for any person purchasing advertising space or purchasing broadcast time to advertise adoption services to fail to include in any publication or fail to include in the broadcast for such advertisement the Florida license number of the adoption entity or The Florida Bar number of the attorney placing the advertisement. This prohibition applies, but is not limited, to a paid advertisement, an article, a notice, or any other paid communication published in any newspaper or magazine, or on the Internet, on a billboard, over radio or television, or other similar media. 1. Only a person who is an attorney licensed to practice law in this state or an adoption entity licensed under the laws of this state may place an advertisement in this state that: a. A child is offered or wanted for adoption; or b. The person is able to place, locate, or receive a child for adoption. 2. A person who publishes a telephone directory, newspaper, magazine, billboard, or any other written advertisement that is distributed in this state must include a statement that only attorneys licensed to practice law in this state and adoption entities licensed under the laws of this state may legally provide adoption services under state law. 3. A person who places an advertisement must include the following information: a. For an attorney licensed to practice law in this state, the person’s Florida Bar number. b. For a child-placing agency licensed under the laws of this state, the number on the person’s adoption entity license. (h) To contract for the purchase, sale, or transfer of custody or parental rights in connection with any child, in connection with any fetus yet unborn, or in connection with any fetus identified in any way but not yet conceived, in return for any valuable consideration. Any such contract is void and unenforceable as against the public policy of this state. However, fees, costs, and other incidental payments made in accordance with statutory provisions for adoption, foster care, and child welfare are permitted, and a person may agree to pay expenses in connection with a preplanned adoption agreement as specified in s. 63.213, but the payment of such expenses may not be conditioned upon the transfer of parental rights. Each petition for adoption which is filed in connection with a preplanned adoption agreement must clearly identify the adoption as a preplanned adoption arrangement and must include a copy of the preplanned adoption agreement for review by the court. (2) Any person who is a birth mother, or a woman who holds herself out to be a birth mother, who is interested in making an adoption plan and who knowingly or intentionally benefits from the payment of adoption-related expenses in connection with that adoption plan commits adoption deception if: (a) The person knows or should have known that the person is not pregnant at the time the sums were requested or received; (b) The person accepts living expenses assistance from a prospective adoptive parent or adoption entity without disclosing that she is receiving living expenses assistance from another prospective adoptive parent or adoption entity at the same time in an effort to adopt the same child; or (c) The person knowingly makes false representations to induce the payment of living expenses and does not intend to make an adoptive placement. Any person who willfully commits adoption deception commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, if the sums received by the birth mother or woman holding herself out to be a birth mother do not exceed $300, and a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084, if the sums received by the birth mother or woman holding herself out to be a birth mother exceed $300. In addition, the person is liable for damages caused by such acts or omissions, including reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the adoption entity or the prospective adoptive parent. Damages may be awarded through restitution in any related criminal prosecution or by filing a separate civil action. (3) This section does not prohibit an adoption entity from charging fees permitted under this chapter and reasonably commensurate to the services provided. (4) It is unlawful for any adoption entity to fail to report to the court, within a reasonable time period, the intended placement of a minor for purposes of adoption with any person not a stepparent or a relative, if the adoption entity participates in such intended placement. (5) It is unlawful for any adoption entity to charge any fee except those fees permitted under s. 63.097 and approved under s. 63.102. (6) It is unlawful for any adoption entity to counsel a birth mother to leave the state for the purpose of giving birth to a child outside the state in order to secure a fee in excess of that permitted under s. 63.097 when it is the intention that the child be placed for adoption outside the state. (7) It is unlawful for any adoption entity to obtain a preliminary home study or final home investigation and fail to disclose the existence of the study or investigation to the court when required by law to do so. (8) Unless otherwise indicated, a person who willfully and with criminal intent violates any provision of this section, excluding paragraph (1)(g), commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. A person who willfully and with criminal intent violates paragraph (1)(g) commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.083; and each day of continuing violation shall be considered a separate offense.

      "text": "63.213 Preplanned adoption agreement.— (1) Individuals may enter into a preplanned adoption arrangement as specified in this section, but such arrangement may not in any way: (a) Effect final transfer of custody of a child or final adoption of a child without review and approval of the court and without compliance with other applicable provisions of law. (b) Constitute consent of a mother to place her biological child for adoption until 48 hours after the birth of the child and unless the court making the custody determination or approving the adoption determines that the mother was aware of her right to rescind within the 48-hour period after the birth of the child but chose not to rescind such consent. The volunteer mother’s right to rescind her consent in a preplanned adoption applies only when the child is genetically related to her. (2) A preplanned adoption agreement must include, but need not be limited to, the following terms: (a) That the volunteer mother agrees to become pregnant by the fertility technique specified in the agreement, to bear the child, and to terminate any parental rights and responsibilities to the child she might have through a written consent executed at the same time as the preplanned adoption agreement, subject to a right of rescission by the volunteer mother any time within 48 hours after the birth of the child, if the volunteer mother is genetically related to the child. (b) That the volunteer mother agrees to submit to reasonable medical evaluation and treatment and to adhere to reasonable medical instructions about her prenatal health. (c) That the volunteer mother acknowledges that she is aware that she will assume parental rights and responsibilities for the child born to her as otherwise provided by law for a mother if the intended father and intended mother terminate the agreement before final transfer of custody is completed, if a court determines that a parent clearly specified by the preplanned adoption agreement to be the biological parent is not the biological parent, or if the preplanned adoption is not approved by the court pursuant to the Florida Adoption Act. (d) That an intended father who is also the biological father acknowledges that he is aware that he will assume parental rights and responsibilities for the child as otherwise provided by law for a father if the agreement is terminated for any reason by any party before final transfer of custody is completed or if the planned adoption is not approved by the court pursuant to the Florida Adoption Act. (e) That the intended father and intended mother acknowledge that they may not receive custody or the parental rights under the agreement if the volunteer mother terminates the agreement or if the volunteer mother rescinds her consent to place her child for adoption within 48 hours after the birth of the child, if the volunteer mother is genetically related to the child. (f) That the intended father and intended mother may agree to pay all reasonable legal, medical, psychological, or psychiatric expenses of the volunteer mother related to the preplanned adoption arrangement and may agree to pay the reasonable living expenses and wages lost due to the pregnancy and birth of the volunteer mother and reasonable compensation for inconvenience, discomfort, and medical risk. No other compensation, whether in cash or in kind, shall be made pursuant to a preplanned adoption arrangement. (g) That the intended father and intended mother agree to accept custody of and to assert full parental rights and responsibilities for the child immediately upon the child’s birth, regardless of any impairment to the child. (h) That the intended father and intended mother shall have the right to specify the blood and tissue typing tests to be performed if the agreement specifies that at least one of them is intended to be the biological parent of the child. (i) That the agreement may be terminated at any time by any of the parties. (3) A preplanned adoption agreement shall not contain any provision: (a) To reduce any amount paid to the volunteer mother if the child is stillborn or is born alive but impaired, or to provide for the payment of a supplement or bonus for any reason. (b) Requiring the termination of the volunteer mother’s pregnancy. (4) An attorney who represents an intended father and intended mother or any other attorney with whom that attorney is associated shall not represent simultaneously a female who is or proposes to be a volunteer mother in any matter relating to a preplanned adoption agreement or preplanned adoption arrangement. (5) Payment to agents, finders, and intermediaries, including attorneys and physicians, as a finder’s fee for finding volunteer mothers or matching a volunteer mother and intended father and intended mother is prohibited. Doctors, psychologists, attorneys, and other professionals may receive reasonable compensation for their professional services, such as providing medical services and procedures, legal advice in structuring and negotiating a preplanned adoption agreement, or counseling. (6) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Blood and tissue typing tests” include, but are not limited to, tests of red cell antigens, red cell isoenzymes, human leukocyte antigens, and serum proteins. (b) “Child” means the child or children conceived by means of a fertility technique that is part of a preplanned adoption arrangement. (c) “Fertility technique” means artificial embryonation, artificial insemination, whether in vivo or in vitro, egg donation, or embryo adoption. (d) “Intended father” means a male who, as evidenced by a preplanned adoption agreement, intends to assert the parental rights and responsibilities for a child conceived through a fertility technique, regardless of whether the child is biologically related to the male. (e) “Intended mother” means a female who, as evidenced by a preplanned adoption agreement, intends to assert the parental rights and responsibilities for a child conceived through a fertility technique, regardless of whether the child is biologically related to the female. (f) “Party” means the intended father, the intended mother, the volunteer mother, or the volunteer mother’s husband, if she has a husband. (g) “Preplanned adoption agreement” means a written agreement among the parties that specifies the intent of the parties as to their rights and responsibilities in the preplanned adoption arrangement, consistent with the provisions of this section. (h) “Preplanned adoption arrangement” means the arrangement through which the parties enter into an agreement for the volunteer mother to bear the child, for payment by the intended father and intended mother of the expenses allowed by this section, for the intended father and intended mother to assert full parental rights and responsibilities to the child if consent to adoption is not rescinded after birth by a volunteer mother who is genetically related to the child, and for the volunteer mother to terminate, subject to any right of rescission, all her parental rights and responsibilities to the child in favor of the intended father and intended mother. (i) “Volunteer mother” means a female at least 18 years of age who voluntarily agrees, subject to a right of rescission if it is her biological child, that if she should become pregnant pursuant to a preplanned adoption arrangement, she will terminate her parental rights and responsibilities to the child in favor of the intended father and intended mother.

      "text": "As used in this chapter, the term:(1)“Abandoned” means a situation in which the parent or person having legal custody of a child, while being able, makes little or no provision for the child’s support or makes little or no effort to communicate with the child, which situation is sufficient to evince an intent to reject parental responsibilities. If, in the opinion of the court, the efforts of such parent or person having legal custody of the child to support and communicate with the child are only marginal efforts that do not evince a settled purpose to assume all parental duties, the court may declare the child to be abandoned.
