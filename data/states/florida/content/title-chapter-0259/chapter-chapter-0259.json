      "text": "259.032 Conservation and recreation lands.— (1) It is the policy of the state that the citizens of this state shall be assured public ownership of natural areas for purposes of maintaining this state’s unique natural resources; protecting air, land, and water quality; promoting water resource development to meet the needs of natural systems and citizens of this state; promoting restoration activities on public lands; and providing lands for natural resource-based recreation. In recognition of this policy, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide such public lands for the people residing in urban and metropolitan areas of the state, as well as those residing in less populated, rural areas. It is the further intent of the Legislature, with regard to the lands described in paragraph (2)(c), that a high priority be given to the acquisition, restoration, and management of such lands in or near counties exhibiting the greatest concentration of population and, with regard to the lands described in subsection (2), that a high priority be given to acquiring lands or rights or interests in lands that advance the goals and objectives of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s approved species or habitat recovery plans, or lands within any area designated as an area of critical state concern under s. 380.05 which, in the judgment of the advisory council established pursuant to s. 259.035, or its successor, cannot be adequately protected by application of land development regulations adopted pursuant to s. 380.05. Finally, it is the Legislature’s intent that lands acquired for conservation and recreation purposes be managed in such a way as to protect or restore their natural resource values, and provide the greatest benefit, including public access, to the citizens of this state. (2) The Governor and Cabinet, sitting as the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, may expend moneys appropriated by the Legislature to acquire the fee or any lesser interest in lands for any of the following public purposes: (a) To conserve and protect environmentally unique and irreplaceable lands that contain native, relatively unaltered flora and fauna representing a natural area unique to, or scarce within, a region of this state or a larger geographic area; (b) To conserve and protect lands within designated areas of critical state concern, if the proposed acquisition relates to the natural resource protection purposes of the designation; (c) To conserve and protect native species habitat or endangered or threatened species, emphasizing long-term protection for endangered or threatened species designated G-1 or G-2 by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory, and especially those areas that are special locations for breeding and reproduction; (d) To conserve, protect, manage, or restore important ecosystems, landscapes, and forests, if the protection and conservation of such lands is necessary to enhance or protect significant surface water, groundwater, coastal, recreational, timber, or fish or wildlife resources which cannot otherwise be accomplished through local and state regulatory programs; (e) To promote water resource development that benefits natural systems and citizens of the state; (f) To facilitate the restoration and subsequent health and vitality of the Florida Everglades; (g) To provide areas, including recreational trails, for natural resource-based recreation and other outdoor recreation on any part of any site compatible with conservation purposes; (h) To preserve significant archaeological or historic sites; (i) To conserve urban open spaces suitable for greenways or outdoor recreation which are compatible with conservation purposes; (j) To preserve agricultural lands under threat of conversion to development through less-than-fee acquisitions; or (k) To complete critical linkages through fee or less-than-fee acquisitions that will help preserve and protect the green and blue infrastructure and vital habitat for wide-ranging wildlife, such as the Florida panther, within the Florida wildlife corridor as defined in s. 259.1055(4). (3) Lands acquired for conservation and recreation purposes shall be for use as state-designated parks, recreation areas, preserves, reserves, historic or archaeological sites, geologic or botanical sites, recreational trails, forests, wilderness areas, wildlife management areas, urban open space, or other state-designated recreation or conservation lands; or they shall qualify for such state designation and use if they are to be managed by other governmental agencies or nonstate entities as provided for in this section. (4) The board of trustees may expend funds appropriated by the Legislature for the initiation and maintenance of a natural areas inventory to aid in the identification of areas to be acquired for conservation and recreation purposes. (5) The board of trustees may enter into any contract necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section. The lead land managing agencies designated by the board of trustees also are directed by the Legislature to enter into contracts or interagency agreements with other governmental entities, including local soil and water conservation districts, or private land managers who have the expertise to perform specific management activities which a lead agency lacks, or which would cost more to provide in-house. Such activities shall include, but not be limited to, controlled burning, road and ditch maintenance, mowing, and wildlife assessments. (6) Conservation and recreation lands are subject to the selection procedures of s. 259.035 and related rules and shall be acquired in accordance with acquisition procedures for state lands provided for in s. 253.025, except as otherwise provided by the Legislature. An inholding or an addition to conservation and recreation lands is not subject to the selection procedures of s. 259.035 if the estimated value of such inholding or addition does not exceed $500,000. When at least 90 percent of the acreage of a project has been purchased for conservation and recreation purposes, the project may be removed from the list and the remaining acreage may continue to be purchased. Funds appropriated to acquire conservation and recreation lands may be used for title work, appraisal fees, environmental audits, and survey costs related to acquisition expenses for lands to be acquired, donated, or exchanged which qualify under the categories of this section, at the discretion of the board. When the Legislature has authorized the department to condemn a specific parcel of land and such parcel has already been approved for acquisition, the land may be acquired in accordance with chapter 73 or chapter 74, and the funds appropriated to acquire conservation and recreation lands may be used to pay the condemnation award and all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, associated with condemnation. (7)(a) All lands managed under this chapter and s. 253.034 must be: 1. Managed in a manner that will provide the greatest combination of benefits to the public and to the resources. 2. Managed for public outdoor recreation which is compatible with the conservation and protection of public lands. Such management may include, but not be limited to, the following public recreational uses: fishing, hunting, camping, bicycling, hiking, nature study, swimming, boating, canoeing, horseback riding, diving, model hobbyist activities, birding, sailing, jogging, and other related outdoor activities. (b) Concurrent with its adoption of the annual list of acquisition projects pursuant to s. 259.035, the board shall adopt a management prospectus for each project. The management prospectus shall delineate: 1. The management goals for the property; 2. The conditions that will affect the intensity of management; 3. An estimate of the revenue-generating potential of the property, if appropriate; 4. A timetable for implementing the various stages of management and for providing access to the public, if applicable; 5. A description of potential multiple-use activities as described in this section and s. 253.034; 6. Provisions for protecting existing infrastructure and for ensuring the security of the project upon acquisition; 7. The anticipated costs of management and projected sources of revenue, including legislative appropriations, to fund management needs; and 8. Recommendations as to how many employees will be needed to manage the property, and recommendations as to whether local governments, volunteer groups, the former landowner, or other interested parties can be involved in the management. (c) Concurrent with the approval of the acquisition contract pursuant to s. 253.025(4) for any interest in lands except those lands acquired pursuant to s. 259.1052, the board shall designate an agency or agencies to manage such lands. The board shall evaluate and amend, as appropriate, the management policy statement for the project as provided by s. 259.035 to ensure that the policy statement is compatible with conservation, recreation, or both. For any fee simple acquisition of a parcel which is or will be leased back for agricultural purposes, or any acquisition of a less than fee interest in land that is or will be used for agricultural purposes, the board shall first consider having a soil and water conservation district, created pursuant to chapter 582, manage and monitor such interests. (d) State agencies designated to manage lands acquired under this chapter or with funds deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund, except those lands acquired under s. 259.1052, may contract with local governments, water control districts designated pursuant to chapter 298, and soil and water conservation districts to assist in management activities, including the responsibility of being the lead land manager. Such land management contracts must include a provision for the transfer of management funding to the local government, water control district, or soil and water conservation district of the lead land managing agency in an amount adequate for the local government, water control district, or soil and water conservation district to perform its land management responsibilities or which otherwise would have been expended by the state agency to manage the property. (e) Immediately following the acquisition of any interest in conservation and recreation lands, the department, acting on behalf of the board, may issue to the lead managing entity an interim assignment letter to be effective until the execution of a formal lease. (8)(a) State, regional, or local governmental agencies or private entities designated to manage lands under this section shall develop and adopt, with the approval of the board, an individual management plan for each project designed to conserve and protect such lands and their associated natural resources. Private sector involvement in management plan development may be used to expedite the planning process. (b) Individual management plans required by s. 253.034(5) for parcels over 160 acres and for parcels located within a state park must be developed with input from an advisory group. 1. Members of the advisory group shall include, at a minimum, representatives of the lead land managing agency, comanaging entities, local private property owners, the appropriate soil and water conservation district, a local conservation organization, and a local elected official. If habitat or potentially restorable habitat for imperiled species is located on state lands, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services must be included on any advisory group required under chapter 253, and the short-term and long-term management goals required under chapter 253 must advance the goals and objectives of imperiled species management without restricting other uses identified in the management plan. 2. The advisory group shall conduct at least one public hearing within the county in which the parcel or project is located. For those parcels or projects within more than one county, at least one areawide public hearing is acceptable and the lead managing agency shall invite a local elected official from each county. The areawide public hearing must be held in the county in which the core parcels are located. At least 30 days before the public hearing, notice of the hearing must be posted on the parcel or project designated for management, advertised in a paper of general circulation, and announced at a scheduled meeting of the local governing body. 3. The management prospectus required pursuant to paragraph (7)(b) must be available to the public for a period of 30 days before the public hearing. (c) Once a plan is adopted, the managing agency or entity shall update the plan at least every 10 years in a form and manner adopted by rule of the board. Such updates for parcels over 160 acres and for parcels located within a state park must be developed with input from an advisory group. Such plans may include transfers of leasehold interests to appropriate conservation organizations or governmental entities designated by the council for uses consistent with the purposes of the organizations and the protection, preservation, conservation, restoration, and proper management of the lands and their resources. Volunteer management assistance is encouraged, including, but not limited to, assistance by youths participating in programs sponsored by state or local agencies, by volunteers sponsored by environmental or civic organizations, and by individuals participating in programs for committed delinquents and adults. (d) For each project for which lands are acquired after July 1, 1995, an individual management plan shall be adopted and in place no later than 1 year after the essential parcel or parcels identified in the priority list developed pursuant to s. 259.105 have been acquired. The department shall distribute only 75 percent of the acquisition funds to which a budget entity or water management district would otherwise be entitled to any budget entity or any water management district that has more than one-third of its management plans overdue. (e) Individual management plans shall conform to the appropriate policies and guidelines of the state land management plan and shall include, but not be limited to: 1. A statement of the purpose for which the lands were acquired, the projected use or uses as defined in s. 253.034, and the statutory authority for such use or uses. 2. Key management activities necessary to achieve the desired outcomes, including, but not limited to, providing public access, preserving and protecting natural resources, protecting cultural and historical resources, restoring habitat, protecting threatened and endangered species, controlling the spread of nonnative plants and animals, performing prescribed fire activities, and other appropriate resource management. 3. A specific description of how the managing agency plans to identify, locate, protect, and preserve, or otherwise use fragile, nonrenewable natural and cultural resources. 4. A priority schedule for conducting management activities. 5. A cost estimate for conducting priority management activities, to include recommendations for cost-effective methods of accomplishing those activities. 6. A cost estimate for conducting other management activities which would enhance the natural resource value or public recreation value. The cost estimate shall include recommendations for cost-effective methods of accomplishing those activities. 7. A determination of the public uses and public access that would be compatible with conservation, recreation, or both. (f) The Division of State Lands shall submit a copy of each individual management plan for parcels which exceed 160 acres in size to each member of the council, which shall: 1. Within 60 days after receiving a plan from the Division of State Lands, review each plan for compliance with the requirements of this subsection and with the requirements of the rules adopted by the board pursuant to this subsection. 2. Consider the propriety of the recommendations of the managing agency with regard to the future use or protection of the property. 3. After its review, submit the plan, along with its recommendations and comments, to the board, with recommendations as to whether to approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan with modifications, or reject the plan. (g) The board shall consider the individual management plan submitted by each state agency and the recommendations of the council and the department and shall approve the plan with or without modification or reject such plan. The use or possession of any lands owned by the board which is not in accordance with an approved individual management plan is subject to termination by the board. By July 1 of each year, each governmental agency and each private entity designated to manage lands shall report to the Secretary of Environmental Protection on the progress of funding, staffing, and resource management of every project for which the agency or entity is responsible. (9)(a) The Legislature recognizes that acquiring lands pursuant to this chapter serves the public interest by protecting land, air, and water resources which contribute to the public health and welfare, providing areas for natural resource-based recreation, and ensuring the survival of unique and irreplaceable plant and animal species. The Legislature intends for these lands to be managed and maintained in a manner that is compatible with conservation, recreation, or both, consistent with the land management plan and for the public to have access to and use of these lands if public access would not harm the resources the state is seeking to protect on the public’s behalf. (b) An amount of not less than 1.5 percent of the cumulative total of funds ever deposited into the former Florida Preservation 2000 Trust Fund and the Florida Forever Trust Fund shall be made available for the purposes of management, maintenance, and capital improvements, and for associated contractual services, for conservation and recreation lands acquired with funds deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund pursuant to s. 28(a), Art. X of the State Constitution or pursuant to former s. 259.032, Florida Statutes 2014, former s. 259.101, Florida Statutes 2014, s. 259.105, s. 259.1052, or previous programs for the acquisition of lands for conservation and recreation, including state forests, to which title is vested in the board of trustees and other conservation and recreation lands managed by a state agency. Each agency with management responsibilities shall annually request from the Legislature funds sufficient to fulfill such responsibilities to implement individual management plans. For the purposes of this paragraph, capital improvements shall include, but need not be limited to, perimeter fencing, signs, firelanes, access roads and trails, and minimal public accommodations, such as primitive campsites, garbage receptacles, and toilets. Any equipment purchased with funds provided pursuant to this paragraph may be used for the purposes described in this paragraph on any conservation and recreation lands managed by a state agency. The funding requirement created in this paragraph is subject to an annual evaluation by the Legislature to ensure that such requirement does not impact the respective trust fund in a manner that would prevent the trust fund from meeting other minimum requirements. (c) All revenues generated through multiple-use management or compatible secondary-use management shall be returned to the lead agency responsible for such management and shall be used to pay for management activities on all conservation, preservation, and recreation lands under the agency’s jurisdiction. In addition, such revenues shall be segregated in an agency trust fund used for land management activities, other than a land acquisition trust fund, and such revenues shall remain available to the agency in subsequent fiscal years to support land management appropriations. For the purposes of this paragraph, compatible secondary-use management shall be those activities described in subsection (7) undertaken on parcels designated as single use pursuant to s. 253.034(2)(b). (d) Up to one-fifth of the funds appropriated for the purposes identified in paragraph (b) shall be reserved by the board for interim management of acquisitions and for associated contractual services, to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources on project sites and to allow limited public recreational use of lands. Interim management activities may include, but not be limited to, resource assessments, control of invasive, nonnative species, habitat restoration, fencing, law enforcement, controlled burning, and public access consistent with preliminary determinations made pursuant to paragraph (7)(e). The board shall make these interim funds available immediately upon purchase. (e) The department shall set long-range and annual goals for the control and removal of nonnative, invasive plant species on public lands. Such goals shall differentiate between aquatic plant species and upland plant species. In setting such goals, the department may rank, in order of adverse impact, species that impede or destroy the functioning of natural systems. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), up to one-fourth of the funds provided for in paragraph (b) may be used by the agencies receiving those funds for control and removal of nonnative, invasive species on public lands. (f) To ensure that the public has knowledge of and access to conservation lands, as defined in s. 253.034(2)(c), the department shall publish, update, and maintain a database of such lands where public access is compatible with conservation and recreation purposes. 1. By July 1, 2017, the database must be available to the public online and must include, at a minimum, the location, types of allowable recreational opportunities, points of public access, facilities or other amenities, restrictions, and any other information the department deems appropriate to increase public awareness of recreational opportunities on conservation lands. Such data must be electronically accessible, searchable, and downloadable in a generally acceptable format. 2. The department, through its own efforts or through partnership with a third-party entity, shall create an application downloadable on mobile devices to be used to locate state lands available for public access using the user’s locational information or based upon an activity of interest. 3. The database and application must include information for all state conservation lands to which the public has a right of access for recreational purposes. Beginning January 1, 2018, to the greatest extent practicable, the database shall include similar information for lands owned by federal and local governmental entities that allow access for recreational purposes. 4. By January 1 of each year, the department shall provide a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives describing the percentage of public lands acquired under this chapter to which the public has access and the efforts undertaken by the department to increase public access to such lands. (10)(a) Beginning July 1, 1999, the Legislature may appropriate funds annually to the department for payment in lieu of taxes to qualifying counties and local governments as defined in paragraph (b) for all actual tax losses incurred as a result of board of trustees acquisitions for state agencies under the Florida Forever program or the former Florida Preservation 2000 program. (b) Payment in lieu of taxes shall be available: 1. To all counties that have a population of 150,000 or fewer. Population levels shall be determined pursuant to s. 11.031. 2. To all local governments located in eligible counties. (c) If insufficient funds are available in any year to make full payments to all qualifying counties and local governments, such counties and local governments shall receive a pro rata share of the moneys available. (d) The payment amount shall be based on the average amount of actual taxes paid on the property for the 3 years preceding acquisition. Applications for payment in lieu of taxes shall be made no later than January 31 of the year following acquisition. No payment in lieu of taxes shall be made for properties which were exempt from ad valorem taxation for the year immediately preceding acquisition. (e) If property which was subject to ad valorem taxation was acquired by a tax-exempt entity for ultimate conveyance to the state under this chapter, payment in lieu of taxes shall be made for such property based upon the average amount of taxes paid on the property for the 3 years before its being removed from the tax rolls. The department shall certify to the Department of Revenue those properties that may be eligible under this provision. Once eligibility has been established, that county or local government shall receive annual payments for each tax loss until the qualifying county or local government exceeds the population threshold pursuant to this section. (f) Payment in lieu of taxes pursuant to this subsection shall be made annually to qualifying counties and local governments after certification by the Department of Revenue that the amounts applied for are reasonably appropriate, based on the amount of actual taxes paid on the eligible property. With the assistance of the local government requesting payment in lieu of taxes, the state agency that acquired the land is responsible for preparing and submitting application requests for payment to the Department of Revenue for certification. (g) If the board of trustees conveys to a local government title to any land owned by the board, any payments in lieu of taxes on the land made to the local government shall be discontinued as of the date of the conveyance. For the purposes of this subsection, “local government” includes municipalities, the county school board, mosquito control districts, and any other local government entity which levies ad valorem taxes, with the exception of a water management district. (11) Within 90 days after receiving a certified letter from the owner of a property on the priority list established pursuant to s. 259.105 objecting to the property being included in an acquisition project, where such property is a project or part of a project which has not been listed for purchase in the current year’s land acquisition work plan, the board of trustees shall delete the property from the list or from the boundary of an acquisition project on the list.

(b) The department shall act as the review team coordinator for the purposes of establishing schedules for the reviews and other staff functions. The Legislature shall appropriate funds necessary to implement land management review team functions. (2) The land management review team shall review select management areas before the date the manager is required to submit a 10-year land management plan update. For management areas that exceed 1,000 acres in size, the department shall schedule a land management review at least every 5 years. A copy of the review shall be provided to the manager, the department, and the council. The manager shall consider the findings and recommendations of the land management review team in finalizing the required 10-year update of its management plan. (3) In conducting a review, the land management review team shall evaluate the extent to which the existing management plan provides sufficient protection to threatened or endangered species, unique or important natural or physical features, geological or hydrological functions, or archaeological features. The review shall also evaluate the extent to which the land is being managed for the purposes for which it was acquired and the degree to which actual management practices, including public access, are in compliance with the adopted management plan. (4) In the event a land management plan has not been adopted within the timeframes specified in s. 259.032(8), the department may direct a management review of the property, to be conducted by the land management review team. The review shall consider the extent to which the land is being managed in a manner that is compatible with conservation, recreation, or both and the degree to which actual management practices are in compliance with the management policy statement and management prospectus for that property. (5) If the land management review team determines that reviewed lands are not being managed in a manner that is compatible with conservation, recreation, or both, consistent with the adopted land management plan, management policy statement, or management prospectus, or if the managing agency fails to address the review findings in the updated management plan, the department shall provide the review findings to the board, and the managing agency must report to the board its reasons for managing the lands as it has. (6) No later than the second board meeting in October of each year, the department shall report the annual review findings of its land management review team.

Each state agency represented on the LMUAC shall have one vote. The chair of the LMUAC shall rotate annually in the foregoing order of state agencies. The agency of the representative serving as chair shall provide staff support for the LMUAC. The Division of State Lands shall serve as the recipient of and repository for the LMUAC’s documents. The LMUAC shall meet at the request of the chair. (2) The Auditor General and the director of the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, or their designees, shall advise the LMUAC to ensure that appropriate accounting procedures are used and that a uniform method of collecting and reporting accurate costs of land management activities are created and can be used by all agencies. (3)(a) All land management activities and costs must be assigned to a specific category, and any single activity or cost may not be assigned to more than one category. Administrative costs, such as planning or training, shall be segregated from other management activities. Specific management activities and costs must initially be grouped, at a minimum, within the following categories: 1. Resource management. 2. Administration. 3. Support. 4. Capital improvements. 5. Recreation visitor services. 6. Law enforcement activities. Upon adoption of the initial list of land management categories by the LMUAC, agencies assigned to manage conservation or recreation lands shall account for land management costs in accordance with the category to which an expenditure is assigned. (b) Each reporting agency shall also: 1. Include a report of the available public use opportunities for each management unit of state land, the total management cost for public access and public use, and the cost associated with each use option. 2. List the acres of land requiring minimal management effort, moderate management effort, and significant management effort. For each category created in paragraph (a), the reporting agency shall include the amount of funds requested, the amount of funds received, and the amount of funds expended for land management. 3. List acres managed and cost of management for each park, preserve, forest, reserve, or management area. 4. List acres managed, cost of management, and lead manager for each state lands management unit for which secondary management activities were provided. 5. Include a report of the estimated calculable financial benefits to the public for the ecosystem services provided by conservation lands, based on the best readily available information or science that provides a standard measurement methodology to be consistently applied by the land managing agencies. Such information may include, but need not be limited to, the value of natural lands for protecting the quality and quantity of drinking water through natural water filtration and recharge, contributions to protecting and improving air quality, benefits to agriculture through increased soil productivity and preservation of biodiversity, and savings to property and lives through flood control. (4) The LMUAC shall provide a report of the agencies’ expenditures pursuant to the adopted categories to the Acquisition and Restoration Council and the Division of State Lands for inclusion in its annual report required pursuant to s. 259.036. (5) Should the LMUAC determine that the list of land management categories needs to be revised, it shall meet upon the call of the chair. (6) Biennially, each reporting agency shall also submit an operational report for each management area along with an approved management plan. The report should assess the progress toward achieving short-term and long-term management goals of the approved management plan, including all land management activities, and identify any deficiencies in management and corrective actions to address identified deficiencies as appropriate. This report shall be submitted to the Acquisition and Restoration Council and the Division of State Lands for inclusion in its annual report required pursuant to s. 259.036. (7)(a) The LMUAC shall recommend the most efficient and effective use of the funds available to state agencies for land management activities. The recommendations must be based on a review of the resources of each land management agency to determine current expenditures, including personnel costs, spent specifically on upland management activities and invasive species removal. The recommendations must include a calculation methodology to distribute the funds between state agencies. (b) The LMUAC shall adopt its initial recommendation and submit it to the Executive Office of the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by January 3, 2027. Thereafter, the LMUAC shall update its recommendation in the biennial report developed pursuant to this section.

      "text": "259.042 Tax increment financing for conservation lands.— (1) Two or more counties, or a combination of at least one county and one or more municipalities, may establish, through an interlocal agreement, a tax increment area for conservation lands. The interlocal agreement, at a minimum, must: (a) Identify the geographic boundaries of the tax increment area; (b) Identify the real property to be acquired as conservation land within the tax increment area; (c) Establish the percentage of tax increment financing for each jurisdiction in the tax increment area which is a party to the interlocal agreement; (d) Identify the governing body of the jurisdiction that will administer a separate reserve account in which the tax increment will be deposited; (e) Require that any tax increment revenues not used to purchase conservation lands by a date certain be refunded to the parties to the interlocal agreement. Any refund shall be proportionate to the parties’ payment of tax increment revenues into the separate reserve account; (f) Provide for an annual audit of the separate reserve account; (g) Designate an entity to hold title to any conservation lands purchased using the tax increment revenues; (h) Provide for a continuing management plan for the conservation lands; and (i) Identify the entity that will manage these conservation lands. (2) The water management district in which conservation lands proposed for purchase under this section are located may also enter into the interlocal agreement if the district provides any funds for the purchase of the conservation lands. The water management districts may only use ad valorem tax revenues for agreements described within this section. (3) The governing body of the jurisdiction that will administer the separate reserve account shall provide documentation to the Department of Commerce identifying the boundary of the tax increment area. The department shall determine whether the boundary is appropriate in that property owners within the boundary will receive a benefit from the proposed purchase of identified conservation lands. The department must issue a letter of approval stating that the establishment of the tax increment area and the proposed purchases would benefit property owners within the boundary and serve a public purpose before any tax increment funds are deposited into the separate reserve account. If the department fails to provide the required letter within 90 days after receiving sufficient documentation of the boundary, the establishment of the area and the proposed purchases are deemed to provide such benefit and serve a public purpose. (4) Prior to the purchase of conservation lands under this section, the Department of Environmental Protection must determine whether the proposed purchase is sufficient to provide additional recreational and ecotourism opportunities for residents in the tax increment area. If the department fails to provide a letter of approval within 90 days after receipt of the request for such a letter, the purchase is deemed sufficient to provide recreation and ecotourism opportunities. (5) The tax increment authorized under this section shall be determined annually and may not exceed 95 percent of the difference in ad valorem taxes as provided in s. 163.387(1)(a). (6) A separate reserve account must be established for each tax increment area for conservation lands which is created under this section. The separate reserve account must be administered pursuant to the terms of the interlocal agreement. Tax increment funds allocated to this separate reserve account shall be used to acquire the real property identified for purchase in the interlocal agreement. Pursuant to the interlocal agreement, the governing body of the local government that will administer the separate reserve account may spend increment revenues to purchase the real property only if all parties to the interlocal agreement adopt a resolution approving the purchase price. (7) The annual funding of the separate reserve account may not be less than the increment income of each taxing authority which is held as provided in the interlocal agreement for the purchase of conservation lands. (8) Unless otherwise provided in the interlocal agreement, a taxing authority that does not pay the tax increment revenues to the separate reserve account by January 1 shall pay interest on the amount of unpaid increment revenues equal to 1 percent for each month that the increment revenue remains outstanding. (9) The public bodies and taxing authorities listed in s. 163.387(2)(c), school districts, and special districts that levy ad valorem taxes within a tax increment area are exempt from this section. (10) Revenue bonds under this section are payable solely out of revenues pledged to and received by the local government administering the separate reserve account and deposited into the separate reserve account. The revenue bonds issued under this section do not constitute a debt, liability, or obligation of a public body, the state, or any of the state’s political subdivisions.

      "text": "259.101 Florida Preservation 2000 Act.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Florida Preservation 2000 Act.” (2) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds and declares that: (a) The alteration and development of Florida’s natural areas to accommodate its rapidly growing population have contributed to the degradation of water resources, the fragmentation and destruction of wildlife habitats, the loss of recreation space, and the diminishment of wetlands and forests. (b) Imminent development of Florida’s remaining natural areas and continuing increases in land values necessitate an aggressive program of public land acquisition during the next decade to preserve the quality of life that attracts so many people to Florida. (c) Acquisition of public lands, in fee simple or in any lesser interest, should be based on a comprehensive assessment of Florida’s natural resources and planned so as to protect the integrity of ecological systems and to provide multiple benefits, including preservation of fish and wildlife habitat, recreation space, and water recharge areas. Governmental agencies responsible for public land acquisition should work together to purchase lands jointly and to coordinate individual purchases within ecological systems. (d) One of the purposes of the Florida Communities Trust program is to acquire, protect, and preserve open space and recreation properties within urban areas where pristine animal and plant communities no longer exist. These areas are often overlooked in other programs because of their smaller size and proximity to developed property. These smaller parcels are, however, critically important to the quality of life in these urban areas for the residents who live there as well as to the many visitors to the state. The trust shall consider projects submitted by local governments which further the goals, objectives, and policies of the conservation, recreation and open space, or coastal elements of their local comprehensive plans or which serve to conserve natural resources or resolve land use conflicts. (e) South Florida’s water supply and unique natural environment depend on the protection of lands buffering the East Everglades and the Everglades water conservation areas. In addition, the Legislature recognizes the conflicting desires of the citizens of this state to prosper through economic development and to preserve the natural areas of Florida that development threatens to claim. The Legislature further recognizes the urgency of acquiring natural areas in the state for preservation, yet acknowledges the difficulty of ensuring adequate funding for accelerated acquisition in light of other equally critical financial needs of the state. (3) TITLE TO CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED WITH PRESERVATION 2000 BONDS.—Title to lands purchased pursuant to former paragraphs (a), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this subsection, Florida Statutes 2014, shall be vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. Title to lands purchased pursuant to former paragraph (c) of this subsection, Florida Statutes 2014, may be vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The board of trustees shall hold title to land protection agreements and conservation easements that were acquired pursuant to former s. 380.0677, Florida Statutes 2014, and the Southwest Florida Water Management District and the St. Johns River Water Management District shall monitor such agreements and easements within their respective districts until the state assumes this responsibility. (4) FLORIDA FOREST SERVICE FUND USE.—All deeds or leases with respect to any real property acquired with Preservation 2000 funds received by the Florida Forest Service must contain sufficient covenants and restrictions to ensure that the use of such real property complies with s. 375.051 and s. 9, Art. XII of the State Constitution and reverter clauses providing for the reversion of title to such property to the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund or, in the case of a lease of such property, providing for termination of the lease upon a failure to use the property conveyed thereby for such purposes. (5) DISPOSITION OF LANDS.— (a) Any lands acquired pursuant to former paragraphs (3)(a), (3)(c), (3)(d), (3)(e), (3)(f), or (3)(g) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, if title to such lands is vested in the board, may be disposed of by the board in accordance with the provisions and procedures set forth in s. 253.0341, and lands acquired pursuant to former paragraph (3)(b) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, may be disposed of by the owning water management district in accordance with the procedures and provisions set forth in ss. 373.056 and 373.089 provided such disposition also shall satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c). (b) Before land acquired with Preservation 2000 funds may be surplused as required by s. 253.0341 or determined to be no longer required for its purposes under s. 373.056(4), as applicable, there shall first be a determination by the board, or, in the case of water management district lands, by the owning water management district, that such land no longer needs to be preserved in furtherance of the intent of the Florida Preservation 2000 Act. Any lands eligible to be disposed of under this procedure also may be used to acquire other lands through an exchange of lands if such lands obtained in an exchange are described in the same paragraph of former subsection (3) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, as the lands disposed. (c) Revenue derived from the disposal of lands acquired with Preservation 2000 funds may not be used for any purpose except for deposit into the Florida Forever Trust Fund within the department, for recredit to the share held under former subsection (3) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, in which such disposed land is described. (6) ALTERNATE USES OF ACQUIRED LANDS.— (a) The board, or, in the case of water management district lands, the owning water management district, may authorize the granting of a lease, easement, or license for the use of any lands acquired pursuant to former subsection (3) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, for any governmental use permitted by s. 17, Art. IX of the State Constitution of 1885, as adopted by s. 9(a), Art. XII of the State Constitution, and any other incidental public or private use that is determined by the board or the owning water management district to be compatible with conservation, preservation, or recreation purposes. (b) Any existing lease, easement, or license acquired for incidental public or private use on, under, or across any lands acquired pursuant to former subsection (3) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, shall be presumed not to be incompatible with the purposes for which such lands were acquired. (7) PUBLIC RECREATIONAL USE.—An agency or water management district that acquired lands using Preservation 2000 funds distributed pursuant to former subsection (3) of this section, Florida Statutes 2014, shall manage such lands to make them available for public recreational use if the recreational use does not interfere with the protection of natural resource values. The agency or district may enter into an agreement with the department or another appropriate state agency to transfer management authority or lease to such agencies’ lands purchased with Preservation 2000 funds for the purpose of managing the lands to make them available for public recreational use. The water management districts and the department shall take action to control the growth of nonnative invasive plant species on lands they manage which were purchased with Preservation 2000 funds.

      "heading": "The Florida Forever Act.",
      "text": "259.105 The Florida Forever Act.— (1) This section may be cited as the “Florida Forever Act.” (2)(a) The Legislature finds and declares that: 1. Land acquisition programs have provided tremendous financial resources for purchasing environmentally significant lands to protect those lands from imminent development or alteration, thereby ensuring present and future generations’ access to important waterways, open spaces, and recreation and conservation lands. 2. The continued alteration and development of the state’s natural and rural areas to accommodate the state’s growing population have contributed to the degradation of water resources, the fragmentation and destruction of wildlife habitats, the loss of outdoor recreation space, and the diminishment of wetlands, forests, working landscapes, and coastal open space. 3. The potential development of the state’s remaining natural areas and escalation of land values require government efforts to restore, bring under public protection, or acquire lands and water areas to preserve the state’s essential ecological functions and invaluable quality of life. 4. It is essential to protect the state’s ecosystems by promoting a more efficient use of land, to ensure opportunities for viable agricultural activities on working lands, and to promote vital rural and urban communities that support and produce development patterns consistent with natural resource protection. 5. The state’s groundwater, surface waters, and springs are under tremendous pressure due to population growth and economic expansion and require special protection and restoration efforts, including the protection of uplands and springsheds that provide vital recharge to aquifer systems and are critical to the protection of water quality and water quantity of the aquifers and springs. To ensure that sufficient quantities of water are available to meet the current and future needs of the natural systems and citizens of the state, and assist in achieving the planning goals of the department and the water management districts, water resource development projects on public lands, if compatible with the resource values of and management objectives for the lands, are appropriate. 6. The needs of urban, suburban, and small communities in the state for high-quality outdoor recreational opportunities, greenways, trails, and open space have not been fully met by previous acquisition programs. Through such programs as the Florida Communities Trust and the Florida Recreation Development Assistance Program, the state shall place additional emphasis on acquiring, protecting, preserving, and restoring open space, ecological greenways, and recreation properties within urban, suburban, and rural areas where pristine natural communities or water bodies no longer exist because of the proximity of developed property. 7. Many of the state’s unique ecosystems, such as the Florida Everglades, are facing ecological collapse due to the state’s burgeoning population growth and other economic activities. To preserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations, essential parcels of land must be acquired to facilitate ecosystem restoration. 8. Access to public lands to support a broad range of outdoor recreational opportunities and the development of necessary infrastructure, if compatible with the resource values of and management objectives for such lands, promotes an appreciation for the state’s natural assets and improves the quality of life. 9. Acquisition of lands, in fee simple, less than fee interest, or other techniques shall be based on a comprehensive science-based assessment of the state’s natural resources which targets essential conservation lands by prioritizing all current and future acquisitions based on a uniform set of data and planned so as to protect the integrity and function of ecological systems and working landscapes, and provide multiple benefits, including preservation of fish and wildlife habitat, recreation space for urban and rural areas, and the restoration of natural water storage, flow, and recharge. 10. The state has embraced performance-based program budgeting as a tool to evaluate the achievements of publicly funded agencies, build in accountability, and reward those agencies which are able to consistently achieve quantifiable goals. While previous and existing state environmental programs have achieved varying degrees of success, few of these programs can be evaluated as to the extent of their achievements, primarily because performance measures, standards, outcomes, and goals were not established at the outset. Therefore, the Florida Forever program shall be developed and implemented in the context of measurable state goals and objectives. 11.a. The state must play a major role in the recovery and management of its imperiled species through the acquisition, restoration, enhancement, and management of ecosystems that can support the major life functions of such species. It is the intent of the Legislature to support local, state, and federal programs that result in net benefit to imperiled species habitat by providing public and private land owners meaningful incentives for acquiring, restoring, managing, and repopulating habitats for imperiled species. It is the further intent of the Legislature that public lands, both existing and to be acquired, identified by the lead land managing agency, in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for animals or the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for plants, as habitat or potentially restorable habitat for imperiled species, be restored, enhanced, managed, and repopulated as habitat for such species to advance the goals and objectives of imperiled species management for conservation, recreation, or both, consistent with the land management plan without restricting other uses identified in the management plan. It is also the intent of the Legislature that of the proceeds distributed pursuant to subsection (3), additional consideration be given to acquisitions that achieve a combination of conservation goals, including the restoration, enhancement, management, or repopulation of habitat for imperiled species. The council, in addition to the criteria in subsection (9), shall give weight to projects that include acquisition, restoration, management, or repopulation of habitat for imperiled species. The term “imperiled species” as used in this chapter and chapter 253, means plants and animals that are federally listed under the Endangered Species Act, or state-listed by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. As part of the state’s role, all state lands that have imperiled species habitat shall include as a consideration in management plan development the restoration, enhancement, management, and repopulation of such habitats. In addition, the lead land managing agency of such state lands may use fees received from public or private entities for projects to offset adverse impacts to imperiled species or their habitat in order to restore, enhance, manage, repopulate, or acquire land and to implement land management plans developed under s. 253.034 or a land management prospectus developed and implemented under this chapter. Such fees shall be deposited into a foundation or fund created by each land management agency under s. 379.223, s. 589.012, or s. 259.032(9)(c), to be used solely to restore, manage, enhance, repopulate, or acquire imperiled species habitat. b. The Legislature recognizes that there have been geographical and capacity constraints on available gopher tortoise recipient sites that have coincided with increased demands for such sites. The Legislature also recognizes that the success of gopher tortoise conservation depends on participation by privately owned lands and the use of appropriate public lands for gopher tortoise and other imperiled species management and recovery. To encourage adequate capacity for relocating gopher tortoises, each lead land managing agency, in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, shall consider the feasibility of using a portion of state lands as a gopher tortoise recipient site in management plans for all state lands under the management of the agency that are greater than 40 contiguous acres. If the lead land managing agency, in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, determines that gopher tortoise recipient site management does not conflict with the primary management objectives of the lands, the management plan must contain a component prepared by the agency or cooperatively with a Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission wildlife biologist that assesses the feasibility of managing the lands as a recipient site for gopher tortoises consistent with rules of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The feasibility assessment by the lead land managing agency must also evaluate the economic feasibility of establishing a gopher tortoise recipient site, including the initial cost and recurring management costs of operating the gopher tortoise recipient site consistent with the rules of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the revenue projections necessary to ensure the initial and recurring costs of establishing and perpetually maintaining the gopher tortoise recipient site do not create an increased recurring expense for the agency. 12. There is a need to change the focus and direction of the state’s major land acquisition programs and to extend funding and bonding capabilities, so that future generations may enjoy the natural resources of this state. (b) The Legislature recognizes that acquisition of lands in fee simple is only one way to achieve the aforementioned goals and encourages the use of less-than-fee interests, other techniques, and the development of creative partnerships between governmental agencies and private landowners. Such partnerships may include those that advance the restoration, enhancement, management, or repopulation of imperiled species habitat on state lands as provided for in subparagraph (a)11. Easements acquired pursuant to s. 570.71(2)(a) and (b), land protection agreements, and nonstate funded tools such as rural land stewardship areas, sector planning, gopher tortoise recipient sites, and mitigation should be used, where appropriate, to bring environmentally sensitive tracts under an acceptable level of protection at a lower financial cost to the public, and to provide private landowners with the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from their property. The owner of lands where a conservation easement or other less-than-fee interest has been acquired by the board or another state agency or a regional or local government may establish a recipient site or conservation bank on the lands to advance the restoration, enhancement, management, or repopulation of imperiled species habitat so long as the recipient site or operation and maintenance of the conservation bank does not interfere with the management plan for the conservation easement and the landowner complies with all state and federal permitting requirements for the recipient site or conservation bank. (c) Public agencies or other entities that receive funds under this section shall coordinate their expenditures so that project acquisitions, when combined with acquisitions under Florida Forever, Preservation 2000, Save Our Rivers, the Florida Communities Trust, other public land acquisition programs, and the techniques, partnerships, and tools referenced in subparagraph (a)11. and paragraph (b), are used to form more complete patterns of protection for natural areas, ecological greenways, and functioning ecosystems, to better accomplish the intent of this section. (d) A long-term financial commitment to restoring, enhancing, and managing Florida’s public lands in order to implement land management plans developed under s. 253.034 or a land management prospectus developed and implemented under this chapter must accompany any land acquisition program to ensure that the natural resource values of such lands are restored, enhanced, managed, and protected; that the public enjoys the lands to their fullest potential; and that the state achieves the full benefits of its investment of public dollars. Innovative strategies such as public-private partnerships and interagency planning and sharing of resources shall be used to achieve the state’s management goals. (e) With limited dollars available for restoration, enhancement, management, and acquisition of land and water areas and for providing long-term management and capital improvements, a competitive selection process shall select those projects best able to meet the goals of Florida Forever and maximize the efficient use of the program’s funding. (f) To ensure success and provide accountability to the citizens of this state, it is the intent of the Legislature that any cash or bond proceeds used pursuant to this section be used to implement the goals and objectives recommended by a comprehensive science-based assessment and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and the Legislature. (g) As it has with previous land acquisition programs, the Legislature recognizes the desires of the residents of this state to prosper through economic development and to preserve, restore, and manage the state’s natural areas and recreational open space. The Legislature further recognizes the urgency of restoring the natural functions, including wildlife and imperiled species habitat functions, of public lands or water bodies before they are degraded to a point where recovery may never occur, yet acknowledges the difficulty of ensuring adequate funding for restoration, enhancement, and management efforts in light of other equally critical financial needs of the state. It is the Legislature’s desire and intent to fund the implementation of this section and to do so in a fiscally responsible manner, by issuing bonds to be repaid with documentary stamp tax or other revenue sources, including those identified in subparagraph (a)11. (h) The Legislature further recognizes the important role that many of our state and federal military installations contribute to protecting and preserving Florida’s natural resources as well as our economic prosperity. Where the state’s land conservation plans overlap with the military’s need to protect lands, waters, and habitat to ensure the sustainability of military missions, it is the Legislature’s intent that agencies receiving funds under this program cooperate with our military partners to protect and buffer military installations and military airspace, by: 1. Protecting habitat on nonmilitary land for any species found on military land that is designated as threatened or endangered, or is a candidate for such designation under the Endangered Species Act or any Florida statute; 2. Protecting areas underlying low-level military air corridors or operating areas; 3. Protecting areas identified as clear zones, accident potential zones, and air installation compatible use buffer zones delineated by our military partners; and 4. Providing the military with technical assistance to restore, enhance, and manage military land as habitat for imperiled species or species designated as threatened or endangered, or a candidate for such designation, and for the recovery or reestablishment of such species. (3) Less the costs of issuing and the costs of funding reserve accounts and other costs associated with bonds, the proceeds of cash payments or bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the Florida Forever Trust Fund created by s. 259.1051. The proceeds shall be distributed by the Department of Environmental Protection in the following manner: (a) Thirty percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for the acquisition of lands and capital project expenditures necessary to implement the water management districts’ priority lists developed pursuant to s. 373.199. The funds are to be distributed to the water management districts as provided in subsection (11). A minimum of 50 percent of the total funds provided over the life of the Florida Forever program pursuant to this paragraph shall be used for the acquisition of lands. (b) Thirty-five percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for the acquisition of lands and capital project expenditures described in this section. Of the proceeds distributed pursuant to this paragraph, it is the intent of the Legislature that an increased priority be given to those acquisitions which achieve a combination of conservation goals, including protecting Florida’s water resources and natural groundwater recharge. At a minimum, 3 percent, and no more than 10 percent, of the funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on capital project expenditures identified during the time of acquisition which meet land management planning activities necessary for public access. Beginning in the 2017-2018 fiscal year and continuing through the 2026-2027 fiscal year, at least $5 million of the funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on land acquisition within the Florida Keys Area of Critical State Concern as authorized pursuant to s. 259.045. (c) Twenty-one percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for use by the Florida Communities Trust for the purposes of part III of chapter 380, as described and limited by this subsection, and grants to local governments or nonprofit environmental organizations that are tax-exempt under s. 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code for the acquisition of community-based projects, urban open spaces, parks, and greenways to implement local government comprehensive plans. From funds available to the trust and used for land acquisition, 75 percent shall be matched by local governments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The Legislature intends that the Florida Communities Trust emphasize funding projects in low-income or otherwise disadvantaged communities and projects that provide areas for direct water access and water-dependent facilities that are open to the public and offer public access by vessels to waters of the state, including boat ramps and associated parking and other support facilities. At least 30 percent of the total allocation provided to the trust shall be used in Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, but one-half of that amount shall be used in localities in which the project site is located in built-up commercial, industrial, or mixed-use areas and functions to intersperse open spaces within congested urban core areas. From funds allocated to the trust, no less than 5 percent shall be used to acquire lands for recreational trail systems, provided that in the event these funds are not needed for such projects, they will be available for other trust projects. Local governments may use federal grants or loans, private donations, or environmental mitigation funds for any part or all of any local match required for acquisitions funded through the Florida Communities Trust. Any lands purchased by nonprofit organizations using funds allocated under this paragraph must provide for such lands to remain permanently in public use through a reversion of title to local or state government, conservation easement, or other appropriate mechanism. Projects funded with funds allocated to the trust shall be selected in a competitive process measured against criteria adopted in rule by the trust. (d) Two percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for grants pursuant to s. 375.075. (e) One and five-tenths percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for the purchase of inholdings and additions to state parks and for capital project expenditures as described in this section. At a minimum, 1 percent, and no more than 10 percent, of the funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on capital project expenditures identified during the time of acquisition which meet land management planning activities necessary for public access. For the purposes of this paragraph, “state park” means any real property in the state which is under the jurisdiction of the Division of Recreation and Parks of the department, or which may come under its jurisdiction. (f) One and five-tenths percent to the Florida Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to fund the acquisition of state forest inholdings and additions pursuant to s. 589.07, the implementation of reforestation plans or sustainable forestry management practices, and for capital project expenditures as described in this section. At a minimum, 1 percent, and no more than 10 percent, of the funds allocated for the acquisition of inholdings and additions pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on capital project expenditures identified during the time of acquisition which meet land management planning activities necessary for public access. (g) One and five-tenths percent to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to fund the acquisition of inholdings and additions to lands managed by the commission which are important to the conservation of fish and wildlife and for capital project expenditures as described in this section. At a minimum, 1 percent, and no more than 10 percent, of the funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on capital project expenditures identified during the time of acquisition which meet land management planning activities necessary for public access. (h) One and five-tenths percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for the Florida Greenways and Trails Program, to acquire greenways and trails or greenways and trail systems pursuant to chapter 260, including, but not limited to, abandoned railroad rights-of-way and the Florida National Scenic Trail and for capital project expenditures as described in this section. At a minimum, 1 percent, and no more than 10 percent, of the funds allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be spent on capital project expenditures identified during the time of acquisition which meet land management planning activities necessary for public access. (i) Three and five-tenths percent to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the acquisition of agricultural lands, through perpetual conservation easements and other perpetual less than fee techniques, which will achieve the objectives of Florida Forever and s. 570.71. Rules concerning the application, acquisition, and priority ranking process for such easements shall be developed pursuant to s. 570.71(11) and as provided by this paragraph. The board shall ensure that such rules are consistent with the acquisition process provided for in s. 570.715. The rules developed pursuant to s. 570.71(11), shall also provide for the following: 1. An annual priority list shall be developed pursuant to s. 570.71(11), submitted to the council for review, and approved by the board pursuant to s. 259.04. By March 1, 2024, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall submit an updated priority list to the council. Any acquisitions for which funds have been obligated before July 1, 2023, to pay for an appraisal may not be impacted by the updated priority list. 2. Terms of easements and acquisitions proposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be approved by the board and may not be delegated by the board to any other entity receiving funds under this section. 3. All acquisitions pursuant to this paragraph shall contain a clear statement that they are subject to legislative appropriation. Funds provided under this paragraph may not be expended until final adoption of rules by the board pursuant to s. 570.71. (j) Two and five-tenths percent to the Department of Environmental Protection for the acquisition of land and capital project expenditures necessary to implement the Stan Mayfield Working Waterfronts Program within the Florida Communities Trust pursuant to s. 380.5105. (k) It is the intent of the Legislature that cash payments or proceeds of Florida Forever bonds distributed under this section shall be expended in an efficient and fiscally responsible manner. An agency that receives proceeds from Florida Forever bonds under this section may not maintain a balance of unencumbered funds in its Florida Forever subaccount beyond 3 fiscal years from the date of deposit of funds from each bond issue. Any funds that have not been expended or encumbered after 3 fiscal years from the date of deposit shall be distributed by the Legislature at its next regular session for use in the Florida Forever program. (l) For the purposes of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h), the agencies that receive the funds shall develop their individual acquisition or restoration lists in accordance with specific criteria and numeric performance measures developed pursuant to s. 259.035(4). Proposed additions may be acquired if they are identified within the original project boundary, the management plan required pursuant to s. 253.034(5), or the management prospectus required pursuant to s. 259.032(7)(b). Proposed additions not meeting the requirements of this paragraph shall be submitted to the council for approval.

(c) For purposes of this section, the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund shall adopt rules that pertain to the use of state lands for carbon sequestration, carbon mitigation, or carbon offsets and that provide for climate-change-related benefits. (6) As provided in this section, a water resource or water supply development project may be allowed only if the following conditions are met: minimum flows and levels have been established for those waters, if any, which may reasonably be expected to experience significant harm to water resources as a result of the project; the project complies with all applicable permitting requirements; and the project is consistent with the regional water supply plan, if any, of the water management district and with relevant recovery or prevention strategies if required pursuant to s. 373.0421(2). (7)(a) No later than July 1 annually, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall accept applications from state agencies, local governments, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, private land trusts, and individuals for project proposals eligible for funding pursuant to paragraph (3)(b). The council shall evaluate the proposals received pursuant to this subsection to ensure that they meet at least one of the criteria under subsection (9). (b) Project applications shall contain, at a minimum, the following: 1. A minimum of two numeric performance measures that directly relate to the overall goals adopted by the council. Each performance measure shall include a baseline measurement, which is the current situation; a performance standard which the project sponsor anticipates the project will achieve; and the performance measurement itself, which should reflect the incremental improvements the project accomplishes towards achieving the performance standard. 2. Proof that property owners within any proposed acquisition have been notified of their inclusion in the proposed project. Any property owner may request the removal of such property from further consideration by submitting a request to the project sponsor or the Acquisition and Restoration Council by certified mail. Upon receiving this request, the council shall delete the property from the proposed project; however, the board of trustees, at the time it votes to approve the proposed project lists pursuant to subsection (16), may add the property back on to the project lists if it determines by a super majority of its members that such property is critical to achieve the purposes of the project. (c) The title to lands acquired under this section shall vest in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, except that title to lands acquired by a water management district shall vest in the name of that district and lands acquired by a local government shall vest in the name of the purchasing local government.

(9) The Acquisition and Restoration Council shall recommend rules for adoption by the board of trustees to competitively evaluate, select, and rank projects eligible for Florida Forever funds pursuant to paragraph (3)(b). In developing these proposed rules, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall give weight to the following criteria: (a) The project meets multiple goals described in subsection (4). (b) The project is part of an ongoing governmental effort to restore, protect, or develop land areas or water resources. (c) The project enhances or facilitates management of properties already under public ownership. (d) The project has significant archaeological or historic value. (e) The project has funding sources that are identified and assured through at least the first 2 years of the project. (f) The project contributes to the solution of water resource problems on a regional basis. (g) The project has a significant portion of its land area in imminent danger of development, in imminent danger of losing its significant natural attributes or recreational open space, or in imminent danger of subdivision which would result in multiple ownership and make acquisition of the project costly or less likely to be accomplished. (h) The project implements an element from a plan developed by an ecosystem management team. (i) The project is one of the components of the Everglades restoration effort. (j) The project may be purchased at 80 percent of appraised value. (k) The project may be acquired, in whole or in part, using alternatives to fee simple, including but not limited to, tax incentives, mitigation funds, or other revenues; the purchase of development rights, hunting rights, agricultural or silvicultural rights, or mineral rights; or obtaining conservation easements or flowage easements. (l) The project is a joint acquisition, either among public agencies, nonprofit organizations, or private entities, or by a public-private partnership. (10) The council shall give increased priority to: (a) Projects for which matching funds are available. (b) Project elements previously identified on an acquisition list pursuant to this section that can be acquired at 80 percent or less of appraised value. (c) Projects that can be acquired in less than fee ownership, such as a permanent conservation easement. (d) Projects that contribute to improving the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater. (e) Projects that contribute to improving the water quality and flow of springs.

Protecting habitat on nonmilitary land for any species found on military land that is designated as threatened or endangered, or is a candidate for such designation under the Endangered Species Act or any Florida statute; 2. Protecting areas underlying low-level military air corridors or operating areas; and 3. Protecting areas identified as clear zones, accident potential zones, and air installation compatible use buffer zones delineated by our military partners, and for which federal or other funding is available to assist with the project. (g) Projects in imminent danger of development, loss of significant natural attributes or recreational open space, or subdivision, which would result in multiple ownership and make acquisition of the project costly or less likely to be accomplished. (h) Projects located within the Florida wildlife corridor as defined in s. 259.1055(4). (11) For the purposes of funding projects pursuant to paragraph (3)(a), the Secretary of Environmental Protection shall ensure that each water management district receives the following percentage of funds annually: (a) Thirty-five percent to the South Florida Water Management District, of which amount $25 million for 2 years beginning in fiscal year 2000-2001 shall be transferred by the Department of Environmental Protection into the Save Our Everglades Trust Fund and shall be used exclusively to implement the comprehensive plan under s. 373.470. (b) Twenty-five percent to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. (c) Twenty-five percent to the St. Johns River Water Management District. (d) Seven and one-half percent to the Suwannee River Water Management District. (e) Seven and one-half percent to the Northwest Florida Water Management District. (12) It is the intent of the Legislature that in developing the list of projects for funding pursuant to paragraph (3)(a), that these funds not be used to abrogate the financial responsibility of those point and nonpoint sources that have contributed to the degradation of water or land areas. Therefore, an increased priority shall be given by the water management district governing boards to those projects that have secured a cost-sharing agreement allocating responsibility for the cleanup of point and nonpoint sources. (13) An affirmative vote of at least five members of the council shall be required in order to place a project submitted pursuant to subsection (7) on the proposed project list developed pursuant to subsection (8). Any member of the council who by family or a business relationship has a connection with any project proposed to be ranked shall declare such interest before voting for a project’s inclusion on the list. (14) Each year that cash disbursements or bonds are to be issued pursuant to this section, the Acquisition and Restoration Council shall review the most current approved project list and shall, by the first board meeting in May, present to the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund for approval a listing of projects developed pursuant to subsection (8). The board of trustees may remove projects from the list developed pursuant to this subsection, but may not add projects or rearrange project rankings. (15) The council shall submit to the board, with its list of projects, a report that includes, but need not be limited to, the following information for each project listed: (a) The stated purpose for inclusion. (b) Projected costs to achieve the project goals. (c) An interim management budget that includes all costs associated with immediate public access. (d) Specific performance measures. (e) Plans for public access. (f) An identification of the essential parcel or parcels within the project without which the project cannot be properly managed. (g) Where applicable, an identification of those projects or parcels within projects which should be acquired in fee simple or in less than fee simple. (h) An identification of those lands being purchased for conservation purposes. (i) A management policy statement for the project and a management prospectus pursuant to s. 259.032(7)(b). (j) An estimate of land value based on county tax assessed values. (k) A map delineating project boundaries. (l) An assessment of the project’s ecological value, outdoor recreational value, forest resources, wildlife resources, ownership pattern, utilization, and location. (m) A discussion of whether alternative uses are proposed for the property and what those uses are. (n) A designation of the management agency or agencies. (16) All proposals for projects pursuant to paragraph (3)(b) shall be implemented only if adopted by the Acquisition and Restoration Council and approved by the board of trustees. The council shall consider and evaluate in writing the merits and demerits of each project that is proposed for Florida Forever funding. The council shall ensure that each proposed project will meet a stated public purpose for the restoration, conservation, or preservation of environmentally sensitive lands and water areas or for providing outdoor recreational opportunities. The council also shall determine whether the project or addition conforms, where applicable, with the comprehensive plan developed pursuant to s. 259.04(1)(a), the comprehensive multipurpose outdoor recreation plan developed pursuant to s. 375.021, the state lands management plan adopted pursuant to s. 253.03(7), the water resources work plans developed pursuant to s. 373.199, and the provisions of this section. (17) On an annual basis, the Division of State Lands shall prepare an annual work plan that prioritizes projects on the Florida Forever list and sets forth the funding available in the fiscal year for land acquisition. The work plan shall consider the following categories of expenditure for land conservation projects already selected for the Florida Forever list pursuant to subsection (8): (a) A critical natural lands category, including functional landscape-scale natural systems, intact large hydrological systems, lands that have significant imperiled natural communities, and corridors linking large landscapes, as identified and developed by the best available scientific analysis. (b) A partnerships or regional incentive category, including: 1. Projects where local and regional cost-share agreements provide a lower cost and greater conservation benefit to the people of the state. Additional consideration shall be provided under this category where parcels are identified as part of a local or regional visioning process and are supported by scientific analysis; and 2. Bargain and shared projects where the state will receive a significant reduction in price for public ownership of land as a result of the removal of development rights or other interests in lands or receives alternative or matching funds. (c) A substantially complete category of projects where mainly inholdings, additions, and linkages between preserved areas will be acquired and where 85 percent of the project is complete. (d) A climate-change category list of lands where acquisition or other conservation measures will address the challenges of global climate change, such as through protection, restoration, mitigation, and strengthening of Florida’s land, water, and coastal resources. This category includes lands that provide opportunities to sequester carbon, provide habitat, protect coastal lands or barrier islands, and otherwise mitigate and help adapt to the effects of sea-level rise and meet other objectives of the program. (e) A less-than-fee category for working agricultural lands that significantly contribute to resource protection through conservation easements and other less-than-fee techniques, tax incentives, life estates, landowner agreements, and other partnerships, including conservation easements acquired in partnership with federal conservation programs, which will achieve the objectives of Florida Forever while allowing the continuation of compatible agricultural uses on the land. Terms of easements proposed for acquisition under this category shall be developed by the Division of State Lands in coordination with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Projects within each category shall be ranked by order of priority. The work plan shall be adopted by the Acquisition and Restoration Council after at least one public hearing. A copy of the work plan shall be provided to the board of trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund no later than October 1 of each year. (18)(a) The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, or, in the case of water management district lands, the owning water management district, may authorize the granting of a lease, easement, or license for the use of certain lands acquired pursuant to this section, for certain uses that are determined by the appropriate board to be compatible with the resource values of and management objectives for such lands. (b) Any existing lease, easement, or license acquired for incidental public or private use on, under, or across any lands acquired pursuant to this section shall be presumed to be compatible with the purposes for which such lands were acquired. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), no such lease, easement, or license shall be entered into by the Department of Environmental Protection or other appropriate state agency if the granting of such lease, easement, or license would adversely affect the exclusion of the interest on any revenue bonds issued to fund the acquisition of the affected lands from gross income for federal income tax purposes, pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations. (19) The council shall recommend adoption of rules by the board necessary to implement this section relating to solicitation, scoring, selecting, and ranking of Florida Forever project proposals; disposing of or leasing lands or water areas selected for funding through the Florida Forever program; and the process of reviewing and recommending for approval or rejection the land management plans associated with publicly owned properties. (20) Lands listed as projects for acquisition under the Florida Forever program may be managed for conservation pursuant to s. 259.032, on an interim basis by a private party in anticipation of a state purchase in accordance with a contractual arrangement between the acquiring agency and the private party that may include management service contracts, leases, cost-share arrangements, or resource conservation agreements. Lands designated as eligible under this subsection shall be managed to maintain or enhance the resources the state is seeking to protect by acquiring the land and to accelerate public access to the lands as soon as practicable. Funding for these contractual arrangements may originate from the documentary stamp tax revenue deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. No more than $6.2 million may be expended from the Land Acquisition Trust Fund for this purpose.

      "text": "259.1053 Babcock Ranch Preserve; Babcock Ranch Advisory Group.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Babcock Ranch Preserve Act.” (2) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Babcock Ranch Preserve” and “preserve” mean the lands and facilities acquired in the purchase of the Babcock Crescent B Ranch, as provided in s. 259.1052. (b) “Commission” means the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. (c) “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of Agriculture. (d) “Department” means the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (e) “Executive director” means the Executive Director of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. (f) “Financially self-sustaining” means having management and operation expenditures not more than the revenues collected from fees and other receipts for resource use and development and from interest and invested funds. (g) “Florida Forest Service” means the Florida Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (h) “Multiple use” means the management of all of the renewable surface resources of the Babcock Ranch Preserve to best meet the needs of the public, including the use of the land for some or all of the renewable surface resources or related services over areas large enough to allow for periodic adjustments in use to conform to the changing needs and conditions of the preserve while recognizing that a portion of the land will be used for some of the renewable surface resources available on that land. The goal of multiple use is the harmonious and coordinated management of the renewable surface resources without impairing the productivity of the land and considering the relative value of the renewable surface resources, and not necessarily a combination of uses to provide the greatest monetary return or the greatest unit output. (i) “Sustained yield of the renewable surface resources” means the achievement and maintenance of a high level of annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable surface resources of the preserve without impairing the productivity of the land. (3) CREATION OF BABCOCK RANCH PRESERVE.— (a) Upon the date of acquisition of the Babcock Crescent B Ranch, there is created the Babcock Ranch Preserve, which shall be managed in accordance with the purposes and requirements of this section. (b) The preserve is established to protect and preserve the environmental, agricultural, scientific, scenic, geologic, watershed, fish, wildlife, historic, cultural, and recreational values of the preserve, and to provide for the multiple use and sustained yield of the renewable surface resources within the preserve consistent with this section. (c) This section does not preclude the use of common varieties of mineral materials such as sand, stone, and gravel for construction and maintenance of roads and facilities within the preserve. (d) This section does not affect the constitutional responsibilities of the commission in the exercise of its regulatory and executive power with respect to wild animal life and freshwater aquatic life, including the regulation of hunting, fishing, and trapping within the preserve.

      "text": "259.1055 Florida wildlife corridor.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Florida Wildlife Corridor Act.” (2) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that this state’s population is growing rapidly and that lands and waters that provide this state’s green infrastructure and vital habitat for wide-ranging wildlife, such as the Florida panther, need to be preserved and protected. The Legislature further finds that the Florida wildlife corridor is an existing physical, geographically defined area consisting of more than 18 million acres of land, 10 million of which are conservation lands. (3) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this act, and of the Florida wildlife corridor itself, is to create incentives for conservation and sustainable development while sustaining and conserving the green infrastructure that is the foundation of this state’s economy and quality of life by doing all of the following: (a) Maintaining wildlife access to the habitats needed to allow for migration of and genetic exchange amongst regional wildlife populations. (b) Preventing fragmentation of wildlife habitats. (c) Protecting the headwaters of major watersheds, including the Everglades and the St. Johns River. (d) Providing ecological connectivity of the lands needed for flood and sea-level rise resiliency and large-scale ecosystem functions, such as water management and prescribed burns essential for land management and restoration. (e) Preserving and protecting land and waters that are not only vital to wildlife but are critical to this state’s groundwater recharge and that serve as watersheds that provide drinking water to most Floridians and help maintain the health of downstream coastal estuaries. (f) Providing for wildlife crossings for the protection and safety of wildlife and the traveling public. (g) Helping to sustain this state’s working ranches, farms, and forests that provide compatible wildlife habitats while sustaining rural prosperity and agricultural production. (4) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Conserved lands” means federal, state, or local lands owned or managed for conservation purposes, including, but not limited to, federal, state, and local parks; federal and state forests; wildlife management areas; wildlife refuges; military bases and airports with conservation lands; properties owned by land trusts and managed for conservation; and privately owned land with a conservation easement, including, but not limited to, ranches, forestry operations, and groves. (b) “Department” means the Department of Environmental Protection. (c) “Florida Ecological Greenways Network” is a periodically updated model developed to delineate large connected areas of statewide ecological significance. (d) “Florida wildlife corridor” means the conserved lands and opportunity areas defined by the department as priority one, two, and three categories of the Florida Ecological Greenways Network. (e) “Opportunity area” means those lands and waters within the Florida wildlife corridor which are not conserved lands and the green spaces within the Florida wildlife corridor which lack conservation status, are contiguous to or between conserved lands, and provide an opportunity to develop the Florida wildlife corridor into a statewide conservation network. (f) “Wildlife” has the same meaning as in Article II of the Wildlife Violator Compact Act, s. 379.2255. (g) “Wildlife corridor” means a network of connected wildlife habitats required for the long-term survival of and genetic exchange amongst regional wildlife populations which serves to prevent fragmentation by providing ecological connectivity of the lands needed to furnish adequate habitats and allow safe movement and dispersal. (h) “Wildlife crossing” means a landscape design element that connects two or more patches of wildlife habitat and that is meant to function as a safe conduit for wildlife over or beneath roads, waters, and other barriers to wildlife movement and that is designed to protect Florida panther and other critical wildlife habitat corridor connections and to reduce motor vehicle collisions with wildlife, to reduce the likelihood of injuries and mortalities to humans and wildlife from such collisions, and to reduce the potential for damage to motor vehicles from such collisions. (5) DUTIES OF THE DEPARTMENT.—The department shall: (a) Encourage all state, regional, and local agencies that acquire lands, including, but not limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Department of Transportation, to include in their land-buying efforts the acquisition of sufficient legal interest in opportunity areas to ensure the continued viability of the Florida wildlife corridor. (b) Encourage investment in conservation easements voluntarily entered into by private landowners to conserve opportunity areas. (c) Encourage state land-buying agencies and state land management agencies to consider the conservation of opportunity areas as a multiphased project for the purpose of listing, acquisition, and management. (d) Consider the inclusion of private funds to supplement the state’s contribution in its efforts to acquire a fee or less-than-fee interest in lands that contain recognized opportunity areas and conserved lands in the Florida wildlife corridor. (e) Seek opportunities to attract new sources of federal funding and to strengthen existing programs to protect and conserve the Florida wildlife corridor. (f) Encourage private landowners, through existing and future incentives and liability protections, to continue to allow their private property to be used for the preservation and enhancement of the Florida wildlife corridor. (g) Encourage new approaches and novel financing mechanisms for long-term protection of the Florida wildlife corridor, including, but not limited to, public-private partnerships; payments for ecosystem services; blended financing for growth, resilience, and green infrastructure; and support for the sustainable growth of agriculture. (h) Encourage state and local agencies with economic and ecotourism development responsibilities to recognize the importance of the Florida wildlife corridor in encouraging public access to wildlife areas and bringing nature-based tourism to local communities and to support acquisition and development activities for preservation and enhancement of the Florida wildlife corridor. (i) Encourage private investment in ecotourism focused on the Florida wildlife corridor. (j) Encourage the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the natural value of the Florida wildlife corridor for current and future residents of this state. (6) MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.—The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is authorized to enter into voluntary agreements with private landowners for environmental services within the Florida wildlife corridor. (a) The agreements must require that the landowner protect and restore water resources; improve management of wildlife habitat, including the long-term conservation of forest and grassland soils and native plants; manage the land in a manner that keeps the desired ecosystem healthy for protected species, such as the gopher tortoise and the Florida panther; or provide other incentives to landowners to continue and improve land uses that are both economically sustainable and beneficial to the environment of this state. (b) The commission shall ensure that any agreement for environmental services entered into requires the landowner to manage the land in a manner that improves or enhances the land beyond what is required under any other agreement or contract the landowner may have with the state.
