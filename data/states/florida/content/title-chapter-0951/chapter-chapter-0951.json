If the prisoner’s cash account does not contain sufficient funds to cover medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation, then the detention facility may place a lien against the prisoner’s cash account or other personal property, to provide payment in the event sufficient funds become available at a later time. Any existing lien may be carried over to future incarceration of the same prisoner as long as the future incarceration takes place within the county originating the lien and the future incarceration takes place within 3 years of the date the lien was placed against the prisoner’s account or other personal property. (b) From an insurance company, health care corporation, or other source if the prisoner or person is covered by an insurance policy or subscribes to a health care corporation or other source for those expenses. (2) A prisoner who receives medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation shall cooperate with the county detention facility or municipal detention facility in seeking reimbursement under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) for expenses incurred by the facility for the prisoner. A prisoner who willfully refuses to cooperate with the reimbursement efforts of the detention facility may have a lien placed against the prisoner’s cash account or other personal property and may not receive gain-time as provided by s. 951.21.

In addition to a prisoner’s cash account on deposit in local detention facilities, many prisoners have sources of income and assets outside of the facility, which may include bank accounts, inheritances, real estate, social security payments, veteran’s payments, and other types of financial resources. (2) The local detention facility shall determine the financial status of prisoners for the purpose of paying from their income and assets all or a fair portion of their daily subsistence costs. In determining the financial status of prisoners, any income exempt by state or federal law shall be excluded. Consideration shall be given to the prisoner’s ability to pay, the liability or potential liability of the prisoner to the victim or guardian or the estate of the victim, and his or her dependents. (3) The chief correctional officer of a local subdivision may direct a prisoner to pay for all or a fair portion of daily subsistence costs. A prisoner is entitled to reasonable advance notice of the assessment and shall be afforded an opportunity to present reasons for opposition to the assessment. (4) An order from the chief correctional officer directing payment of all or a fair portion of a prisoner’s daily subsistence costs may survive against the estate of the sentenced prisoner. (5) The chief correctional officer may seek payment for the prisoner’s subsistence costs from: (a) The prisoner’s cash account on deposit at the facility; or (b) A civil restitution lien on the prisoner’s cash account on deposit at the facility or on other personal property. (6) If the prisoner’s cash account at the local detention facility does not contain sufficient funds to cover subsistence costs, the chief correctional officer may place a civil restitution lien against the prisoner’s cash account or other personal property. A civil restitution lien may continue for a period of 3 years and applies to the cash account of any prisoner who is reincarcerated within the county in which the civil restitution lien was originated.

The Department of Corrections, upon the request of the court, is authorized to conduct such investigations as are necessary and to make recommendations to the court pertaining to the suitability of the plan for the prisoner and to supervise such prisoner if released under this program.

The sheriff shall charge the prisoner’s account, if he or she has one, for such board. If the prisoner is gainfully self-employed he or she shall deposit with the sheriff an amount determined by the court sufficient to accomplish the provisions of subparagraphs (a)1.-5., in default of which his or her privileges under this section are automatically forfeited. (d) The board of county commissioners of any county may, upon the recommendation of the sheriff, authorize the person in charge of a county stockade or workcamp to implement paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), when such facility is not directly under the sheriff. (4) Any prisoner who willfully fails to remain within the extended limits of his or her confinement or to return within the time prescribed to the place of confinement shall be deemed an escapee from custody and shall be subject to punishment as prescribed by law. (5) Exchange for the purpose of work-release of county prisoners among other counties of the state that have implemented work-release programs is hereby authorized, with the concurrence of the sheriffs of the involved counties. For the purpose of this subsection, upon exchange, the prisoner shall be deemed a prisoner of the county where confined unless or until he or she is removed from extended confinement status. Prisoners from other jurisdictions, serving lawful sentences, may also be received into a county work-release program as above provided. (6) In carrying out the purpose of this section, any board of county commissioners may provide in its annual budget for payment to the Department of Corrections out of funds collected from those being supervised such amounts as are agreed upon by the board and department to be reasonable and necessary. County judges are hereby authorized to levy $10 per month upon those supervised for purposes of paying for supervision under this act.

      "text": "951.27 Blood tests of inmates.— (1) Each county and each municipal detention facility must develop a written procedure regarding the blood testing of inmates in consultation with the facility medical provider. The written procedure must: (a) Include conditions under which an inmate will be tested for infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus pursuant to s. 775.0877, which procedure is consistent with guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and recommendations of the Correctional Medical Authority. (b) Specify the conditions which require the detention facility to test an inmate for infectious diseases immediately following his or her booking into a detention facility, including upon receipt of a notice of exposure under subsection (4). (c) Require the test results to be provided to: 1. The sheriff or chief correctional officer of the detention facility. 2. Employees or officers of the sheriff or chief correctional officer who are responsible for the care and custody of the affected inmate. 3. Any employees or officers of the sheriff or chief correctional officer, or any first responders, as defined in s. 112.1815, who provided a notice of exposure to the detention facility as required under subsection (4). (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, serologic blood test results obtained pursuant to subsection (1) are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. However, it is not unlawful for the person receiving the test results to divulge the test results to the sheriff or chief correctional officer. Such test results must also be provided to employees or officers of the sheriff or chief correctional officer who are responsible for the custody and care of the affected inmate and have a need to know such information, 1 to any person who provided a notice of exposure under subsection (4), and as provided in ss. 775.0877 and 960.003. In addition, upon request of the victim or the victim’s legal guardian, or the parent or legal guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor, the results of any HIV test performed on an inmate arrested for any sexual offense involving oral, anal, or female genital penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another, must be disclosed to the victim or the victim’s legal guardian, or to the parent or legal guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor. In such cases, the county or municipal detention facility shall furnish the test results to the Department of Health, which is responsible for disclosing the results to public health agencies as provided in s. 775.0877 and to the victim or the victim’s legal guardian, or the parent or legal guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor, as provided in s. 960.003(3). As used in this subsection, the term “female genitals” includes the labia minora, labia majora, clitoris, vulva, hymen, and vagina. (3) The results of any serologic blood test on an inmate are a part of that inmate’s permanent medical file. Upon transfer of the inmate to any other correctional facility, such file is also transferred, and all relevant authorized persons must be notified of positive HIV test results, as required in s. 775.0877. (4)(a) Any first responder, as defined in s. 112.1815, or any employee or officer of the sheriff or chief correctional officer, who, in the performance of his or her official duties, is exposed to a bodily fluid or a potential bloodborne pathogen by a person who has been arrested and subsequently booked into a county or municipal detention facility must provide notice of such exposure to the detention facility as soon as possible after the person is booked, but no later than 24 hours after such exposure. If the first responder, employee, or officer is incapacitated and cannot provide the notice of exposure, his or her employing agency must provide such notice. (b) Upon receipt of a notice of exposure under paragraph (a), the detention facility must immediately test the inmate who was the cause of the exposure unless such a test has already been performed. The test must be conducted in accordance with the detention facility’s written procedures under subsection (1).
