      "text": "681.101 Legislative intent.—The Legislature recognizes that a motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase and that a defective motor vehicle undoubtedly creates a hardship for the consumer. The Legislature further recognizes that a duly franchised motor vehicle dealer is an authorized service agent of the manufacturer. It is the intent of the Legislature that a good faith motor vehicle warranty complaint by a consumer be resolved by the manufacturer within a specified period of time; however, it is not the intent of the Legislature that a consumer establish the presumption of a reasonable number of attempts as to each manufacturer that provides a warranty directly to the consumer. It is further the intent of the Legislature to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the warranty provided for in this chapter. However, nothing in this chapter shall in any way limit or expand the rights or remedies which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.

      "text": "681.104 Nonconformity of motor vehicles.— (1)(a) After three attempts have been made to repair the same nonconformity, the consumer shall give written notification, by registered or express mail to the manufacturer, of the need to repair the nonconformity to allow the manufacturer a final attempt to cure the nonconformity. The manufacturer shall have 10 days, commencing upon receipt of such notification, to respond and give the consumer the opportunity to have the motor vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility within a reasonable time after the consumer’s receipt of the response. The manufacturer shall have 10 days, except in the case of a recreational vehicle, in which event the manufacturer shall have 45 days, commencing upon the delivery of the motor vehicle to the designated repair facility by the consumer, to conform the motor vehicle to the warranty. If the manufacturer fails to respond to the consumer and give the consumer the opportunity to have the motor vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility or perform the repairs within the time periods prescribed in this subsection, the requirement that the manufacturer be given a final attempt to cure the nonconformity does not apply. (b) If the motor vehicle is out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities by the manufacturer or its authorized service agent for a cumulative total of 15 or more days, exclusive of downtime for routine maintenance prescribed by the owner’s manual, the consumer shall so notify the manufacturer in writing by registered or express mail to give the manufacturer or its authorized service agent an opportunity to inspect or repair the vehicle. (2)(a) If the manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, cannot conform the motor vehicle to the warranty by repairing or correcting any nonconformity after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer, within 40 days, shall repurchase the motor vehicle and refund the full purchase price to the consumer, less a reasonable offset for use, or, in consideration of its receipt of payment from the consumer of a reasonable offset for use, replace the motor vehicle with a replacement motor vehicle acceptable to the consumer. The refund or replacement must include all reasonably incurred collateral and incidental charges. However, the consumer has an unconditional right to choose a refund rather than a replacement motor vehicle. Upon receipt of such refund or replacement, the consumer, lienholder, or lessor shall furnish to the manufacturer clear title to and possession of the motor vehicle. (b) Refunds shall be made to the consumer and lienholder of record, if any, as their interests may appear. If applicable, refunds shall be made to the lessor and lessee as follows: The lessee shall receive the lessee cost and the lessor shall receive the lease price less the lessee cost. A penalty for early lease termination may not be assessed against a lessee who receives a replacement motor vehicle or refund under this chapter. The Department of Revenue shall refund to the manufacturer any sales tax which the manufacturer refunded to the consumer, lienholder, or lessor under this section, if the manufacturer provides to the department a written request for a refund and evidence that the sales tax was paid when the vehicle was purchased and that the manufacturer refunded the sales tax to the consumer, lienholder, or lessor. (3) It is presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to the warranty if, during the Lemon Law rights period, either: (a) The same nonconformity has been subject to repair at least three times by the manufacturer or its authorized service agent, plus a final attempt by the manufacturer to repair the motor vehicle if undertaken as provided for in paragraph (1)(a), and such nonconformity continues to exist; or (b) The motor vehicle has been out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities by the manufacturer, or its authorized service agent, for a cumulative total of 30 or more days, 60 or more days in the case of a recreational vehicle, exclusive of downtime for routine maintenance prescribed by the owner’s manual. The manufacturer or its authorized service agent must have had at least one opportunity to inspect or repair the vehicle following receipt of the notification as provided in paragraph (1)(b). The 30-day period, or 60-day period in the case of a recreational vehicle, may be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of war, invasion, strike, fire, flood, or natural disaster. (4) It is an affirmative defense to any claim under this chapter that: (a) The alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the motor vehicle; (b) The nonconformity is the result of an accident, abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations of the motor vehicle by persons other than the manufacturer or its authorized service agent; or (c) The claim by the consumer was not filed in good faith. Any other affirmative defense allowed by law may be raised against the claim.

The decisionmakers for a certified procedure shall, in rendering decisions, take into account all legal and equitable factors germane to a fair and just decision, including, but not limited to, the warranty; the rights and remedies conferred under 16 C.F.R. part 703, in effect October 1, 1983, as amended; the provisions of this chapter; and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. Decisionmakers and staff for a procedure shall be trained in the provisions of this chapter and in 16 C.F.R. part 703, in effect October 1, 1983, as amended. In an action brought by a consumer concerning an alleged nonconformity, the decision that results from a certified procedure is admissible in evidence. (2) A manufacturer may apply to the department for certification of its procedure. After receipt and evaluation of the application, the department shall: (a) Notify the manufacturer of any deficiencies in the application or the procedure; (b) Certify the procedure as substantially complying with the provisions of 16 C.F.R. part 703, in effect October 1, 1983, as amended, and with the provisions of this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter, for a period not to exceed 1 year; or (c) Deny certification, stating the reasons for such denial. (3) A certified procedure or a procedure of an applicant seeking certification shall submit to the department a copy of each settlement approved by the procedure or decision made by a decisionmaker within 30 days after the settlement is reached or the decision is rendered. The decision or settlement must contain at a minimum the: (a) Name and address of the consumer; (b) Name of the manufacturer and address of the dealership from which the motor vehicle was purchased; (c) Date the claim was received and the location of the procedure office that handled the claim; (d) Relief requested by the consumer; (e) Name of each decisionmaker rendering the decision or person approving the settlement; (f) Statement of the terms of the settlement or decision; (g) Date of the settlement or decision; and (h) Statement of whether the decision was accepted or rejected by the consumer. (4) Any manufacturer establishing or applying to establish a certified procedure must file with the department a copy of the annual audit required under the provisions of 16 C.F.R. part 703, in effect October 1, 1983, as amended, together with any additional information required for purposes of certification, including the number of refunds and replacements made in this state pursuant to the provisions of this chapter by the manufacturer during the period audited. (5) The department shall review each certified procedure at least annually to determine if certification should be renewed. A manufacturer seeking renewal of certification shall notify the department in writing at least 60 days before the end of the 1-year certification period. Upon review, the department shall: (a) Renew certification for a period not to exceed 1 year if the procedure is found to substantially comply with the provisions of 16 C.F.R. part 703, in effect October 1, 1983, as amended, and with the provisions of this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter; (b) Notify the manufacturer of any deficiencies in the procedure; or (c) Decline to renew certification. If certification is declined, the department shall state the reasons for such action. (6) If a manufacturer ceases operation of a certified procedure, the manufacturer shall notify the department immediately in writing, and upon receipt of such notification, the department shall revoke certification for that procedure, effective the date the certified procedure ceased. (7) A manufacturer whose certification is declined is entitled to a hearing pursuant to chapter 120. (8) If federal preemption of state authority to regulate procedures occurs, the provisions of subsection (1) concerning prior resort do not apply. (9) The department may adopt rules to administer this section.
