(b) The rights and duties under this chapter of a person in the capacity of manager. (c) The activities and affairs of the company and the conduct of those activities and affairs. (d) The means and conditions for amending the operating agreement. (2) To the extent the operating agreement does not otherwise provide for a matter described in subsection (1), this chapter governs the matter. (3) An operating agreement may not do any of the following: (a) Vary a limited liability company’s capacity under s. 605.0109 to sue and be sued in its own name. (b) Vary the law applicable under s. 605.0104. (c) Vary the requirement, procedure, or other provision of this chapter pertaining to: 1. Registered agents; or 2. The department, including provisions pertaining to records authorized or required to be delivered to the department for filing under this chapter. (d) Vary the provisions of s. 605.0204. (e) Eliminate the duty of loyalty or the duty of care under s. 605.04091, except as otherwise provided in subsection (4). (f) Eliminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under s. 605.04091, but the operating agreement may prescribe the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable. (g) Relieve or exonerate a person from liability for conduct involving bad faith, willful or intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (h) Unreasonably restrict the duties and rights stated in s. 605.0410, but the operating agreement may impose reasonable restrictions on the availability and use of information obtained under that section and may define appropriate remedies, including liquidated damages, for a breach of a reasonable restriction on use. (i) Vary the grounds for dissolution specified in s. 605.0702. A deadlock resolution mechanism does not vary the grounds for dissolution for the purposes of this paragraph. (j) Vary the requirement to wind up the company’s business, activities, and affairs as specified in s. 605.0709(1), (2)(a), and (5). (k) Unreasonably restrict the right of a member to maintain an action under ss. 605.0801-605.0806. (l) Vary the provisions of s. 605.0804, but the operating agreement may provide that the company may not appoint a special litigation committee. However, the operating agreement may not prevent a court from appointing a special litigation committee. (m) Vary the right of a member to approve a merger, interest exchange, or conversion under s. 605.1023(1)(b), s. 605.1033(1)(b), or s. 605.1043(1)(b), respectively. (n) Vary the required contents of plan of merger under s. 605.1022, a plan of interest exchange under s. 605.1032, a plan of conversion under s. 605.1042, or a plan of domestication under s. 605.1052. (o) Except as otherwise provided in ss. 605.0106 and 605.0107(2), restrict the rights under this chapter of a person other than a member or manager. (p) Provide for indemnification for a member or manager under s. 605.0408 for any of the following: 1. Conduct involving bad faith, willful or intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. 2. A transaction from which the member or manager derived an improper personal benefit. 3. A circumstance under which the liability provisions of s. 605.0406 are applicable. 4. A breach of duties or obligations under s. 605.04091, taking into account a restriction, an expansion, or an elimination of such duties and obligations provided for in the operating agreement to the extent allowed by subsection (4). (4) Subject to paragraph (3)(g), without limiting other terms that may be included in an operating agreement, the following rules apply: (a) The operating agreement may: 1. Specify the method by which a specific act or transaction that would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty may be authorized or ratified by one or more disinterested and independent persons after full disclosure of all material facts; or 2. Alter the prohibition stated in s. 605.0405(1)(b) so that the prohibition requires solely that the company’s total assets not be less than the sum of its total liabilities. (b) To the extent the operating agreement of a member-managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of responsibility that the member would otherwise have under this chapter and imposes the responsibility on one or more other members, the operating agreement may, to the benefit of the member that the operating agreement relieves of the responsibility, also eliminate or limit a duty or obligation that would have pertained to the responsibility. (c) If not manifestly unreasonable, the operating agreement may: 1. Alter or eliminate the aspects of the duty of loyalty under s. 605.04091(2); 2. Identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty; 3. Alter the duty of care, but may not authorize willful or intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; and 4. Alter or eliminate any other fiduciary duty. (5) The court shall decide as a matter of law whether a term of an operating agreement is manifestly unreasonable under paragraph (3)(f) or paragraph (4)(c). The court: (a) Shall make its determination as of the time the challenged term became part of the operating agreement and shall consider only circumstances existing at that time; and (b) May invalidate the term only if, in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the limited liability company, it is readily apparent that: 1. The objective of the term is unreasonable; or 2. The term is an unreasonable means to achieve the provision’s objective. (6) An operating agreement may provide for specific penalties or specified consequences, including those described in s. 605.0403(5), if a member or transferee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the operating agreement or if other events specified in the operating agreement occur.

(b) Must be distinguishable in the records of the department from the names of all other entities or filings that are on file with the department, except fictitious name registrations pursuant to s. 865.09, general partnership registrations pursuant to s. 620.8105, and limited liability partnership statements pursuant to s. 620.9001 which are organized, registered, or reserved under the laws of this state; however, a limited liability company may register under a name that is not otherwise distinguishable on the records of the department with the written consent of the other entity if the consent is filed with the department at the time of registration of such name and if such name is not identical to the name of the other entity. A name that is different from the name of another entity or filing due to any of the following is not considered distinguishable: 1. A suffix. 2. A definite or indefinite article. 3. The word “and” and the symbol “&.” 4. The singular, plural, or possessive form of a word. 5. A punctuation mark or a symbol.

(d) May not contain language stating or implying that the limited liability company is connected with a state or federal government agency or a corporation or other entity chartered under the laws of the United States. (2) Subject to s. 605.0905, this section applies to a foreign limited liability company transacting business in this state which has a certificate of authority to transact business in this state or which has applied for a certificate of authority. (3) In the case of a limited liability company in existence before July 1, 2007, and registered with the department, the requirement in this section that the name of a limited liability company be distinguishable from the names of other entities and filings applies only if the limited liability company files documents on or after July 1, 2007, which would otherwise have affected its name. (4) A limited liability company in existence before January 1, 2014, which was registered with the department and is using an abbreviation or designation in its name authorized under previous law, may continue using the abbreviation or designation in its name until it dissolves or amends its name in the records of the department. (5) The name of the limited liability company must be filed with the department for public notice only, and the act of filing alone does not create any presumption of ownership beyond that which is created under the common law. (6) A limited liability company in existence before January 1, 2020, that has a name that does not clearly indicate that it is a limited liability company instead of a natural person, partnership, corporation, or other business entity may continue using such name until the limited liability company dissolves or amends its name in the records of the department.

(4) When a statement of resignation takes effect, the registered agent ceases to have responsibility for a matter thereafter tendered to it as agent for the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company. The resignation does not affect contractual rights that the company or foreign limited liability company has against the agent or that the agent has against the company or foreign limited liability company. (5) A registered agent may resign from a limited liability company or foreign limited liability company regardless of whether the company or foreign limited liability company has active status. (6)(a) If a registered agent is resigning as registered agent from more than one limited liability company that each has been dissolved, either voluntarily, administratively, or by court action, for a continuous period of 10 years or longer, the registered agent may elect to file the statement of resignation separately for each such limited liability company or may elect to file a single composite statement of resignation covering two or more limited liability companies. Any such composite statement of resignation must set forth, for each such limited liability company covered by the statement of resignation, the name of the respective limited liability company and the date dissolution became effective for the respective limited liability company. (b) This subsection is applicable only to resignations from limited liability companies as defined in this chapter.

(9) After a company’s articles of dissolution become effective, a limited liability company may deliver to the department for filing and, if appropriate, may record a statement of authority in accordance with subsection (1) which is designated as a postdissolution statement of authority. The statement operates as provided in subsections (6) and (7). (10) Unless earlier canceled, an effective statement of authority is canceled by operation of law 5 years after the date on which the statement, or its most recent amendment, becomes effective. This cancellation operates without need for a recording under subsection (6) or subsection (7). An effective statement of denial operates as a restrictive amendment under this section and may be recorded by certified copy for the purposes of paragraph (6)(a). (11) A statement of dissociation or a statement of resignation filed pursuant to s. 605.0216 terminates the authority of the person who filed the statement. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.

(2) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (1) on: (a) Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the circumstances; or (b) A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances. (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), the effect of a distribution under subsection (1) is measured: (a) In the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a transferable interest in the company, as of the earlier of the date on which: 1. Money or other property is transferred or the debt is incurred by the company; and 2. The person entitled to distribution ceases to own the interest or right being acquired by the company in return for the distribution. (b) In the case of a distribution of indebtedness, as of the date on which the indebtedness is distributed. (c) In all other cases, as of the date on which: 1. The distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after that date; or 2. The payment is made if the payment occurs more than 120 days after the distribution is authorized. (4) A limited liability company’s indebtedness to a member or transferee incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors, except to the extent subordinated by agreement. (5) A limited liability company’s indebtedness, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (1) if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that a distribution could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, and by its terms provides that the payments of principal and interest are made only to the extent a distribution could be made under this section, then each payment of principal or interest of that indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made. (6) In measuring the effect of a distribution under s. 605.0710, the liabilities of a dissolved limited liability company do not include a claim that is disposed of under ss. 605.0710-605.0713.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the affirmative vote or consent of a majority-in-interest of the members is required to undertake an act outside the ordinary course of the company’s activities and affairs, including a transaction under ss. 605.1001-605.1072. (e) The operating agreement and articles of organization may be amended only with the affirmative vote or consent of all members. (3) If a member has transferred all or a portion of the member’s transferable interest in the limited liability company to a person who is not admitted as a member and if the transferring member has not been dissociated in accordance with s. 605.0602(5)(b), the transferring member continues to be entitled to vote on an action reserved to the members, with the vote of the transferring member being proportionate to the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of the limited liability company owned by all members that the transferring member would have if the transfer had not occurred. (4) An action requiring the vote or consent of members under this chapter may be taken without a meeting if the action is approved in a record by members with at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting of the members. A member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote or consent for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member’s agent. On an action taken by fewer than all of the members without a meeting, notice of the action must be given to those members who did not consent in writing to the action or who were not entitled to vote on the action within 10 days after the action was taken. (5) An action requiring the vote or consent of managers under this chapter may be taken without a meeting if the action is unanimously approved by the managers in a record. A manager may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote or consent for the manager by signing an appointing record, personally or by the manager’s agent. (6) Meetings of members and meetings of managers may be held by a conference telephone call or other communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection constitutes presence in person at the meeting. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180; s. 4, ch. 2015-148.

(b) An act of a member which is not done for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course of the limited liability company’s activities and affairs or activities and affairs of the kind carried on by the company, binds the company only if the act was authorized by appropriate vote of the members. (2) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply: (a) A member is not an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its business solely by reason of being a member. (b) Except as provided in subsection (3), each manager is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its activities and affairs, and an act of a manager, including signing an agreement or instrument of transfer in the name of the company, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course of the company’s activities and affairs or activities and affairs of the kind carried on by the company, binds the company unless the manager had no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager was dealing knew or had notice that the manager lacked authority.

(3) Unless a certified statement of authority recorded in the applicable real estate records limits the authority of a member or a manager, a member of a member-managed company or a manager of a manager-managed company may sign and deliver an instrument transferring or affecting the limited liability company’s interest in real property. The instrument is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge of the lack of the authority of the person signing and delivering the instrument.

(2) The duty of loyalty includes: (a) Accounting to the limited liability company and holding as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the manager or member, as applicable: 1. In the conduct or winding up of the company’s activities and affairs; 2. From the use by the member or manager of the company’s property; or 3. From the appropriation of a company opportunity; (b) Refraining from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company’s activities and affairs as, or on behalf of, a person having an interest adverse to the company, except to the extent that a transaction satisfies the requirements of s. 605.04092; and (c) Refraining from competing with the company in the conduct of the company’s activities and affairs before the dissolution of the company. (3) The duty of care in the conduct or winding up of the company’s activities and affairs is to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, willful or intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (4) A manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and a member of a member-managed limited liability company shall discharge their duties and obligations under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (5) A manager of a manager-managed limited liability company or a member of a member-managed limited liability company does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the operating agreement solely because the manager’s or member’s conduct furthers the manager’s or member’s own interest. (6) In discharging his, her, or its duties, a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company or a member of a member-managed limited liability company is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by any of the following: (a) One or more members or employees of the limited liability company whom the manager or member reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented. (b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the manager or member reasonably believes are within the persons’ professional or expert competence. (c) A committee of managers or members of which the affected manager or member is not a participant, if the manager or member reasonably believes the committee merits confidence. (7) A manager or member, as applicable, is not acting in good faith if the manager or member has knowledge concerning the matter in question which makes reliance otherwise authorized under subsection (6) unwarranted. (8) In discharging his, her, or its duties, a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company or member of a member-managed limited liability company may consider factors that the manager or member deems relevant, including the long-term prospects and interests of the limited liability company and its members, and the social, economic, legal, or other effects of any action on the employees, suppliers, and customers of the limited liability company, the communities and society in which the limited liability company operates, and the economy of this state and the nation. (9) This section applies to a person winding up the limited liability company activities and affairs as the legal representative of the last surviving member as if such person were subject to this section.

      "text": "605.04092 Conflict of interest transactions.— (1) As used in this section, the following terms and definitions apply: (a) A member or manager is “indirectly” a party to a transaction if that member or manager has a material financial interest in or is a director, officer, member, manager, or partner of a person, other than the limited liability company, who is a party to the transaction. (b) A member or manager has an “indirect material financial interest” if a family member has a material financial interest in the transaction, other than having an indirect interest as a member or manager of the limited liability company, or if the transaction is with an entity, other than the limited liability company, which has a material financial interest in the transaction and controls, or is controlled by, the member or manager or another person specified in this subsection. (c) “Fair to the limited liability company” means that the transaction, as a whole, is beneficial to the limited liability company and its members, taking into appropriate account whether it is: 1. Fair in terms of the member’s or manager’s dealings with the limited liability company in connection with that transaction; and 2. Comparable to what might have been obtainable in an arm’s length transaction. (d) “Family member” includes any of the following: 1. The member’s or manager’s spouse. 2. A child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, sibling, step sibling, or half sibling of the member or manager or the member’s or manager’s spouse. (e) “Manager’s conflict of interest transaction” means a transaction between a limited liability company and one or more of its managers, or another entity in which one or more of the limited liability company’s managers is directly or indirectly a party to the transaction, other than being an indirect party as a result of being a member of the limited liability company, and has a direct or indirect material financial interest or other material interest. (f) “Material financial interest” or “other material interest” means a financial or other interest in the transaction that would reasonably be expected to impair the objectivity of the judgment of the member or manager when participating in the action on the authorization of the transaction. (g) “Member’s conflict of interest transaction” means a transaction between a limited liability company and one or more of its members, or another entity in which one or more of the limited liability company’s members is directly or indirectly a party to the transaction, other than being an indirect party as a result of being a member of the limited liability company, and has a direct or indirect material financial interest or other material interest. (2) If the requirements of this section have been satisfied, a member’s conflict of interest transaction or a manager’s conflict of interest transaction between a limited liability company and one or more of its members or managers, or another entity in which one or more of the limited liability company’s members or managers have a financial or other interest, is not void or voidable because of that relationship or interest; because the members or managers are present at the meeting of the members or managers at which the transaction was authorized, approved, effectuated, or ratified; or because the votes of the members or managers are counted for such purpose. (3) If a member’s conflict of interest transaction or a manager’s conflict of interest transaction is fair to the limited liability company at the time it is authorized, approved, effectuated, or ratified, the fact that a member or manager of the limited liability company is directly or indirectly a party to the transaction, other than being an indirect party as a result of being a member or manager of the limited liability company, or has a direct or indirect material financial interest or other interest in the transaction, other than having an indirect interest as a result of being a member or manager of the limited liability company, is not grounds for equitable relief and does not give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions. (4)(a) In a proceeding challenging the validity of a member’s conflict of interest transaction or a manager’s conflict of interest transaction or in a proceeding seeking equitable relief, award of damages, or other sanctions with respect to a member’s conflict of interest transaction or a manager’s conflict of interest transaction, the person challenging the validity or seeking equitable relief, award of damages, or other sanctions has the burden of proving the lack of fairness of the transaction if: 1. In a manager-managed limited liability company, the material facts of the transaction and the member’s or manager’s interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the managers or a committee of managers who voted upon the transaction and the transaction was authorized, approved, or ratified by a majority of the disinterested managers even if the disinterested managers constitute less than a quorum; however, the transaction cannot be authorized, approved, or ratified under this subsection solely by a single manager; and 2. In a member-managed limited liability company, or a manager-managed limited liability company in which the managers have failed to or cannot act under subparagraph 1., the material facts of the transaction and the member’s or manager’s interest in the transaction were disclosed or known to the members who voted upon such transaction and the transaction was authorized, approved, or ratified by a majority-in-interest of the disinterested members even if the disinterested members constitute less than a quorum; however, the transaction cannot be authorized, approved, or ratified under this subsection solely by a single member; or (b) If neither of the conditions provided in paragraph (a) has been satisfied, the person defending or asserting the validity of a member’s conflict of interest transaction or a manager’s conflict of interest transaction has the burden of proving its fairness in a proceeding challenging the validity of the transaction. (5) The presence of or a vote cast by a manager or member with an interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of an action taken under paragraph (4)(a) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in subsection (4), but the presence or vote of the manager or member may be counted for purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. (6) In addition to other grounds for challenge, a party challenging the validity of the transaction is not precluded from asserting and proving that a particular member or manager was not disinterested on grounds of financial or other interest for purposes of the vote on, consent to, or approval of the transaction.

A violation of the criminal law unless the manager or member had a reasonable cause to believe his, her, or its conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. A judgment or other final adjudication against a manager or member in any criminal proceeding for a violation of the criminal law estops that manager or member from contesting the fact that such breach, or failure to perform, constitutes a violation of the criminal law, but does not estop the manager or member from establishing that he, she, or it had reasonable cause to believe that his, her, or its conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful. 2. A transaction from which the manager or member derived an improper personal benefit, directly or indirectly. 3. A distribution in violation of s. 605.0406. 4. In a proceeding by or in the right of the limited liability company to procure a judgment in its favor or by or in the right of a member, conscious disregard of the best interest of the limited liability company, or willful misconduct. 5. In a proceeding by or in the right of someone other than the limited liability company or a member, recklessness or an act or omission that was committed in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property. (2) As used in this section, the term “recklessness” means acting or failing to act in conscious disregard of a risk known, or a risk so obvious that it should have been known, to the manager in a manager-managed limited liability company or the member in a member-managed limited liability company, and known to the manager or member, or so obvious that it should have been known, to be so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow from such action or failure to act. (3) A manager in a manager-managed limited liability company or a member in a member-managed limited liability company is deemed not to have derived an improper personal benefit from any transaction if the transaction has been approved in the manner as is provided in s. 605.04092 or is fair to the limited liability company as defined in s. 605.04092(1)(c). (4) The circumstances set forth in subsection (3) are not exclusive and do not preclude the existence of other circumstances under which a manager in a manager-managed limited liability company or a member in a member-managed limited liability company will be deemed not to have derived an improper benefit.

(8) If a member transfers a transferable interest to a person who becomes a member with respect to the transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the member’s obligations under ss. 605.0403 and 605.0406(3) which are known to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member.

      "text": "605.0503 Charging order.— (1) On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee, the court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the member or transferee for payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. Except as provided in subsection (5), a charging order constitutes a lien upon a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability company to pay over to the judgment creditor a distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor. (2) This chapter does not deprive a member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the member or transferee. (3) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5), a charging order is the sole and exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or member’s transferee may satisfy a judgment from the judgment debtor’s interest in a limited liability company or rights to distributions from the limited liability company. (4) In the case of a limited liability company that has only one member, if a judgment creditor of a member or member’s transferee establishes to the satisfaction of a court of competent jurisdiction that distributions under a charging order will not satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time, a charging order is not the sole and exclusive remedy by which the judgment creditor may satisfy the judgment against a judgment debtor who is the sole member of a limited liability company or the transferee of the sole member, and upon such showing, the court may order the sale of that interest in the limited liability company pursuant to a foreclosure sale. A judgment creditor may make a showing to the court that distributions under a charging order will not satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time at any time after the entry of the judgment and may do so at the same time that the judgment creditor applies for the entry of a charging order. (5) If a limited liability company has only one member and the court orders a foreclosure sale of a judgment debtor’s interest in the limited liability company or of a charging order lien against the sole member of the limited liability company pursuant to subsection (4): (a) The purchaser at the court-ordered foreclosure sale obtains the member’s entire limited liability company interest, not merely the rights of a transferee; (b) The purchaser at the sale becomes the member of the limited liability company; and (c) The person whose limited liability company interest is sold pursuant to the foreclosure sale or is the subject of the foreclosed charging order ceases to be a member of the limited liability company. (6) In the case of a limited liability company that has more than one member, the remedy of foreclosure on a judgment debtor’s interest in the limited liability company or against rights to distribution from the limited liability company is not available to a judgment creditor attempting to satisfy the judgment and may not be ordered by a court. (7) This section does not limit any of the following: (a) The rights of a creditor who has been granted a consensual security interest in a limited liability company interest to pursue the remedies available to the secured creditor under other law applicable to secured creditors. (b) The principles of law and equity which affect fraudulent transfers. (c) The availability of the equitable principles of alter ego, equitable lien, or constructive trust or other equitable principles not inconsistent with this section. (d) The continuing jurisdiction of the court to enforce its charging order in a manner consistent with this section. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.

The limited liability company obtained its articles of organization through fraud; or 2. The limited liability company has continued to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law. The enumeration in subparagraphs 1. and 2. of grounds for involuntary dissolution does not exclude actions or special proceedings by the Department of Legal Affairs or a state official for the annulment or dissolution of a limited liability company for other causes as provided in another law of this state. (b) In a proceeding by a manager or member to dissolve the limited liability company if it is established that: 1. The conduct of all or substantially all of the company’s activities and affairs is unlawful; 2. It is not reasonably practicable to carry on the company’s activities and affairs in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement; 3. The managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or are reasonably expected to act in a manner that is illegal or fraudulent; 4. The limited liability company’s assets are being misappropriated or wasted, causing injury to the limited liability company, or in a proceeding by a member, causing injury to one or more of its members; or 5. The managers or the members of the limited liability company are deadlocked in the management of the limited liability company’s activities and affairs, the members are unable to break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the limited liability company is threatened or being suffered. (c) In a proceeding by the limited liability company to have its voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision. (2)(a) If the managers or the members of the limited liability company are deadlocked in the management of the limited liability company’s activities and affairs, the members are unable to break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the limited liability company is threatened or being suffered, if the operating agreement contains a deadlock sale provision that has been initiated before the time that the court determines that the grounds for judicial dissolution exist under subparagraph (1)(b)5., then such deadlock sale provision applies to the resolution of such deadlock instead of the court entering an order of judicial dissolution or an order directing the purchase of petitioner’s interest under s. 605.0706, so long as the provisions of such deadlock sale provision are thereafter initiated and effectuated in accordance with the terms of such deadlock sale provision or otherwise pursuant to an agreement of the members of the company. (b) For purposes of this section, the term “deadlock sale provision” means a provision in an operating agreement which is or may be applicable in the event of a deadlock among the managers or the members of the limited liability company which the members of the company are unable to break and which provides for a deadlock breaking mechanism, including, but not limited to: 1. A redemption or a purchase and sale of interests; 2. A governance change, among or between members; 3. The sale of the company or all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or 4. A similar provision that, if initiated and effectuated, breaks the deadlock by causing the transfer of interests, a governance change, or the sale of all or substantially all of the company’s assets. (3) A deadlock sale provision in an operating agreement which is not initiated and effectuated before the court enters an order of judicial dissolution under subparagraph (1)(b)5. or an order directing the purchase of petitioner’s interest under s. 605.0706, does not adversely affect the rights of members and managers to seek judicial dissolution under subparagraph (1)(b)5. or the rights of the company or one or more members to purchase the petitioner’s interest under s. 605.0706. The filing of an action for judicial dissolution on the grounds described in subparagraph (1)(b)5. or an election to purchase the petitioner’s interest under s. 605.0706, does not adversely affect the right of a member to initiate an available deadlock sale provision under the operating agreement or to enforce a member-initiated or an automatically-initiated deadlock sale provision if the deadlock sale provision is initiated and effectuated before the court enters an order of judicial dissolution under subparagraph (1)(b)5. or an order directing the purchase of petitioner’s interest under s. 605.0706.

      "text": "605.0704 Receivership or custodianship.— (1) A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a limited liability company may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate or one or more custodians to manage the business and affairs of the limited liability company. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and an interested person designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the limited liability company and all of its property, wherever located. (2) The court may appoint a person authorized to act as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs. (3) The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended. Among other powers: (a) The receiver: 1. May dispose of all or a part of the assets of the limited liability company, wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and 2. May sue and defend in the receiver’s own name, as receiver of the limited liability company, in all courts of this state; and (b) The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the limited liability company, through or in place of its managers or members, to the extent necessary to manage the activities and affairs of the limited liability company in the best interest of its members and creditors. (4) During a receivership, the court may redesignate the receiver as a custodian and, during a custodianship, may redesignate the custodian as a receiver if doing so is in the best interests of the limited liability company and its members and creditors. (5) During the receivership or custodianship the court may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and the receiver’s or custodian’s counsel from the assets of the limited liability company or proceeds from the sale of part or all of those assets. (6) The court has jurisdiction to appoint an ancillary receiver for the assets and business of a limited liability company. The ancillary receiver shall serve ancillary to a receiver located in another state if the court deems that circumstances exist requiring the appointment of such a receiver. The court may appoint a receiver for a foreign limited liability company even though a receiver has not been appointed elsewhere. The receivership shall be converted into an ancillary receivership if an order entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the other state provides for a receivership of the foreign limited liability company.

      "text": "605.0706 Election to purchase instead of dissolution.— (1) In a proceeding initiated by a member of a limited liability company under s. 605.0702(1)(b), the company may elect, or, if it fails to elect, one or more other members may elect, to purchase the entire interest of the petitioner in the company at the fair value of the interest. An election pursuant to this section is irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election. (2) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court within 90 days after the filing of the petition by the petitioning member under s. 605.0702(1)(b) or at such later time as the court may allow. If the election to purchase is filed, the company shall within 10 days thereafter give written notice to all members, other than the petitioning member. The notice must describe the interest in the company owned by each petitioning member and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase the petitioning member’s interest in accordance with this section. Members who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase within 30 days after the effective date of the notice. A member who has filed an election or notice of the intent to participate in the election to purchase thereby becomes a party to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to the ownership interest as of the date the first election was filed unless the members otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election to purchase has been filed by the limited liability company or one or more members, the proceeding under s. 605.0702(1)(b) may not be discontinued or settled, and the petitioning member may not sell or otherwise dispose of the interest of the petitioner in the company unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the company and the members, other than the petitioner, to authorize such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition or the sale is pursuant to a deadlock sale provision described in s. 605.0702(1)(b). (3) If, within 60 days after the filing of the first election, the parties reach an agreement as to the fair value and terms of the purchase of the petitioner’s interest, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of the petitioner’s interest upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, unless the petitioner’s interest has been acquired pursuant to a deadlock sale provision before the order. (4) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (3), the court, upon application of a party, may stay the proceedings to dissolve under s. 605.0702(1)(b) and shall, whether or not the proceeding is stayed, determine the fair value of the petitioner’s interest as of the day before the date on which the petition was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances. (5) Upon determining the fair value of the petitioner’s interest in the company, unless the petitioner’s interest has been acquired pursuant to a deadlock sale provision before the order, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include: payment of the purchase price in installments, when necessary in the interests of equity; a provision for security to ensure payment of the purchase price and additional costs, fees, and expenses as may have been awarded; and, if the interest is to be purchased by members, the allocation of the interest among those members. In allocating the petitioner’s interest among holders of different classes or series of interests in the company, the court shall attempt to preserve any existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes or series insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of any specific class or classes or series may not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable; however, if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning member to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, payment of interest is not allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning member had probable grounds for relief under s. 605.0702(1)(b), it may award expenses to the petitioning member, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of experts employed by petitioner. (6) The entry of an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5) shall be subject to subsection (8), and the order may not be entered unless the award is determined by the court to be allowed under subsection (8). In determining compliance with s. 605.0405, the court may rely on an affidavit from the limited liability company as to compliance with that section as of the measurement date. Upon entry of an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the limited liability company under s. 605.0702(1)(b), and the petitioning member shall no longer have rights or status as a member of the limited liability company except the right to receive the amounts awarded by the order of the court, which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment. (7) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (5) shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final. (8) Any award pursuant to an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5), other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (5), is subject to s. 605.0405. Unless otherwise provided in the court’s order, the effect of a distribution under s. 605.0405 shall be measured as of the date of the court’s order under subsection (3) or subsection (5).

Transfer title to the company’s real estate and other property; 4. Settle disputes by mediation or arbitration; 5. Dispose of its properties that will not be distributed in kind to its members; and 6. Perform other acts necessary or appropriate to the winding up.

If the legal representative does so, the person has the powers of a sole manager under s. 605.0407(3) and is deemed to be a manager for the purposes of s. 605.0304(1). (4) If the legal representative under subsection (3) declines or fails to wind up the company’s activities and affairs, a person may be appointed to do so by the consent of the transferees owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions as transferees at the time the consent is to be effective. A person appointed under this subsection has the powers of a sole manager under s. 605.0407(3) and is deemed to be a manager for the purposes of s. 605.0304(1).

The powers of the trustees or receivers may be continued as long as the court determines is necessary for the above purposes. (7) A dissolved limited liability company that has completed winding up may deliver to the department for filing a statement of termination that provides the following: (a) The name of the limited liability company. (b) The date of filing of its initial articles of organization. (c) The date of the filing of its articles of dissolution. (d) The limited liability company has completed winding up its activities and affairs and has determined that it will file a statement of termination.

(4) After appropriate investigation, a special litigation committee shall determine what action is in the best interest of the limited liability company, including continuing, dismissing, or settling the derivative action or taking another action that the special litigation committee deems appropriate. (5) After making a determination under subsection (4), a special litigation committee shall file or cause to be filed with the court a statement of its determination and its report supporting its determination and shall serve each party to the derivative action with a copy of the determination and report. Upon motion to enforce the determination of the special litigation committee, the court shall determine whether the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof.

(4) The failure of a foreign limited liability company to have a certificate of authority to transact business in this state does not impair the validity of any contract, deed, mortgage, security interest, or act of the foreign limited liability company or prevent the foreign limited liability company from defending an action or proceeding in this state. (5) A member or manager of a foreign limited liability company is not liable for the debts, obligations, or other liabilities of the foreign limited liability company solely because the foreign limited liability company transacted business in this state without a certificate of authority. (6) If a foreign limited liability company transacts business in this state without a certificate of authority or cancels its certificate of authority, it appoints the department as its agent for service of process for rights of action arising out of the transaction of business in this state. (7) A foreign limited liability company that transacts business in this state without obtaining a certificate of authority is liable to this state for the years or parts thereof during which it transacted business in this state without obtaining a certificate of authority in an amount equal to all fees and penalties that would have been imposed by this chapter upon the foreign limited liability company had it duly applied for and received a certificate of authority to transact business in this state as required under this chapter. In addition to the payments thus prescribed, the foreign limited liability company is liable for a civil penalty of at least $500 but not more than $1,000 for each year or part thereof during which it transacts business in this state without a certificate of authority. The department may collect all penalties due under this subsection. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180; s. 136, ch. 2014-17; s. 258, ch. 2019-90.

(b) Consummation of a conversion of such limited liability company pursuant to this chapter where the member possessed the right to vote upon the conversion. (c) Consummation of an interest exchange pursuant to this chapter where the member possessed the right to vote upon the interest exchange except that appraisal rights are not available to any interest holder of the limited liability company whose interest in the limited liability company is not subject to exchange in the interest exchange. (d) Consummation of a sale of substantially all of the assets of a limited liability company where the member possessed the right to vote upon the sale unless the sale is pursuant to court order or the sale is for cash pursuant to a plan under which all or substantially all of the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed to the interest holders within 1 year after the date of sale. (e) An amendment to the organic rules of the entity which reduces the interest of the holder to a fraction of an interest, if the limited liability company will be obligated to or will have the right to repurchase the fractional interest so created. (f) An amendment to the organic rules of an entity, the effect of which is to alter or abolish voting or other rights with respect to such interest in a manner that is adverse to the interest of such member, except as the right may be affected by the voting or other rights of new interests then being authorized of a new class or series of interests. (g) An amendment to the organic rules of an entity the effect of which is to adversely affect the interest of the member by altering or abolishing appraisal rights under this section. (h) To the extent otherwise expressly authorized by the organic rules of the limited liability company. (2) A limited liability company may modify, restrict, or eliminate the appraisal rights provided in this section in its organic rules if the provision modifying, restricting, or eliminating the appraisal rights is authorized by each member whose appraisal rights are being modified, restricted, or eliminated. Organic rules containing an express waiver of appraisal rights that are approved by a member constitute a waiver of appraisal rights with respect to such member to the extent provided in such organic rules. (3) To the extent that appraisal rights are available hereunder, ss. 605.1061-605.1072 govern the procedures with respect to such appraisal rights as between the limited liability company and its members. (4) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the availability of appraisal rights must be limited in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Appraisal rights are not available for holders of a membership interest that is: 1. A covered security under s. 18(b)(1)(A) or (B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; 2. Traded in an organized market and part of a class or series that has at least 2,000 members or other holders and a market value of at least $20 million, exclusive of the value of such class or series of membership interests held by the limited liability company’s subsidiaries, senior executives, managers, and beneficial members owning more than 10 percent of such class or series of membership interests; or 3. Issued by an open-end management investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and subject to being redeemed at the option of the holder at net asset value. (b) The applicability of paragraph (a) shall be determined as of the date fixed to determine the members entitled to receive notice of and to vote upon the appraisal event, or the day before the effective date of such appraisal event if there is no meeting of the members to vote upon the appraisal event. (c) This subsection does not apply to, and appraisal rights must be available pursuant to subsection (1) for, any members who are required by the appraisal event to accept for their membership interests anything other than cash or a proprietary interest in an entity that satisfies the standards provided in paragraph (a) at the time the appraisal event becomes effective. (d) This subsection does not apply to, and appraisal rights must be available pursuant to subsection (1) for, the holder of a membership interest if: 1. Any of the members’ interests in the limited liability company or the limited liability company’s assets are being acquired or converted, whether by merger, conversion, or otherwise, pursuant to the appraisal event by a person or by an affiliate of a person who: a. Is or at any time in the 1-year period immediately preceding approval of the appraisal event was the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of those interests in the limited liability company entitled to vote on the appraisal event, excluding any such interests acquired pursuant to an offer for all interests having such voting rights, if such offer was made within 1 year before the appraisal event for consideration of the same kind and of a value equal to or less than that paid in connection with the appraisal event; or b. Directly or indirectly has, or at any time in the 1-year period immediately preceding approval of the appraisal event had, the power, contractually or otherwise, to cause the appointment or election of any senior executives or managers of the limited liability company; or 2. Any of the members’ interests in the limited liability company or the limited liability company’s assets are being acquired or converted, whether by merger, conversion, or otherwise, pursuant to the appraisal event by a person, or by an affiliate of a person, who is or at any time in the 1-year period immediately preceding approval of the appraisal event was a senior executive of the limited liability company or a senior executive of any affiliate of the limited liability company, and that senior executive will receive, as a result of the limited liability company action, a financial benefit not generally available to members, other than: a. Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established separately and not as part, or in contemplation, of the appraisal event; b. Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established in contemplation, or as part, of the appraisal event which are not more favorable than those existing before the appraisal event or, if more favorable, which have been approved by the limited liability company; or c. In the case of a manager of the limited liability company who will, during or as the result of the appraisal event, become a manager, general partner, or director of the surviving or converted entity or one of its affiliates, those rights and benefits as a manager, general partner, or director which are provided on the same basis as those afforded by the surviving or converted entity generally to other managers, general partners, or directors of the surviving or converted entity or its affiliate. (e) For the purposes of sub-subparagraph (d)1.a., the term “beneficial owner” means a person who, directly or indirectly, through a contract, arrangement, or understanding, other than a revocable proxy, has or shares the right to vote or to direct the voting of an interest in a limited liability company with respect to approval of the appraisal event; however, a member of a national securities exchange may not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of an interest in a limited liability company held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because the member is the record holder of interests in the limited liability company if the member is precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instruction on contested matters or matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of the holders of the interests in the limited liability company to be voted. If two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of voting such interests, each member of the group formed thereby is deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, as of the date of such agreement, of all voting interests in the limited liability company beneficially owned by a member or members of the group.

(b) The person does not have interest holder liability for any debt, obligation, or other liability that arises after the conversion becomes effective. (c) The organic law of the jurisdiction of formation of the converting limited liability company and the rights of contribution provided under such law, or the organic rules of the converting limited liability company, continue to apply to the release, collection, or discharge of any interest holder liability preserved under paragraph (a) as if the conversion had not occurred. (5) When a conversion becomes effective, a foreign entity that is the converted entity may be served with process in this state for the collection and enforcement of its debts, obligations, and liabilities as provided in s. 605.0117 and chapter 48. (6) If the converting entity is a registered foreign entity, the certificate of authority to conduct business in this state of the converting entity is canceled when the conversion becomes effective. (7) A conversion does not require the entity to wind up its affairs and does not constitute or cause the dissolution of the entity. History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.

(2) A member who has complied with subsection (1) may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the limited liability company in writing by the date provided in the appraisal notice pursuant to s. 605.1065(2)(b)7. A member who fails to notify the limited liability company in writing of the withdrawal by the date provided in the appraisal notice may not thereafter withdraw without the limited liability company’s written consent.

(4) If the member’s right to receive fair value is terminated other than by the purchase of the membership interest by the limited liability company, all rights of the member, with respect to such membership interest, shall be reinstated effective as of the date the member delivered the items required by subsection (1), including the right to receive any intervening payment or other distribution with respect to such membership interest, or, if any such rights have expired or any such distribution other than a cash payment has been completed, in lieu thereof at the election of the limited liability company, the fair value thereof in cash as determined by the limited liability company as of the time of such expiration or completion, but without prejudice otherwise to any action or proceeding of the limited liability company that may have been taken by the limited liability company on or after the date the member delivered the items required by subsection (1).

If the limited liability company does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, any member who has made a demand pursuant to s. 605.1068 may commence the proceeding in the name of the limited liability company.

If by virtue of the appraisal event becoming effective the entity has become a foreign entity without a registered agent in this state, the proceeding must be commenced in the county in this state in which the principal office or registered agent of the limited liability company was located immediately before the time the appraisal event became effective; if it has, and immediately before the appraisal event became effective had no principal office in this state, then in the county in which the limited liability company has, or immediately before the time the appraisal event became effective had, an office in this state; or if none in this state, then in the county in which the limited liability company’s registered office is or was last located.

The limited liability company shall serve a copy of the initial pleading in such proceeding upon each member-party who is a resident of this state in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons and complaint and upon each nonresident member-party by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. (4) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (2) is plenary and exclusive. If it so elects, the court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have the powers described in the order appointing them or in an amendment to the order. The members demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. There is no right to a jury trial. (5) Each member who is made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount of the fair value of such member’s membership interests, plus interest, as found by the court. (6) The limited liability company shall pay each such member the amount found to be due within 10 days after final determination of the proceedings.

The interrogatories must be answered within 30 days after the date of mailing, or within such additional time as fixed by the department. The answers to the interrogatories must be full and complete and must be made in writing and under oath. If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they must be answered by the individual, and if directed to a limited liability company or foreign limited liability company, they must be answered by a manager of a manager-managed company, a member of a member-managed company, or other applicable governor if a foreign limited liability company is not member-managed or manager managed, or a fiduciary if the company is in the hands of a receiver, trustee, or other court-appointed fiduciary. (2) The department need not file a record in a court of competent jurisdiction to which the interrogatories relate until the interrogatories are answered as provided in this chapter, and is not required to file a record if the answers disclose that the record is not in conformity with the requirements of this chapter or if the department has determined that the parties to such document have not paid all fees, taxes, and penalties due and owing this state. The department shall certify to the Department of Legal Affairs, for such action as the Department of Legal Affairs may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers that disclose a violation of this chapter. (3) The department may, based upon its findings under this section or as provided in s. 213.053(15), bring an action in circuit court to collect any penalties, fees, or taxes determined to be due and owing the state and to compel any filing, qualification, or registration required by law. In connection with such proceeding, the department may, without prior approval by the court, file a lis pendens against any property owned by the limited liability company and may further certify any findings to the Department of Legal Affairs for the initiation of an action permitted pursuant to this chapter which the Department of Legal Affairs may deem appropriate.
