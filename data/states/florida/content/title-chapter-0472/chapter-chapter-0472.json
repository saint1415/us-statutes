      "text": "472.007 Board of Professional Surveyors and Mappers.—There is created in the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services the Board of Professional Surveyors and Mappers. (1) The board shall consist of nine members, seven of whom shall be registered surveyors and mappers primarily engaged in the practice of surveying and mapping and two of whom shall be laypersons who are not and have never been surveyors and mappers or members of any closely related profession or occupation. (2) Members shall be appointed by the Commissioner of Agriculture, subject to confirmation by the Senate. (a) Members shall be appointed for 4-year terms, and such terms shall expire on October 31. However, a term of less than 4 years may be used to ensure that no more than 3 members’ terms expire during the same calendar year. (b) A member whose term has expired shall continue to serve on the board until such time as a replacement is appointed. A vacancy on the board must be filled for the unexpired portion of the term in the same manner as the original appointment. A member may not serve for more than the remaining portion of a previous member’s unexpired term plus two consecutive 4-year terms of the member’s own appointment thereafter. (3) The board shall annually elect from among its number a chairperson and vice chairperson. (4) The board shall meet at least once annually and may meet as often as is necessary. The chairperson or a quorum of the board have the authority to call other meetings. (a) A quorum is necessary for the conduct of official business by the board or any committee thereof. Unless otherwise provided by law, 51 percent or more of the appointed members of the board or any committee, when applicable, constitute a quorum. (b) The membership of committees of the board, except as otherwise authorized under this chapter, shall be composed of currently appointed members of the board. The vote of a majority of the members of the quorum is necessary for any official action by the board or committee. (c) Three consecutive unexcused absences or absences constituting 50 percent or more of the board’s meetings within any 12-month period shall cause the board membership of the member in question to become void, and the position shall be considered vacant. The board shall define unexcused absences by rule. (5) Unless otherwise provided by law, a board member or former board member serving on a probable cause panel must be compensated $50 for each day in attendance at an official meeting of the board and for each day participating in any other business involving the board. The board shall adopt a rule defining the phrase “other business involving the board.” However, the phrase may not routinely be defined to include telephone conference calls. A board member is also entitled to reimbursement for expenses pursuant to s. 112.061. Travel out of state requires the prior approval of the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee. (6) The department and the board may advise licensees periodically, through the publication of a newsletter, of information that the department or the board determines is of interest to the industry. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the department and the board shall publish a summary of final orders resulting in fines, suspensions, or revocations, and any other information the department or the board determines is of interest to the public. (7)(a) Each board member is accountable to the commissioner for the proper performance of his or her duties as a member of the board. The commissioner shall investigate any legally sufficient complaint or unfavorable written report received by the commissioner or by the department or the board concerning the actions of the board or its individual members. The commissioner may suspend from office any board member for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform the member’s official duties, or commission of a felony. (b) Each board member and each former board member serving on a probable cause panel is exempt from civil liability for any act or omission committed while acting in the member’s official capacity. The department shall defend any member in any action against the board or a member of the board. In addition, the department may defend the member’s company or business in any action against the company or business if the department determines that the actions from which the suit arises are actions taken by the member in the member’s official capacity and were within the scope of the member’s statutory authority. In providing such defense, the department may employ or use the legal services of the Department of Legal Affairs or outside counsel retained pursuant to s. 287.059. Fees and costs of providing legal services under this subsection shall be paid from the General Inspection Trust Fund, subject to ss. 215.37 and 472.011.

This specific grant of rulemaking authority to the board shall be exercised only through proceedings pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 and with the prior approval of the department. (2) The board shall adopt rules authorizing the use of professional titles by retired surveyors and mappers. Such rules shall establish guidelines designed to avoid abuse by retirees and confusion on the part of the general public. The rules shall not require continuing education requirements in order to use a professional title by a retiree. (3) The department has standing to challenge any rule or proposed rule of the board pursuant to s. 120.56. In addition to challenges for any invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority, the administrative law judge, upon such a challenge by the department, may declare all or part of a rule or proposed rule invalid if it: (a) Does not protect the public from any significant and discernible harm or damages; (b) Unreasonably restricts competition or the availability of professional services in the state or in a significant part of the state; or (c) Unnecessarily increases the cost of professional services without a corresponding or equivalent public benefit. A presumption is not created for the existence of any of the conditions cited in this subsection if the department challenges the rule or proposed rule. (4) The department or the board is a substantially interested party for purposes of s. 120.54(7). The board may, as an adversely affected party, initiate and maintain an action pursuant to s. 120.68 challenging final agency action. (5) Any proposed board rule that has not been modified to remove proposed committee objections of the Administrative Procedures Committee must receive approval from the department before filing the rule with the Department of State for final adoption. The department may repeal any rule enacted by the board which has taken effect without having met proposed committee objections of the Administrative Procedures Committee.

The board may also establish by rule a delinquency fee. The board shall establish fees that are adequate to ensure the continued operation of the board. Fees shall be based on department estimates of the revenue required to implement ss. 472.001-472.037 and the provisions of law with respect to the regulation of surveyors and mappers. If the department determines, based on estimates of available revenue collected pursuant to this section, that the General Inspection Trust Fund contains funds that exceed the amount required to cover the necessary functions of the board, the department shall, by rule, waive the license renewal fees for licensees under this chapter for a period not to exceed 2 years. (2) The initial application and examination fee shall not exceed $125 plus the actual per applicant cost to the department to purchase the examination from the National Council of Engineering Examiners or a similar national organization. The examination fee shall be in an amount which covers the cost of obtaining and administering the examination and shall be refunded if the applicant is found ineligible to sit for the examination. The application fee shall be nonrefundable. (3) The initial license fee shall not exceed $200. (4) The fee for a certificate of authorization shall not exceed $125. (5) The biennial renewal fee shall not exceed $500. (6) The fee for a temporary registration or certificate to practice surveying and mapping may not exceed $100 for an individual or $200 for a business firm. (7) The fee for licensure by endorsement shall not exceed $200. (8) The fee for application for inactive status or for reactivation of an inactive license shall not exceed $150. (9) The fee for applications from providers of continuing education may not exceed $500. (10) All funds collected under this section, and the amount paid for licenses, fines, and fees, shall be deposited into the General Inspection Trust Fund of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. (11) If sufficient action is not taken by the board within 1 year after notification by the department that license fees are projected to be inadequate, the department shall set license fees on behalf of the board to cover anticipated costs and to maintain the required cash balance. Further, it is the legislative intent that this regulated profession not operate with a negative cash balance. The department may provide by rule for the advancement of sufficient funds if this profession is operating with a negative cash balance. Such advancement may be for a period not to exceed 2 consecutive years and shall require interest to be paid by the regulated profession. Interest shall be calculated at the current rate earned on General Inspection Trust Fund investments. Interest earned shall be allocated to the various funds in accordance with the allocation of investment earnings during the period of the advance. (12) The board may, by rule, assess and collect a special assessment from each active, inactive, and delinquent licensee in an amount necessary to eliminate a cash deficit or, if there is not a cash deficit, in an amount sufficient to maintain the financial integrity of this profession as required in this subsection. (13) The department may contract with public and private entities to receive and deposit revenue pursuant to this section. The Legislature shall appropriate funds from the General Inspection Trust Fund sufficient to carry out the provisions of this chapter. To the maximum extent possible, the department shall directly charge all expenses under this chapter to the account of the regulated profession. For the purpose of this subsection, direct charge expenses shall include, but not be limited to, costs for investigations, examinations, and legal services. The department shall maintain adequate records to support its allocation of department expenses. The department shall provide the board with reasonable access to these records upon request. The board shall be provided an annual report of revenue and direct and allocated expenses related to the operation of the profession. These reports shall be used by the board to determine the amount of license fees. (14) A condensed management report of budgets, finances, performance statistics, and recommendations shall be provided to the board at least once a quarter. The department shall identify and include in such presentations any changes, or projected changes, made to the board’s budget since the last presentation. (15) If a duplicate license is required or requested by a licensee, the board may charge a fee as determined by rule not to exceed $25 before issuing a duplicate license. (16) The department or the board shall charge a fee not to exceed $25 for the certification of a public record. The fee shall be determined by rule of the department. The department or the appropriate board shall assess a fee for duplication of a public record as provided in s. 119.07(4).

The applicant shall supplement his or her application as needed to reflect any material change in any circumstance or condition stated in the application which takes place between the initial filing of the application and the final grant or denial of the license and which might affect the decision of the department. An application is received for the purposes of s. 120.60 upon receipt by the department of the application, submitted in the format prescribed by the department, the application fee set by the board, and any other documentation or fee required by law or rule to be submitted with the application in order for the application to be complete. (2) The department shall license any applicant who the board certifies is qualified to practice surveying and mapping. (3)(a) Before the issuance of any license, the department may charge an initial license fee as determined by rule of the board. Upon receipt of the appropriate license fee, except as provided in subsection (6), the department shall issue a license to any person certified by the board, or its designee, as having met the applicable requirements imposed by law or rule. However, an applicant who is not otherwise qualified for licensure is not entitled to licensure solely based on a passing score on a required examination. (b) The department shall waive the initial license fee for an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Armed Forces, the spouse or surviving spouse of such a veteran, a current member of the United States Armed Forces who has served on active duty or the spouse of such a member, the surviving spouse of a member of the United States Armed Forces who died while serving on active duty, or a business entity that has a majority ownership held by such a veteran or spouse or surviving spouse if the department receives an application in a format prescribed by the department. The application format must include the applicant’s signature, under penalty of perjury, and supporting documentation. To qualify for the waiver: 1. A veteran must provide to the department a copy of his or her DD Form 214, as issued by the United States Department of Defense, or another acceptable form of identification as specified by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs; 2. The spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran must provide to the department a copy of the veteran’s DD Form 214, as issued by the United States Department of Defense, or another acceptable form of identification as specified by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and a copy of a valid marriage license or certificate verifying that he or she was lawfully married to the veteran at the time of discharge; or 3. A business entity must provide to the department proof that a veteran or the spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran holds a majority ownership in the business, a copy of the veteran’s DD Form 214, as issued by the United States Department of Defense, or another acceptable form of identification as specified by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and, if applicable, a copy of a valid marriage license or certificate verifying that the spouse or surviving spouse of the veteran was lawfully married to the veteran at the time of discharge. (4) The board shall certify for licensure any applicant who satisfies the requirements of s. 472.013 and who has passed the licensing examination. The board may refuse to certify any applicant who has violated any of the provisions of s. 472.031. (5)(a) The board shall certify as qualified for a license by endorsement an applicant who, at the time of application: 1. Holds a valid license to practice surveying and mapping issued before July 1, 1999, by another state or territory of the United States; has passed a national, regional, state, or territorial licensing examination that is substantially equivalent to the examination required by s. 472.013; and has a specific experience record of at least 8 years as a subordinate to a registered surveyor and mapper in the active practice of surveying and mapping, 6 years of which must be of a nature indicating that the applicant was in responsible charge of the accuracy and correctness of the surveying and mapping work performed; or 2. Holds a valid license to practice surveying and mapping issued by another state or territory of the United States if the criteria for issuance of the license were substantially the same as the licensure criteria that existed in Florida at the time the license was issued. (b) All applicants for licensure by endorsement must pass the Florida law and rules portion of the examination prior to licensure. (6)(a) The board may refuse to issue an initial license to any applicant who is under investigation or prosecution in any jurisdiction for an action that would constitute a violation of this chapter until such time as the investigation or prosecution is complete. (b) The department may not issue a license by endorsement to any applicant who is under investigation in this state or any other state or any other jurisdiction for any act that would constitute a violation of this chapter until the investigation is complete and disciplinary proceedings have been terminated. (7) When any administrative law judge conducts a hearing pursuant to chapter 120 with respect to the issuance of a license by the department, the administrative law judge shall submit his or her recommended order to the board, which shall thereupon issue a final order. The applicant for a license may appeal the final order of the board in accordance with the provisions of chapter 120. (8) A privilege against civil liability is hereby granted to any witness for any information furnished by the witness in any proceeding pursuant to this section, unless the witness acted in bad faith or with malice in providing such information. (9) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any elected official who is licensed under this chapter may hold employment for compensation with any public agency concurrent with such public service. Such dual service must be disclosed according to any disclosure required by applicable law. (10) In any instance in which a licensee or applicant to the department is required to be in compliance with a particular provision by, on, or before a certain date, and if that date occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the licensee or applicant is deemed to be in compliance with the specific date requirement if the required action occurs on the first succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. (11) Any submission required to be in writing may otherwise be required by the department to be made by electronic means. (12) A licensee or business entity that meets the requirements of this section or s. 472.021 must carry professional liability insurance or provide notice to any person or entity to which surveying and mapping services are offered that the licensee or business entity does not carry professional liability insurance. The notice must consist of a sign prominently displayed in the reception area and written statements provided in a form and frequency as required by rule of the Board of Professional Surveyors and Mappers. (13) The department may revoke the license of a licensee or business entity that fails to pay a final judgment in connection with the provision of, or failure to provide, services under this chapter. (14) A person may not be disqualified from practicing surveying or mapping as regulated by the state solely because he or she is not a United States citizen. (15) Pursuant to the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, each person applying for initial licensure or license renewal shall provide his or her social security number. Use of social security numbers obtained through this requirement is limited to the purpose of administering the Title IV-D program for child support enforcement, use by the department, and use as otherwise provided by law.

The board may provide by rule for continuing education hours carryover for each renewal cycle not to exceed 12 hours. (1) The board shall adopt rules to establish the criteria for continuing education providers. The rules may provide that up to a maximum of 25 percent of the required continuing education hours may be fulfilled by the performance of pro bono services to the indigent or to underserved populations or in areas of critical need within the state where the licensee practices. The board must require that any pro bono services be approved in advance in order to receive credit for continuing education under this section. The board shall use the standard recognized by the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines produced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in determining indigency. The board may adopt rules that may provide that a part of the continuing education hours may be fulfilled by performing research in critical need areas or for training leading to advanced professional certification. The board may adopt rules to define underserved and critical need areas. The department shall adopt rules for the administration of continuing education requirements adopted by the board. (2) The board may provide by rule the method of delivery and criteria that may be used to satisfy continuing education requirements. (3) The board may prorate the required continuing education hours in the following circumstances: (a) For new licensees: 1. By requiring half of the required continuing education hours for any applicant who becomes licensed with more than half the renewal period remaining and no continuing education for any applicant who becomes licensed with half or less than half of the renewal period remaining; or 2. Requiring no continuing education hours until the first full renewal cycle of the licensee. (b) When the number of hours required is increased by law or the board. (4) Upon the request of a licensee, the provider must also furnish to the department information regarding courses completed by the licensee, in an electronic format required by rule of the department. (5) Each continuing education provider shall retain all records relating to a licensee’s completion of continuing education courses for at least 4 years after completion of a course. (6) A continuing education provider may not be approved, and the approval may not be renewed, unless the provider agrees in writing to provide such cooperation under this section as required by the department. (7) For the purpose of determining which persons or entities must meet the reporting, recordkeeping, and access provisions of this section, the board by rule shall adopt a definition of the term “continuing education provider” applicable to the profession’s continuing education requirements. The intent of the rule is to ensure that all records and information necessary to carry out the requirements of this section are maintained and transmitted accordingly and to minimize disputes as to what person or entity is responsible for maintaining and reporting such records and information. (8) The board shall approve the providers of continuing education. The approval of continuing education providers must be for a specified period of time, not to exceed 4 years. An approval that does not include such a time limitation may remain in effect under this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter. (9) The department may fine, suspend, or revoke approval of any continuing education provider that fails to comply with its duties under this section. The fine may not exceed $500 per violation. Investigations and prosecutions of a provider’s failure to comply with its duties under this section shall be conducted pursuant to s. 472.033. (10) The board shall issue an order requiring a person or entity to cease and desist from offering any continuing education programs for licensees, and fining, suspending, or revoking any approval of the provider previously granted by the board if the board determines that the person or entity failed to provide appropriate continuing education services. The fine may not exceed $500 per violation. Investigations and prosecutions of a provider’s failure to comply with its duties under this section shall be conducted under s. 472.033. (11) The board may establish, by rule, a fee not to exceed $250 for anyone seeking approval to provide continuing education courses and may establish, by rule, a biennial fee not to exceed $250 for the renewal of providership of such courses. Such postlicensure education courses are subject to the reporting, monitoring, and compliance provisions of this section. (12) The department and the board may adopt rules under ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to administer this section. (13) Each continuing education provider shall provide to the department, in an electronic format determined by the department, information regarding the continuing education status of licensees which the department determines is necessary to carry out its duties under this chapter. After a licensee completes a course, the information must be submitted electronically by the continuing education provider to the department within 30 calendar days after completion. However, beginning on the 30th day before the renewal deadline or before the renewal date, whichever occurs sooner, the continuing education provider shall electronically report such information to the department within 10 business days after completion. (14) The department shall establish a system to monitor licensee compliance with continuing education requirements and to determine the continuing education status of each licensee. As used in this subsection, the term “monitor” means the act of determining, for each licensee, whether the licensee is in full compliance with applicable continuing education requirements as of the date of the licensee’s application for license renewal. (15) The department may refuse to renew a license until the licensee has satisfied all applicable continuing education requirements. This subsection does not preclude the department or board from imposing additional penalties pursuant to this chapter or rules adopted pursuant this chapter.

A licensee who practices a profession without an active status license is in violation of this section and s. 472.0351, and the board may impose discipline on the licensee. (2) The board shall permit a licensee to choose, at the time of licensure renewal, an active or inactive status. However, a licensee who changes from inactive to active status is not eligible to return to inactive status until the licensee thereafter completes a licensure cycle on active status. (3) The board, by rule, shall impose a fee for an inactive status license which is no greater than the fee for an active status license. (4) An inactive status licensee may change to active status at any time, provided the licensee meets all requirements for active status, pays any additional licensure fees necessary to equal those imposed on an active status licensee, pays any applicable reactivation fees as set by the board, and meets all continuing education requirements as specified in this section. (5) A licensee shall apply with a complete application, as defined by rule of the board, to renew an active or inactive status license before the license expires. Failure of a licensee to renew before the license expires shall cause the license to become delinquent in the license cycle following expiration. (6)(a) A delinquent status licensee must affirmatively apply with a complete application, as defined by rule of the board, for active or inactive status during the licensure cycle in which a licensee becomes delinquent. Failure by a delinquent status licensee to become active or inactive before the expiration of the current licensure cycle shall render the license void without any further action by the board or the department. (b) Notwithstanding this chapter, the board may, at its discretion, reinstate the license of an individual whose license has become void if the board determines that the individual has made a good faith effort to comply with this section but has failed to comply because of illness or unusual hardship. The individual must apply to the board for reinstatement in a manner prescribed by rules of the board and shall pay an applicable fee in an amount determined by rule. The board shall require that such individual meet all continuing education requirements prescribed by law, pay appropriate licensing fees, and otherwise be eligible for renewal of licensure under this chapter. (7) The board, by rule, shall impose an additional delinquency fee, not to exceed the biennial renewal fee for an active status license, on a delinquent status licensee when such licensee applies for active or inactive status. (8) The board, by rule, shall impose an additional fee, not to exceed the biennial renewal fee for an active status license, for processing a licensee’s request to change licensure status at any time other than at the beginning of a licensure cycle. (9) The board, by rule, may impose reasonable conditions, excluding full reexamination but including part of a national examination or a special purpose examination to assess current competency, necessary to ensure that a licensee who has been on inactive status for more than two consecutive biennial licensure cycles and who applies for active status can practice with the care and skill sufficient to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Reactivation requirements may differ depending on the length of time licensees are inactive. The costs to meet reactivation requirements shall be borne by licensees requesting reactivation. (10) Before reactivation, an inactive or delinquent licensee shall meet the same continuing education requirements, if any, imposed on an active status licensee for all biennial licensure periods in which the licensee was inactive or delinquent. (11) The status or a change in status of a licensee does not alter the board’s right to impose discipline or to enforce discipline previously imposed on a licensee for acts or omissions committed by the licensee while holding a license, whether active, inactive, or delinquent.

All final drawings, specifications, plans, reports, or other papers or documents involving the practice of surveying and mapping which are prepared or approved for the use of the corporation or partnership or for delivery to any person or for public record within the state must be dated and must bear the signature and seal of the registrant who prepared or approved them. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a corporation to hold a certificate of registration to practice surveying and mapping. No corporation or partnership shall be relieved of responsibility for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, or officers by reason of its compliance with this section, nor shall any individual practicing surveying and mapping be relieved of responsibility for professional services performed by reason of his or her employment or relationship with a corporation or partnership. (2) For the purposes of this section, a certificate of authorization shall be required for a corporation, partnership, association, or person practicing under a fictitious name, offering surveying and mapping services to the public; however, when an individual is practicing surveying and mapping in his or her own given name, he or she shall not be required to register under this section. (3) Except as provided in s. 558.0035, the fact that any registered surveyor and mapper practices through a corporation or partnership does not relieve the registrant from personal liability for negligence, misconduct, or wrongful acts committed by him or her. Partnerships and all partners shall be jointly and severally liable for the negligence, misconduct, or wrongful acts committed by their agents, employees, or partners while acting in a professional capacity. An officer, agent, or employee of a business organization other than a partnership shall be personally liable and accountable only for negligent acts, wrongful acts, or misconduct committed by him or her or committed by a person under his or her direct supervision and control while rendering professional services on behalf of the business organization. The personal liability of a shareholder or owner of a business organization, in his or her capacity as shareholder or owner, shall be no greater than that of a shareholder-employee of a corporation incorporated under chapter 607. The business organization shall be liable up to the full value of its property for any negligent acts, wrongful acts, or misconduct committed by any of its officers, agents, or employees while they are engaged on its behalf in the rendering of professional services. (4) Each certification of authorization shall be renewed every 2 years. Each partnership and corporation certified under this section shall notify the board within 1 month of any change in the information contained in the application upon which the certification is based. (5) Disciplinary action against a corporation or partnership shall be administered in the same manner and on the same grounds as disciplinary action against a registered surveyor and mapper.

When a certificate of registration has been revoked or suspended by the board, the registrant shall, within 30 days after the revocation or suspension has become effective, surrender his or her seal to the executive director of the board and confirm to the executive director the cancellation of the registrant’s digital signature in accordance with ss. 668.001-668.006. If the registrant’s certificate has been suspended for a period of time, his or her seal shall be returned to him or her upon expiration of the suspension period.

Entry under the right granted by this subsection does not constitute trespass, and surveyors and mappers and their duly authorized agents or employees so entering are not liable to arrest or to a civil action by reason of such entry; however, this subsection does not give authority to registrants, subordinates, agents, or employees to destroy, injure, damage, or move any physical improvements on lands of another without the written permission of the landowner. (2) LIABILITY AND DUTY OF CARE ON AGRICULTURAL LAND.— (a) Any person regulated by this chapter who enters agricultural land shall do so in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to premises security, agricultural protections, and other health and safety requirements in place on such land. (b) A landowner is not liable to any third party for civil or criminal acts or damages that result from the negligent or intentional conduct of any person regulated by this chapter on agricultural land. (c) If written notice is not delivered to the landowner or landowner’s registered agent at least 3 business days prior to entry on an agricultural parcel containing more than 160 acres, the duty of care owed by the landowner to those regulated by this chapter is that due an undiscovered trespasser.

      "text": "472.033 Disciplinary proceedings.—Disciplinary proceedings for the board shall be within the jurisdiction of the department. (1)(a) The department shall investigate any complaint that is filed before it if the complaint is in writing, signed by the complainant, and legally sufficient. A complaint is legally sufficient if it contains ultimate facts that show that a violation of this chapter or of any rule adopted by the department or the board has occurred. In order to determine legal sufficiency, the department may require supporting information or documentation. The department may investigate, and the department or the board may take appropriate final action on, a complaint even though the original complainant withdraws it or otherwise indicates a desire not to cause the complaint to be investigated or prosecuted to completion. The department may investigate an anonymous complaint if the complaint is in writing and is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rules is substantial, and if the department has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the violations alleged in the complaint are true. The department may investigate a complaint made by a confidential informant if the complaint is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rule is substantial, and if the department has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the allegations of the complainant are true. The department may initiate an investigation if it has reasonable cause to believe that a licensee or a group of licensees has violated a Florida statute, a rule of the department, or a rule of the board. (b) If an investigation of any subject is undertaken, the department shall promptly furnish to the subject or the subject’s attorney a copy of the complaint or document that resulted in the initiation of the investigation. The subject may submit a written response to the information contained in such complaint or document within 20 days after service to the subject of the complaint or document. The subject’s written response shall be considered by the probable cause panel. The right to respond does not prohibit the issuance of a summary emergency order if necessary to protect the public. However, if the commissioner, or the commissioner’s designee, and the chair of the respective board or the chair of its probable cause panel agree in writing that such notification would be detrimental to the investigation, the department may withhold notification. The department may conduct an investigation without notification to any subject if the act under investigation is a criminal offense. (2) The department shall allocate sufficient and adequately trained staff to expeditiously and thoroughly determine legal sufficiency and investigate all legally sufficient complaints. When its investigation is complete and legally sufficient, the department shall prepare and submit to the probable cause panel of the board the investigative report of the department. The report shall contain the investigative findings and the recommendations of the department concerning the existence of probable cause. At any time after legal sufficiency is found, the department may dismiss any case, or any part thereof, if the department determines that there is insufficient evidence to support the prosecution of allegations contained therein. The department shall provide a detailed report to the appropriate probable cause panel before dismissing any case or part thereof, and to the subject of the complaint after dismissal of any case or part thereof, under this section. For cases dismissed before a finding of probable cause, such report is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1). The probable cause panel shall have access, upon request, to the investigative files pertaining to a case before dismissing the case. (3)(a) As an alternative to subsections (1) and (2), if a complaint is received, the department may provide a licensee with a notice of noncompliance for an initial offense of a minor violation. A violation is a minor violation if it does not demonstrate a serious inability to practice the profession, result in economic or physical harm to a person, or adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare or create a significant threat of such harm. The board shall establish by rule those violations which are minor violations under this provision. Failure of a licensee to take action in correcting the violation within 15 days after notice may result in the institution of regular disciplinary proceedings. (b) The department may issue a notice of noncompliance for an initial offense of a minor violation, notwithstanding the board’s failure to designate a particular minor violation by rule as provided in paragraph (a). (4) The determination as to whether probable cause exists shall be made by majority vote of a probable cause panel of the board, or by the department, as appropriate. The board shall provide by rule that the determination of probable cause shall be made by a panel of its members or by the department. The board may provide by rule for multiple probable cause panels composed of at least two members. The board may provide by rule that one or more members of the panel or panels may be a former board member. The length of term or repetition of service of any such former board member on a probable cause panel may vary according to the direction of the board when authorized by board rule. Any probable cause panel must include one of the board’s former or present consumer members, if one is available, willing to serve, and is authorized to do so by the board chair. Any probable cause panel must include a present board member. Any probable cause panel must include a former or present professional board member. However, any former professional board member serving on the probable cause panel must hold an active valid license for that profession. All proceedings of the panel are exempt from s. 286.011 until 10 days after probable cause has been found to exist by the panel or until the subject of the investigation waives his or her privilege of confidentiality. The probable cause panel may make a reasonable request, and upon such request the department shall provide such additional investigative information as is necessary to the determination of probable cause. A request for additional investigative information shall be made within 15 days from the date of receipt by the probable cause panel of the investigative report of the department. The probable cause panel or the department, as may be appropriate, shall make its determination of probable cause within 30 days after receipt by it of the final investigative report of the department. The commissioner or the commissioner’s designee may grant extensions of the 15-day and the 30-day time limits. In lieu of a finding of probable cause, the probable cause panel may issue a letter of guidance to the subject. If, within the 30-day time limit, as may be extended, the probable cause panel does not make a determination regarding the existence of probable cause or does not issue a letter of guidance in lieu of a finding of probable cause, the department, for disciplinary cases under its jurisdiction, must make a determination regarding the existence of probable cause within 10 days after the expiration of the time limit. If the probable cause panel finds that probable cause exists, it shall direct the department to file a formal complaint against the licensee. The department shall follow the directions of the probable cause panel regarding the filing of a formal complaint. If directed to do so, the department shall file a formal complaint against the subject of the investigation and prosecute that complaint pursuant to chapter 120. However, the department may decide not to prosecute the complaint if it finds that probable cause had been improvidently found by the panel. In such cases, the department shall refer the matter to the board. The board may then file a formal complaint and prosecute the complaint pursuant to chapter 120. The department shall also refer to the board any investigation or disciplinary proceeding not before the Division of Administrative Hearings pursuant to chapter 120 or otherwise completed by the department within 1 year after the filing of a complaint. The department, for disciplinary cases under its jurisdiction, must establish a uniform reporting system to quarterly refer to the board the status of any investigation or disciplinary proceeding that is not before the Division of Administrative Hearings or otherwise completed by the department within 1 year after the filing of the complaint. All proceedings of the probable cause panel are exempt from s. 120.525. (5) A formal hearing before an administrative law judge from the Division of Administrative Hearings shall be held pursuant to chapter 120 if there are any disputed issues of material fact. The administrative law judge shall issue a recommended order pursuant to chapter 120. If any party raises an issue of disputed fact during an informal hearing, the hearing shall be terminated and a formal hearing pursuant to chapter 120 shall be held. (6) The board, with those members of the panel, if any, who reviewed the investigation pursuant to subsection (4) being excused, shall determine and issue the final order in each disciplinary case. Such order shall constitute final agency action. Any consent order or agreed settlement shall be subject to the approval of the department. (7) The department has standing to seek judicial review of any final order of the board, pursuant to s. 120.68. (8) Any proceeding for the purpose of summary suspension of a license, or for the restriction of the license, of a licensee pursuant to s. 120.60(6) shall be conducted by the commissioner or the commissioner’s designee, who shall issue the final summary order. (9) The department shall periodically notify the person who filed the complaint of the status of the investigation, whether probable cause has been found, and the status of any civil action or administrative proceeding or appeal. (10) The complaint and all information obtained pursuant to the investigation by the department are confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) until 10 days after probable cause has been found to exist by the probable cause panel or by the department, or until the regulated professional or subject of the investigation waives his or her privilege of confidentiality, whichever occurs first. However, this exemption does not apply to actions against unlicensed persons pursuant to s. 472.036. Upon completion of the investigation and pursuant to a written request by the subject, the department shall provide the subject an opportunity to inspect the investigative file or, at the subject’s expense, forward to the subject a copy of the investigative file. The subject may file a written response to the information contained in the investigative file. Such response must be filed within 20 days, unless an extension of time has been granted by the department. This subsection does not prohibit the department from providing such information to any law enforcement agency or to any other regulatory agency.

If the circumstances of the violation meet that standard and 2 years have passed since the issuance of a final order imposing discipline, the department shall reclassify that violation as inactive if the licensee has not been disciplined for any subsequent minor violation of the same nature. After the department has reclassified the violation as inactive, it is no longer considered to be part of the licensee’s disciplinary record, and the licensee may lawfully deny or fail to acknowledge the incident as a disciplinary action. (2) The department may establish a schedule classifying violations according to the severity of the violation. After the expiration of set periods of time, the department may provide for such disciplinary records to become inactive, according to their classification. After the disciplinary record has become inactive, the department may clear the violation from the disciplinary record and the subject person or business may lawfully deny or fail to acknowledge such disciplinary actions.

The acceptance of a relinquishment of licensure, stipulation, consent order, or other settlement offered in response to or in anticipation of the filing of charges against the license by a licensing authority is an action against the license; (d) Being convicted or found guilty of, or entering a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, a crime in any jurisdiction which directly relates to the practice of surveying and mapping or the ability to practice surveying and mapping; (e) Making or filing a report or record that the licensee knows to be false, willfully failing to file a report or record required by state or federal law, willfully impeding or obstructing such filing, or inducing another person to impede or obstruct such filing. Such reports or records include only those that are signed in the capacity of a registered surveyor and mapper; (f) Advertising goods or services in a manner that is fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading in form or content; (g) Upon proof that the licensee is guilty of fraud or deceit, or of negligence, incompetency, or misconduct, in the practice of surveying and mapping; (h) Failing to perform a statutory or legal obligation placed upon a licensed surveyor and mapper; violating a provision of this chapter, a rule of the board or department, or a lawful order of the board or department; or failing to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena of the department; (i) Practicing on a revoked, suspended, inactive, or delinquent license; (j) Having been found liable in a civil proceeding for knowingly filing a false report or complaint with the department against another licensee; (k) Failing to report to the department any person who the licensee knows is in violation of this chapter or the rules of the department or the board; (l) Aiding, assisting, procuring, employing, or advising any unlicensed person or entity to practice surveying and mapping contrary to this chapter or the rules of the department or the board; (m) Making deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in or related to the practice of professional surveying or mapping or employing a trick or scheme in or related to the practice of professional surveying or mapping; (n) Exercising influence on the client for the purpose of financial gain of the licensee or a third party; (o) Practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope permitted by law or accepting and performing professional responsibilities the licensee knows, or has reason to know, the licensee is not competent to perform; (p) Delegating or contracting for the performance of professional responsibilities by a person when the licensee delegating or contracting for performance of such responsibilities knows, or has reason to know, such person is not qualified by training, experience, and authorization when required to perform them; or (q) Improperly interfering with an investigation or inspection authorized by statute, or with any disciplinary proceeding. (2) If the board finds a surveyor or mapper guilty of any of the grounds set forth in subsection (1) or a violation of this chapter which occurred before obtaining a license, the board may enter an order imposing one or more of the following penalties: (a) Denial of an application for licensure, or approval of an application for licensure with restrictions. (b) Revocation or suspension of a license. (c) Imposition of an administrative fine in the Class I category pursuant to s. 570.971 for each count or separate offense. (d) Issuance of a reprimand.

(f) Restriction of the authorized scope of practice by the surveyor or mapper. (g) Corrective action. (3) The department shall reissue the license of a disciplined surveyor or mapper upon certification by the board that he or she has complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the final order. (4)(a) In addition to any other discipline imposed pursuant to this section, the board may assess costs and attorney fees related to the investigation and prosecution of the case. (b) In any case where the board or the department imposes a fine or assessment and the fine or assessment is not paid within a reasonable time, which may be prescribed in the rules of the board or in the order assessing such fines or costs, the department or the Department of Legal Affairs may contract for the collection of, or bring a civil action to recover, the fine or assessment. (c) The department may not issue to or renew the license of any person or business entity against which the board has assessed a fine, interest, costs, or attorney fees associated with an investigation and prosecution until the person or business entity has paid the full amount due or complies with or satisfies all terms and conditions of the final order. (5) If the board determines that revocation of a license is the appropriate penalty, the revocation shall be permanent. However, the board may establish, by rule, requirements for reapplication by applicants whose licenses have been permanently revoked. Such requirements may include, but are not limited to, satisfying current requirements for an initial license. History.—s. 26, ch. 2009-66; s. 13, ch. 2012-67; s. 13, ch. 2014-150.

The department shall include all financial and statistical data resulting from unlicensed activity enforcement as a separate category in the quarterly management report provided for in s. 472.011.

Fees shall be based on department estimates of the revenue required to implement ss. 472.001-472.037 and the provisions of law with respect to the regulation of surveyors and mappers. If the department determines, based on estimates of available revenue collected pursuant to this section, that the General Inspection Trust Fund contains funds that exceed the amount required to cover the necessary functions of the board, the department shall, by rule, waive the license renewal fees for licensees under this chapter for a period not to exceed 2 years. (2) The initial application and examination fee shall not exceed $125 plus the actual per applicant cost to the department to purchase the examination from the National Council of Engineering Examiners or a similar national organization. The examination fee shall be in an amount which covers the cost of obtaining and administering the examination and shall be refunded if the applicant is found ineligible to sit for the examination. The application fee shall be nonrefundable. (3) The initial license fee shall not exceed $200. (4) The fee for a certificate of authorization shall not exceed $125.

(11) If sufficient action is not taken by the board within 1 year after notification by the department that license fees are projected to be inadequate, the department shall set license fees on behalf of the board to cover anticipated costs and to maintain the required cash balance. Further, it is the legislative intent that this regulated profession not operate with a negative cash balance. The department may provide by rule for the advancement of sufficient funds if this profession is operating with a negative cash balance. Such advancement may be for a period not to exceed 2 consecutive years and shall require interest to be paid by the regulated profession. Interest shall be calculated at the current rate earned on General Inspection Trust Fund investments. Interest earned shall be allocated to the various funds in accordance with the allocation of investment earnings during the period of the advance. (12) The board may, by rule, assess and collect a special assessment from each active, inactive, and delinquent licensee in an amount necessary to eliminate a cash deficit or, if there is not a cash deficit, in an amount sufficient to maintain the financial integrity of this profession as required in this subsection. (13) The department may contract with public and private entities to receive and deposit revenue pursuant to this section. The Legislature shall appropriate funds from the General Inspection Trust Fund sufficient to carry out the provisions of this chapter. To the maximum extent possible, the department shall directly charge all expenses under this chapter to the account of the regulated profession. For the purpose of this subsection, direct charge expenses shall include, but not be limited to, costs for investigations, examinations, and legal services. The department shall maintain adequate records to support its allocation of department expenses. The department shall provide the board with reasonable access to these records upon request. The board shall be provided an annual report of revenue and direct and allocated expenses related to the operation of the profession. These reports shall be used by the board to determine the amount of license fees. (14) A condensed management report of budgets, finances, performance statistics, and recommendations shall be provided to the board at least once a quarter. The department shall identify and include in such presentations any changes, or projected changes, made to the board’s budget since the last presentation. (15) If a duplicate license is required or requested by a licensee, the board may charge a fee as determined by rule not to exceed $25 before issuing a duplicate license. (16) The department or the board shall charge a fee not to exceed $25 for the certification of a public record. The fee shall be determined by rule of the department. The department or the appropriate board shall assess a fee for duplication of a public record as provided in s. 119.07(4).
