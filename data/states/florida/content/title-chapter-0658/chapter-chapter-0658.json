In determining whether an applicant meets the requirements of this subsection, the office shall consider all materially relevant factors, including: (a) The purpose, objectives, and business philosophy of the proposed state bank or trust company. (b) The projected financial performance of the proposed bank or trust company. (c) The feasibility of the proposed bank or trust company, as stated in the business plan, particularly with respect to asset and liability growth and management. (2) The proposed capitalization is in such amount as the office deems adequate, but in no case may the total capital accounts at opening for a bank be less than $8 million. The total capital accounts at opening for a trust company may not be less than $3 million. The organizing directors of the proposed bank shall directly own or control at least the lesser of $3 million or 25 percent of the bank’s total capital accounts proposed at opening as approved by the office. When the proposed bank will be owned by a single-bank holding company, the organizing directors of the proposed bank collectively shall directly own or control at least an amount of the single-bank holding company’s capital accounts equal to the lesser of $3 million or 25 percent of the proposed bank’s total capital accounts proposed at opening as approved by the office. When the proposed bank will be owned by an existing multibank holding company, the proposed directors shall have a substantial capital investment in the holding company, as determined by the office; however, such investment shall not be required to exceed the amount otherwise required for a single-bank holding company application. The office may disallow illegally obtained currency, monetary instruments, funds, or other financial resources from the capitalization requirements of this section. The proposed stock offering must comply with the requirements of ss. 658.23-658.25 and 658.34-658.37. (3) The proposed capital structure is in such form as the office may require, but, at a minimum, every state bank or trust company hereafter organized shall establish paid-in capital equal in amount to not less than 50 percent of its total capital accounts and a paid-in surplus equal in amount to not less than 20 percent of its paid-in capital. (4)(a) The proposed officers have sufficient financial institution experience, ability, standing, and reputation and the proposed directors have sufficient business experience, ability, standing, and reputation to indicate reasonable promise of successful operation, and none of the proposed officers or directors has been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, any violation of s. 655.50, relating to the control of money laundering and terrorist financing; chapter 896, relating to offenses related to financial institutions; or similar state or federal law. (b) At least two of the proposed directors who are not also proposed officers must have had at least 1 year of direct experience as an executive officer, regulator, or director of a financial institution within the 5 years before the date of the application. However, if the applicant demonstrates that at least one of the proposed directors has very substantial experience as an executive officer, director, or regulator of a financial institution more than 5 years before the date of the application, the office may modify the requirement and allow the applicant to have only one director who has direct financial institution experience within the last 5 years. (c) The proposed president or chief executive officer must have had at least 1 year of direct experience as an executive officer, director, or regulator of a financial institution within the last 5 years. The office may waive this requirement after considering: 1. The adequacy of the overall experience and expertise of the proposed president or chief executive officer; 2. The likelihood of successful operation of the proposed state bank or trust company pursuant to subsection (1); 3. The adequacy of the proposed capitalization under subsection (2); 4. The proposed capital structure under subsection (3); 5. The experience of the other proposed officers and directors; and 6. Any other relevant data or information. (5) The corporate name of the proposed state bank or trust company is approved by the office. (6) Provision has been made for suitable quarters at the location in the application.

The sufficiency and quality of management available to operate the branch; 4. The name of the proposed branch to determine if it reasonably identifies the branch as a branch of the main office and is not likely to unduly confuse the public; and 5. Substantial compliance by the applicants with applicable law governing their operations. (e) A state bank that is not eligible for notification of a branch relocation must file an application in the form required by the commission. Upon the filing of a relocation application and a nonrefundable filing fee, the office shall investigate to determine whether the financial institution has substantially complied with applicable law governing its operations. Additional investments in land, buildings, leases, and leasehold improvements resulting from such relocation must comply with the limitations imposed by s. 658.67(7)(a). A main office may not be moved outside this state unless the move is expressly authorized by the financial institutions codes or by federal law. A financial institution that has been in operation for less than 24 months must provide evidence that the criteria of s. 658.21(1) will be met. (f) A branch office may be closed with 30 days’ prior written notice to the office. The notice shall include any information the commission prescribes by rule. (3) With prior written notification to the office, any bank may operate facilities which are not physically connected to the main or branch office of the bank, provided that the facilities are situated on the property of the main or branch office or property contiguous thereto. Property which is separated from the main or branch office of a bank by only a street, and one or more walkways and alleyways are determined to be, for purposes of this subsection, contiguous to the property of the main or branch office. (4) A bank may provide, directly or through a contract with another company, off-premises armored car service to its customers. Armored car services shall not be considered a branch for the purposes of subsection (2). (5)(a) Any state bank that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company may agree to receive deposits, renew time deposits, close loans, service loans, and receive payments on loans and other obligations, as an agent for an affiliated depository institution. (b) The term “close loan” does not include the making of a decision to extend credit or the extension of credit. (c) As used in this section, “receive deposits” means the taking of deposits to be credited to an existing account and does not include the opening or origination of new deposit accounts at an affiliated institution by the agent institution. (d) Under this section, affiliated banks may act as agents for one another regardless of whether the institutions are located in the same or different states. This section applies solely to affiliated depository institutions acting as agents, and has no application to agency relationships concerning nondepositories as agent, whether or not affiliated with the depository institution. (e) In addition, under this section, agent banks may perform ministerial functions for the principal bank making a loan. Ministerial functions include, but are not limited to, such activities as providing loan applications, assembling documents, providing a location for returning documents necessary for making the loan, providing loan account information, and receiving payments. It does not include such loan functions as evaluating applications or disbursing loan funds.

(a) The application must contain the name and address, and such other relevant information as the commission or office requires, including information relating to other and former addresses and the reputation, character, responsibility, and business affiliations of the proposed new owners of the controlling interest. (b) The office shall issue a certificate of approval only after it has made an investigation and determined that the proposed new owners of the interest are qualified by reputation, character, experience, and financial responsibility to control and operate the bank or trust company in a legal and proper manner and that the interests of the other stockholders, if any, the depositors and creditors of the bank or trust company, and the public generally will not be jeopardized by the proposed change in ownership, controlling interest, or management. (c) A person who has been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a violation of s. 655.50, relating to money laundering in financial institutions; chapter 896, relating to offenses related to financial transactions; or any similar state or federal law may not receive a certificate of approval. (d) A business organization that is not a bank holding company authorized by the office or the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, 12 U.S.C. ss. 1841 et seq., may not control a bank. (2) If a person or a group of persons, directly or indirectly, acquires a controlling interest in a state bank or state trust company, as contemplated by this section, through probate or trust, the person or group of persons shall notify the office within 90 days after acquiring such an interest. Such an interest does not give rise to a presumption of control until the person or group of persons votes the shares or the office has issued a certificate of approval in response to an application pursuant to subsection (1). (3) For the purposes of this section, the standards, criteria, and exceptions contained in s. 658.27(2), (3), (4), and (5) relating to control by a business organization of a bank or another business organization apply to the persons mentioned in this section and constitute the standards, criteria, and exceptions which determine whether any person or group of persons shall be deemed to be purchasing or acquiring, or to have purchased or acquired, directly or indirectly a “controlling interest” in a state bank or a state trust company; but the office is not limited to those standards or criteria in determining whether any such person shall be deemed to be acting by or through one or more other persons. (4) In any case in which a proposed purchase or acquisition of voting securities of a state bank or trust company would give rise to the presumption created under s. 658.27(2)(c), the person or group of persons who propose to purchase or acquire the voting securities shall first give written notice of the proposal to the office. Such notice may present information that the proposed purchase or acquisition will not result in control. The office shall afford the person seeking to rebut the presumption an opportunity to present views in writing or orally before its designated representatives at an informal conference. If the office determines, pursuant to the informal conference, that the person or group of persons seeking to rebut the presumption exercises a controlling influence over the bank, an application for change of control must be filed pursuant to this section. (5) For the purposes of this section, no person will be considered as having effected a change in control of any bank by the formation of a bank holding company when the person or persons who controlled the bank or banks are the same person or persons who control the holding company.

      "text": "658.2953 Interstate branching.— (1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Florida Interstate Branching Act.” (2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of interstate branching, in accordance with this section and consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. ss. 1811 et seq.; the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, 12 U.S.C. ss. 1841 et seq., and 12 U.S.C. s. 5451; and Pub. L. No. 111-203. (3) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term: (a) “Interstate merger transaction” means the merger or consolidation of banks with different home states, and the conversion of branches of any bank involved in the merger or consolidation into branches of the resulting bank. (b) “Resulting bank” means a bank that results from an interstate merger transaction under this section. (c) “Florida bank” means a bank whose home state is this state. (4) AUTHORITY OF STATE BANKS TO ESTABLISH INTERSTATE BRANCHES BY MERGER.—With the prior written approval of the office, a state bank may establish, maintain, and operate one or more branches in a state other than this state pursuant to an interstate merger transaction in which the state bank is the resulting bank. No later than the date on which the required application for the interstate merger transaction is filed with the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, the applicant state bank shall file an application on a form prescribed by the commission accompanied by the required fee pursuant to s. 658.73. The applicant must also comply with the provisions of ss. 658.40-658.45. (5) INTERSTATE MERGER TRANSACTIONS AND BRANCHING PERMITTED.— (a) One or more Florida banks may enter into an interstate merger transaction with one or more out-of-state banks. An out-of-state bank resulting from such transaction may maintain and operate the branches of a Florida bank that participated in such transaction if the conditions and filing requirements of this section are met. (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, an interstate merger transaction is not permitted if, upon consummation of such transaction, the resulting bank, including all insured depository institutions that would be affiliates, as defined in 12 U.S.C. s. 1841(k), of the resulting bank, would control 30 percent or more of the total amount of deposits held by all insured depository institutions in this state. However, this paragraph does not apply to initial entry into this state by an out-of-state bank or bank holding company. (6) NOTICE AND FILING REQUIREMENTS.—An out-of-state bank that will be the resulting bank pursuant to an interstate merger transaction involving a Florida bank must notify the office of the proposed merger within 15 days after the date it files an application for an interstate merger transaction with the appropriate federal regulatory agency and the home state regulatory agency, if applicable. Thereafter, the out-of-state bank and the Florida bank must, upon request of the office, submit status updates with such information as the office specifies until the merger transaction is completed or the merger application is withdrawn or denied. (7) EXAMINATIONS; PERIODIC REPORTS; COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS; ASSESSMENT OF FEES.— (a) The office may examine any Florida branch of an out-of-state state bank which the office deems necessary for the purpose of determining whether the branch is being operated in compliance with the laws of this state and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices. (b) The office may enter into cooperative, coordinating, or information-sharing agreements with other bank regulatory agencies or any organization affiliated with or representing one or more bank regulatory agencies to facilitate the regulation of out-of-state state branches doing business in this state. (c) The office may accept reports of examinations or investigations, or other records from other regulatory agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over a state bank or a bank holding company that controls out-of-state state banks that operate branches in this state in lieu of conducting its own examinations or investigations. (d) The office may assess supervisory and examination fees that are payable by state banks and out-of-state state bank holding companies doing business in this state in connection with the office’s performance of its duties under this section and as prescribed by the commission. Such fees may be shared with other bank regulatory agencies or organizations affiliated with or representing one or more bank regulatory agencies in accordance with agreements between them and the office. (8) LAWS APPLICABLE TO INTERSTATE BRANCHING OPERATIONS.—Laws of this state regarding consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches apply to any out-of-state bank branch doing business in this state to the same extent as the laws of this state apply to a state bank, unless: (a) Federal law preempts the application of the laws of this state. (b) The Comptroller of the Currency determines that the application of the laws of this state would have a discriminatory effect on the branch of a national bank in comparison with the effect the application of such state laws would have with respect to branches of a state bank. (9) ENFORCEMENT.— (a) If the office determines that a branch maintained by an out-of-state state bank in this state is being operated in violation of any law of this state, or that such branch is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner, the office may take all such enforcement actions as it would be empowered to take if the branch were a state bank if the office promptly gives notice to the home state regulator of each enforcement action taken against the out-of-state state bank and, to the extent practicable, consults and cooperates with the home state regulator in pursuing and resolving the enforcement action. (b) The office may take any action jointly with other regulatory agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over out-of-state banks and bank holding companies that operate branches in this state, or take such action independently, to carry out its responsibilities. (10) NOTICE OF SUBSEQUENT MERGER.— (a) Each out-of-state state bank that has established and maintains a branch in this state must give at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the office of any merger, consolidation, or other transaction that would cause a change of control pursuant to home state or federal law with respect to such bank or any bank holding company that controls such bank. (b) In the case of a failing financial institution, the office, with the concurrence of the appropriate regulatory agencies, may issue an emergency order authorizing any necessary interstate banking or branching transaction pursuant to s. 655.4185. (11) DE NOVO INTERSTATE BRANCHING.— (a) As used in this subsection, the term “de novo branch” means a branch of a bank which is originally established by the bank as a branch and does not become a branch of such bank as a result of: 1. The bank’s acquisition of another bank or of a branch of another bank; or 2. The conversion, merger, or consolidation of any bank or branch. (b) With the prior approval of the office, a state bank may establish and maintain a de novo branch or acquire a branch in a state other than this state by submitting an application with the office pursuant to s. 658.26. (c) A state bank desiring to establish and maintain a branch in another state shall pay the branch application fee set forth in s. 658.73. In acting on the application, the office shall consider the views of the appropriate bank regulatory agencies. (d) An out-of-state bank may establish and maintain a de novo branch or acquire a branch in this state upon compliance with chapter 605 or part I of chapter 607 relating to doing business in this state as a foreign business entity, including maintaining a registered agent for service of process and other legal notice pursuant to s. 655.0201. (12) ADDITIONAL BRANCHES; POWERS.— (a) An out-of-state bank that has lawfully acquired or established a branch in this state may establish additional branches in this state to the same extent that any Florida bank may establish branches in this state. (b) An out-of-state bank may conduct only those activities at its Florida branch or branches which are authorized under the laws of this state or of the United States. However, an out-of-state bank with trust powers may exercise all trust powers in this state as a Florida bank with trust powers.

(2) A state bank or trust company may provide for an increase in its number of outstanding shares of capital stock after filing a written notice with the office at least 15 days before making such increase. The office may waive the time requirement upon a demonstration of good cause.

(a) Such plans may include, but are not limited to, mechanisms for stock splits including reverse splits; revaluations of par value of outstanding stock; changes in voting rights, dividends, or other preferences; and creation of new classes of stock.

The office shall also disapprove any plan that is not likely to restore the capital accounts to sufficient levels to achieve a sustainable, safe, and sound financial institution. (d) For any bank or trust company that the office determines to be a failing financial institution pursuant to s. 655.4185, the office may approve special stock offering plans without a vote of the shareholders.

No bank or trust company shall declare any dividend at any time at which its net income from the current year combined with the retained net income from the preceding 2 years is a loss or which would cause the capital accounts of the bank or trust company to fall below the minimum amount required by law, regulation, order, or any written agreement with the office or a state or federal regulatory agency.

Banks so designated shall give satisfactory security for the safekeeping and prompt payment of the public moneys deposited with them and for the faithful performance of their duties as financial agents of the state and its political subdivisions as provided in chapter 280.

However, such excess securities which are not physically withdrawn or removed from deposit or from the pledge thereof shall immediately and automatically, for all purposes and laws, be, and be treated as, redeposited and repledged at such time or times as, and to the extent that, there is an increase in the amount of security required for funds deposited with the bank.

The provisions of this subsection shall be cumulative and shall not be subject to the restrictions or the provisions of any other law relating to the type, characteristics, or form of securities acceptable or required in connection with deposits of any public or other funds or the qualification of depositories therefor, or acceptable or required by any law.

By the domestic lender or credit card bank paying or agreeing to pay the borrower’s obligation. (b) “Credit card account” means an arrangement between a domestic lender or credit card bank and a borrower for the creation of debt pursuant to a credit card and under which: 1. The domestic lender or credit card bank may permit the borrower to create debt from time to time; 2. The unpaid balance of principal of such debt and the loan, finance, or other appropriate charges are debited to an account; 3. A loan finance charge is computed or an interest rate is imposed upon the outstanding balances of the borrower’s account from time to time; and 4. The domestic lender or credit card bank is to render bills or statements to the borrower at regular intervals, the amount of which bills or statement is payable by and due from the borrower on a specified date as stated in such bill or statement or, at the option of the borrower but subject to the terms and conditions of the credit card account, may be paid by the borrower in installments. (c) “Credit card bank” means a national bank that has its principal place of business in this state or a bank organized under the laws of this state, the activities of which are limited by law to those permitted pursuant to subsection (3). (d) “Domestic lender” means any bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other business organization organized or chartered under the laws of this state or of the United States, which in any event is authorized by law to accept deposits and make loans and has its principal place of business in this state. (e) “Foreign lender” means any bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other business organization organized or chartered under the laws of the United States, or any state other than this state or the District of Columbia, which in any event is authorized by law to accept deposits and make loans and has its principal place of business outside this state. (f) The term “business organization” shall have the meaning set forth in s. 658.27(1)(b). (3) Subject to the provisions of this section and to the approval of the office, any domestic lender, foreign lender, or business organization may organize, own, and control a credit card bank on the terms and conditions provided in this section: (a) If the credit card bank is to be organized under the laws of this state, such bank shall be organized as provided in this section; (b) In connection with the application to organize or to control a credit card bank, the applicant shall pay to the office a filing fee as provided in s. 658.73 for the formation of a bank or trust company; (c) The shares of a credit card bank shall be owned solely by a domestic lender, a foreign lender, or a business organization; (d) The credit card bank shall accept deposits only at a single location in this state; (e) The credit card bank shall at all times maintain capital stock and paid-in surplus as required by regulatory policies of the commission and office but in no event less than $4 million; (f) The credit card bank may engage only in the business of soliciting, processing, and making loans pursuant to credit card accounts and conducting such other activities as may be necessarily incident thereto; (g) The credit card bank may not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor has the ability to withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties or others; (h) The credit card bank may accept savings or time deposits of only $100,000 or more; (i) The credit card bank must, prior to opening, obtain and thereafter maintain insurance of its deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and (j) The credit card bank may not engage in the business of making commercial loans. (4) A credit card account between any domestic lender or credit card bank and a borrower, wherever the borrower’s place or residence, shall be governed solely by the laws of this state and federal law unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the parties. However, in no case shall such a writing by the parties supersede the interest rate provisions of s. 655.954. A domestic lender or credit card bank may, as specified in the written agreement governing a credit card account, modify terms or conditions of such credit card account upon prior written notice or such modification as specified by the terms of the agreement governing the credit card account or by the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. ss. 1601 et seq.). Any such notice provided by a domestic lender or credit card bank shall specify that the borrower has the right to surrender the credit card whereupon the borrower shall have the right to continue to pay off the borrower’s credit card account in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions as then in effect. The borrower’s failure to surrender the credit card prior to the modifications becoming effective shall constitute a consent to the modifications. (5) All credit card banks organized under the laws of this state shall be subject to the supervision, regulation, and examination of the office, and the office shall have all enforcement powers with respect thereto as are provided in the financial institutions codes. (6) A credit card bank shall be subject to the provisions of the financial institutions codes except when any rights, powers, privileges, or provisions of the financial institutions codes are inconsistent with the rights, powers, privileges, provisions, or limitations of this section. (7) A credit card bank shall not be considered a “bank” for the purposes of ss. 658.27-658.2953. History.—s. 140, ch. 92-303; s. 1806, ch. 2003-261; s. 102, ch. 2013-18; s. 163, ch. 2014-17.
