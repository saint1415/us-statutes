      "text": "415.103 Central abuse hotline.— (1) The department shall establish and maintain a central abuse hotline that receives all reports made pursuant to s. 415.1034 in writing or through a single statewide toll-free telephone number. Any person may use the statewide toll-free telephone number to report known or suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult at any hour of the day or night, any day of the week. The central abuse hotline must be operated in such a manner as to enable the department to: (a) Accept reports for investigation when there is a reasonable cause to suspect that a vulnerable adult has been or is being abused, neglected, or exploited. (b) Determine whether the allegations made by the reporter require an immediate, 24-hour, or next-working-day response priority. (c) When appropriate, refer calls that do not allege the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult to other organizations that might better resolve the reporter’s concerns. (d) Immediately identify and locate prior reports of abuse, neglect, or exploitation through the central abuse hotline. (e) Track critical steps in the investigative process to ensure compliance with all requirements for all reports. (f) Maintain data to facilitate the production of aggregate statistical reports for monitoring patterns of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. (g) Serve as a resource for the evaluation, management, and planning of preventive and remedial services for vulnerable adults who have been subject to abuse, neglect, or exploitation. (2) Upon receiving an oral or written report of known or suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult, the central abuse hotline must determine if the report requires an immediate onsite protective investigation. For reports requiring an immediate onsite protective investigation, the central abuse hotline must immediately notify the department’s designated protective investigative district staff responsible for protective investigations to ensure prompt initiation of an onsite investigation. For reports not requiring an immediate onsite protective investigation, the central abuse hotline must notify the department’s designated protective investigative district staff responsible for protective investigations in sufficient time to allow for an investigation to be commenced within 24 hours. At the time of notification of district staff with respect to the report, the central abuse hotline must also provide any known information on any previous report concerning a subject of the present report or any pertinent information relative to the present report or any noted earlier reports. If the report is of known or suspected abuse of a vulnerable adult by someone other than a relative, caregiver, or household member, the report shall be immediately transferred to the appropriate county sheriff’s office. (3) The department shall set standards, priorities, and policies to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the central abuse hotline.

      "text": "415.10341 Protection of specified adults.— (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Financial exploitation” means the wrongful or unauthorized taking, withholding, appropriation, or use of money, assets, or property of a specified adult; or any act or omission by a person, including through the use of a power of attorney, guardianship, or conservatorship of a specified adult, to: 1. Obtain control over the specified adult’s money, assets, or property through deception, intimidation, or undue influence to deprive him or her of the ownership, use, benefit, or possession of the money, assets, or property; or 2. Divert the specified adult’s money, assets, or property to deprive him or her of the ownership, use, benefit, or possession of the money, assets, or property. (b) “Financial institution” means a state financial institution or a federal financial institution as those terms are defined under s. 655.005(1). (c) “Specified adult” means a natural person 65 years of age or older, or a vulnerable adult as defined in s. 415.102. (d) “Trusted contact” means a natural person 18 years of age or older whom the account owner has expressly identified and recorded in a financial institution’s books and records as the person who may be contacted about either the account or the account owner to address possible financial exploitation or to confirm the specifics of the account owner’s current contact information or health status; to determine the identity of any conservator, executor, trustee, or individual or entity granted a power of attorney; or to address any other concern reasonably related to the administration of the account. The term may include a joint account owner or an individual or entity who has been granted a power of attorney. (2) The Legislature finds that many persons in this state, because of age or disability, are at increased risk of financial exploitation and loss of their assets, funds, investments, and investment accounts. The Legislature further finds that specified adults in this state are at a statistically higher risk of being targeted for financial exploitation, regardless of diminished capacity or other disability, because of their accumulation of substantial assets and wealth compared to younger age groups. In enacting this section, the Legislature recognizes the freedom of specified adults to manage their assets, make investment choices, and spend their funds, and intends that such rights may not be infringed absent a reasonable belief of financial exploitation as provided in this section. The Legislature therefore intends to provide for the prevention of financial exploitation of such persons. The Legislature intends to encourage the constructive involvement of financial institutions that take action based upon the reasonable belief that specified adults who have accounts with such financial institutions have been or are the subject of financial exploitation, and to provide financial institutions and their employees immunity from liability for taking actions as authorized herein. The Legislature intends to balance the rights of specified adults to direct and control their assets, funds, and investments and to exercise their constitutional rights consistent with due process with the need to provide financial institutions the ability to place narrow, time-limited restrictions on these rights in an effort to decrease specified adults’ risk of loss due to abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation. (3) If a financial institution reports suspected financial exploitation of a specified adult pursuant to s. 415.1034, it may delay a disbursement or transaction from an account of a specified adult or an account for which a specified adult is a beneficiary or beneficial owner if all of the following apply: (a) The financial institution promptly initiates an internal review of the facts and circumstances that caused an employee of the financial institution to report suspected financial exploitation. (b) Not later than 3 business days after the date on which the delay was first placed, the financial institution: 1. Notifies in writing all parties authorized to transact business on the account and any trusted contact on the account, using the contact information provided for the account, with the exception of any party an employee of the financial institution reasonably believes has engaged in, is engaging in, has attempted to engage in, or will attempt to engage in the suspected financial exploitation of the specified adult. The notice, which may be provided electronically, must provide the reason for the delay. 2. Creates and maintains for at least 5 years from the date of the delayed disbursement or transaction a written or electronic record of the delayed disbursement or transaction that includes, at minimum, the following information: a. The date on which the delay was first placed. b. The name and address of the specified adult. c. The business location of the financial institution. d. The name and title of the employee who reported suspected financial exploitation of the specified adult pursuant to s. 415.1034. e. The facts and circumstances that caused the employee to report suspected financial exploitation. (4) A delay on a disbursement or transaction under subsection (3) expires 15 business days after the date on which the delay was first placed. However, the financial institution may extend the delay for up to 30 additional business days if the financial institution’s review of the available facts and circumstances continues to support the reasonable belief that financial exploitation of the specified adult has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted. The length of the delay may be shortened or extended at any time by a court of competent jurisdiction. This subsection does not prevent a financial institution from terminating a delay after communication with the parties authorized to transact business on the account and any trusted contact on the account. (5) A financial institution that acts in good faith and exercises reasonable care to comply with this section is immune from any administrative or civil liability that might otherwise arise from such delay in a disbursement or transaction in accordance with this section. This subsection does not supersede or diminish any immunity granted elsewhere in this chapter. (6) Before placing a delay on a disbursement or transaction pursuant to this section, a financial institution must do all of the following: (a) Develop training policies or programs reasonably designed to educate employees who perform or approve transactions on behalf of customers on issues pertaining to financial exploitation of specified adults. (b) Conduct training for employees described in paragraph (a) as soon as reasonably practicable and maintain a written record of all trainings conducted. With respect to an individual who begins employment with a covered financial institution after July 1, 2024, such training must be conducted within 1 year after the date on which the individual becomes employed by or affiliated or associated with the covered financial institution. (c) Develop, maintain, and enforce written procedures regarding the manner in which suspected financial exploitation is reviewed internally, including, if applicable, the manner in which suspected financial exploitation is required to be reported to supervisory personnel. (7) Absent a reasonable belief of financial exploitation as provided in this section, this section does not otherwise alter a financial institution’s obligations to all parties authorized to transact business on an account and any trusted contact named on such account. (8) This section does not create new rights for or impose new obligations or new duties on a financial institution under other applicable law. History.—s. 1, ch. 2024-200.

      "text": "415.1036 Immunity.— (1) Any person who participates in making a report under s. 415.1034 or participates in a judicial proceeding resulting therefrom is presumed to be acting in good faith and, unless lack of good faith is shown by clear and convincing evidence, is immune from any liability, civil or criminal, that otherwise might be incurred or imposed. This section does not grant immunity, civil or criminal, to any person who is suspected of having abused, neglected, or exploited, or committed any illegal act upon or against, a vulnerable adult. Further, a resident or employee of a facility that serves vulnerable adults may not be subjected to reprisal or discharge because of the resident’s or employee’s actions in reporting abuse, neglect, or exploitation pursuant to s. 415.1034. (2) Any person who makes a report under s. 415.1034 has a civil cause of action for appropriate compensatory and punitive damages against any person who causes detrimental changes in the employment status of the reporting party by reason of the reporting party’s making the report. Any detrimental change made in the residency or employment status of such a person, such as, but not limited to, discharge, termination, demotion, transfer, or reduction in pay or benefits or work privileges, or negative evaluations, within 120 days after the report is made establishes a rebuttable presumption that the detrimental action was retaliatory.

(4) If at any time during a protective investigation the department has reasonable cause to believe that abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult has occurred within a facility that receives Medicaid funds, the department shall notify the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit within the Department of Legal Affairs, Office of the Attorney General, in order that it may begin an investigation concurrent with the protective investigation of the department. This notification may be oral or written.

The court shall determine whether good cause exists for public access to the records sought or a portion thereof. In making this determination, the court shall balance the best interests of the vulnerable adult who is the focus of the investigation together with the privacy right of other persons identified in the reports against the public interest. The public interest in access to such records is reflected in s. 119.01(1), and includes the need for citizens to know of and adequately evaluate the actions of the Department of Children and Families and the court system in providing vulnerable adults of this state with the protections enumerated in s. 415.101. However, this subsection does not contravene s. 415.107, which protects the name of any person reporting the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult. (2) In cases involving serious bodily injury to a vulnerable adult, the Department of Children and Families may petition the court for an order for the immediate public release of records of the department which pertain to the protective investigation. The petition must be personally served upon the vulnerable adult, the vulnerable adult’s legal guardian, if any, and any person named as an alleged perpetrator in the report of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The court must determine whether good cause exists for the public release of the records sought no later than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the date the department filed the petition with the court. If the court does not grant or deny the petition within the 24-hour time period, the department may release to the public summary information including: (a) A confirmation that an investigation has been conducted concerning the alleged victim. (b) The dates and brief description of procedural activities undertaken during the department’s investigation. (c) The date of each judicial proceeding, a summary of each participant’s recommendations made at the judicial proceeding, and the ruling of the court. The summary information shall not include the name of, or other identifying information with respect to, any person identified in any investigation. In making a determination to release confidential information, the court shall balance the best interests of the vulnerable adult who is the focus of the investigation together with the privacy rights of other persons identified in the reports against the public interest for access to public records. However, this subsection does not contravene s. 415.107, which protects the name of any person reporting abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult. (3) When the court determines that good cause for public access exists, the court shall direct that the department redact the name of and other identifying information with respect to any person identified in any protective investigation report until such time as the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person identified committed an act of alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation.

Any information contained in a record created by a review team pursuant to this section which reveals the identity of a victim of abuse, exploitation, or neglect or the identity of persons responsible for the welfare of a victim is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a), Art. I of the State Constitution. 3. Any information that is maintained as exempt or confidential and exempt within this chapter retains its exempt or confidential and exempt status when held by a review team.

If the law enforcement agency believes that there are indicators of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, it must immediately notify the department, which must assure the safety of the vulnerable adult. If the law enforcement agency finds sufficient evidence for prosecution for filing a false report, it must refer the case to the appropriate state attorney for prosecution. (5) A person who knowingly and willfully makes a false report of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a vulnerable adult, or a person who advises another to make a false report, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
