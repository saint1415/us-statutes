      "text": "333.025 Permit required for obstructions.— (1) A person proposing the construction or alteration of an obstruction must obtain a permit from the department, subject to subsections (2), (3), and (4). However, permits from the department will be required only within an airport hazard area where federal obstruction standards are exceeded and if the proposed construction or alteration is within a 10-nautical-mile radius of the airport reference point, located at the approximate geometric center of all usable runways of a public-use airport or military airport. (2) Existing, planned, and proposed facilities on public-use airports contained in an airport master plan, in an airport layout plan submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration, or in comparable military documents shall be protected from airport hazards. (3) A permit is not required for existing structures that received construction permits from the Federal Communications Commission for structures exceeding federal obstruction standards before May 20, 1975; a permit is not required for any necessary replacement or repairs to such existing structures if the height and location are unchanged. (4) If political subdivisions have, in compliance with this chapter, adopted adequate airport protection zoning regulations, placed such regulations on file with the department’s aviation office, and established a permitting process, a permit for the construction or alteration of an obstruction is not required from the department. Upon receipt of a complete permit application, the local government shall provide a copy of the application to the department’s aviation office by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a delivery service that provides a receipt evidencing delivery. To evaluate technical consistency with this subsection, the department shall have a 15-day review period following receipt of the application, which must run concurrently with the local government permitting process. Cranes, construction equipment, and other temporary structures in use or in place for a period not to exceed 18 consecutive months are exempt from the department’s review, unless such review is requested by the department. (5) The department shall, within 30 days after receipt of an application for a permit, issue or deny a permit for the construction or alteration of an obstruction. The department shall review permit applications in conformity with s. 120.60. (6) In determining whether to issue or deny a permit, the department shall consider: (a) The safety of persons on the ground and in the air. (b) The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. (c) The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures. (d) The effect of the construction or alteration of an obstruction on the state licensing standards for a public-use airport contained in chapter 330 and rules adopted thereunder. (e) The character of existing and planned flight operations and developments at public-use airports. (f) Federal airways, visual flight rules, flyways and corridors, and instrument approaches as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration. (g) The effect of the construction or alteration of an obstruction on the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. (h) The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing obstructions and all known proposed obstructions in the area. (7) When issuing a permit under this section, the department shall require the owner of the obstruction to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner’s expense, marking and lighting in conformance with the specific standards established by the Federal Aviation Administration. (8) The department may not approve a permit for the construction or alteration of an obstruction unless the applicant submits documentation showing both compliance with the federal requirement for notification of proposed construction or alteration and a valid aeronautical study. A permit may not be approved solely on the basis that the Federal Aviation Administration determined that the proposed construction or alteration of an obstruction was not an airport hazard. (9) The denial of a permit under this section is subject to administrative review pursuant to chapter 120.

(b) If an airport is owned or controlled by a political subdivision and if any other political subdivision has land upon which an obstruction may be constructed or altered which underlies any surface of the airport as provided in 14 C.F.R. part 77, subpart C, the political subdivisions shall either: 1. By interlocal agreement, adopt, administer, and enforce a set of airport protection zoning regulations; or 2. By ordinance, regulation, or resolution duly adopted, create a joint airport protection zoning board that shall adopt, administer, and enforce a set of airport protection zoning regulations. The joint airport protection zoning board shall have as voting members two representatives appointed by each participating political subdivision and a chair elected by a majority of the members so appointed. The airport manager or a representative of each airport in the affected participating political subdivisions shall serve on the board in a nonvoting capacity. (c) Airport protection zoning regulations adopted under paragraph (a) must, at a minimum, require: 1. A permit for the construction or alteration of any obstruction; 2. Obstruction marking and lighting for obstructions; 3. Documentation showing compliance with the federal requirement for notification of proposed construction or alteration of structures and a valid aeronautical study submitted by each person applying for a permit; 4. Consideration of the criteria in s. 333.025(6), when determining whether to issue or deny a permit; and 5. That approval of a permit not be based solely on the determination by the Federal Aviation Administration that the proposed structure is not an airport hazard. (d) The department shall be available to provide assistance to political subdivisions regarding federal obstruction standards. (2) In the manner provided in subsection (1), political subdivisions shall adopt, administer, and enforce airport land use compatibility zoning regulations. At a minimum, airport land use compatibility zoning regulations must address the following: (a) The prohibition of new landfills and the restriction of existing landfills within the following areas: 1. Within 10,000 feet from the nearest point of any runway used or planned to be used by turbine aircraft. 2. Within 5,000 feet from the nearest point of any runway used by only nonturbine aircraft. 3. Outside the perimeters defined in subparagraphs 1. and 2., but still within the lateral limits of the civil airport imaginary surfaces defined in 14 C.F.R. s. 77.19. Case-by-case review of such landfills is advised. (b) When any landfill is located and constructed in a manner that attracts or sustains hazardous bird movements from feeding, water, or roosting areas into, or across, the runways or approach and departure patterns of aircraft. The landfill operator must incorporate bird management techniques or other practices to minimize bird hazards to airborne aircraft. (c) When an airport authority or other governing body operating a public-use airport has conducted a noise study in accordance with 14 C.F.R. part 150, or when a public-use airport owner has established noise contours pursuant to another public study accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration, the prohibition of incompatible uses, as established in the noise study in 14 C.F.R. part 150, Appendix A or as a part of an alternative Federal Aviation Administration-accepted public study, within the noise contours established by any of these studies, except if such uses are specifically contemplated by such study with appropriate mitigation or similar techniques described in the study. (d) When an airport authority or other governing body operating a public-use airport has not conducted a noise study, the prohibition of residential construction and educational facilities, with the exception of aviation school facilities or residential property near a public-use airport that has as its sole runway a turf runway measuring less than 2,800 feet in length, within an area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half the length of the longest runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. (e) The restriction of new incompatible uses, activities, or substantial modifications to existing incompatible uses within runway protection zones. (3) Political subdivisions shall provide a copy of all airport protection zoning regulations and airport land use compatibility zoning regulations, and any related amendments, to the department’s aviation office within 30 days after adoption. (4) Subsection (2) may not be construed to require the removal, alteration, sound conditioning, or other change, or to interfere with the continued use or adjacent expansion of any educational facility or site in existence on July 1, 1993. (5) Sections 125.01055(7) and 166.04151(7) do not apply to any of the following: (a) A proposed development near a runway within one-quarter of a mile laterally from the runway edge and within an area that is the width of one-quarter of a mile extending at right angles from the end of the runway for a distance of 10,000 feet of any existing airport runway or planned airport runway identified in the local government’s airport master plan. (b) A proposed development within any airport noise zone identified in the federal land use compatibility table or in a land-use zoning or airport noise regulation adopted by the local government. (c) A proposed development that exceeds maximum height restrictions identified in the political subdivision’s airport zoning regulation adopted pursuant to this section. (6) This section does not prohibit an airport authority, a political subdivision or its administrative agency, or any other governing body operating a public-use airport from establishing airport zoning regulations more restrictive than prescribed in this section in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public in the air and on the ground.

Notice of the hearing shall be published at least once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the political subdivision or subdivisions where the airport zoning regulations are to be adopted, amended, or repealed. (2) AIRPORT ZONING COMMISSION.—Before the initial zoning of any airport area under this chapter, the political subdivision or joint airport zoning board that is to adopt, administer, and enforce the regulations must appoint a commission, to be known as the airport zoning commission, to recommend the boundaries of the various zones to be established and the regulations to be adopted therefor. Such commission shall make a preliminary report and hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report, and the legislative body of the political subdivision or the joint airport zoning board may not hold its public hearings or take any action until it has received the final report of such commission, and at least 15 days shall elapse between the receipt of the final report of the commission and the hearing to be held by the latter board. If a planning commission, an airport commission, or a comprehensive zoning commission already exists, it may be appointed as the airport zoning commission.

      "text": "333.06 Airport zoning regulation requirements.— (1) REASONABLENESS.—All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall be reasonable and may not impose any requirement or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. In determining what regulations it may adopt, each political subdivision and joint airport zoning board shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area and runway protection zones, the character of the neighborhood, the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adaptable, and the impact of any new use, activity, or construction on the airport’s operating capability and capacity. (2) INDEPENDENT JUSTIFICATION.—The purpose of all airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter is to provide both airspace protection and land uses compatible with airport operations. Each aspect of this purpose requires independent justification in order to promote the public interest in safety, health, and general welfare. Specifically, construction in a runway protection zone which does not exceed airspace height restrictions is not conclusive that such use, activity, or construction is compatible with airport operations. (3) NONCONFORMING USES.—An airport protection zoning regulation adopted under this chapter may not require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any obstruction not conforming to the regulation when adopted or amended, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as provided in s. 333.07(1) and (3). (4) ADOPTION OF AIRPORT MASTER PLAN AND NOTICE TO AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.—An airport master plan shall be prepared by each public-use airport licensed by the department under chapter 330. The authorized entity having responsibility for governing the operation of the airport, when either requesting from or submitting to a state or federal governmental agency with funding or approval jurisdiction a “finding of no significant impact,” an environmental assessment, a site-selection study, an airport master plan, or any amendment to an airport master plan, shall submit simultaneously a copy of said request, submittal, assessment, study, plan, or amendments by certified mail to all affected local governments. As used in this subsection, the term “affected local government” is defined as any municipality or county having jurisdiction over the airport and any municipality or county located within 2 miles of the boundaries of the land subject to the airport master plan.

A permit may not be issued if it would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or if it would permit a nonconforming obstruction to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable airport protection zoning regulation was adopted which allowed the establishment or creation of the obstruction, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. (b) If the political subdivision or its administrative agency determines that a nonconforming obstruction has been abandoned or is more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed, a permit may not be granted if it would allow the obstruction to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the airport protection zoning regulations. Whether or not an application is made for a permit under this subsection, the owner of the nonconforming obstruction may be required, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, alter, or equip such obstruction as may be necessary to conform to the current airport protection zoning regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming obstruction neglects or refuses to comply with such requirement for 10 days after notice, the administrative agency may report the violation to the political subdivision involved, which subdivision, through its appropriate agency, may proceed to have the obstruction so lowered, removed, reconstructed, altered, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner of the obstruction or the land whereon it is or was located. (2) CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ISSUING OR DENYING PERMITS.—In determining whether to issue or deny a permit, the political subdivision or its administrative agency must consider the following, as applicable: (a) The safety of persons on the ground and in the air. (b) The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. (c) The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures. (d) The effect of the construction or alteration on the state licensing standards for a public-use airport contained in chapter 330 and rules adopted thereunder. (e) The character of existing and planned flight operations and developments at public-use airports. (f) Federal airways, visual flight rules, flyways and corridors, and instrument approaches as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration. (g) The effect of the construction or alteration of the proposed structure on the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. (h) The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures and all other known proposed structures in the area. (i) Additional requirements adopted by the political subdivision or administrative agency pertinent to evaluation and protection of airspace and airport operations. (3) OBSTRUCTION MARKING AND LIGHTING.—In issuing a permit under this section, the political subdivision or its administrative agency shall require the owner of the obstruction to install, operate, and maintain thereon, at his or her own expense, marking and lighting in conformance with the specific standards established by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The findings of fact by the political subdivision or its administrative agency, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be accepted by the court as conclusive, and an objection to a decision of the political subdivision or its administrative agency may not be considered by the court unless such objection was raised in the underlying proceeding. (3) If airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter are held by a court to interfere with the use and enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land to such an extent, or to be so onerous in their application to such a structure or parcel of land, as to constitute a taking or deprivation of that property in violation of the State Constitution or the Constitution of the United States, such holding shall not affect the application of such regulations to other structures and parcels of land, or such regulations as are not involved in the particular decision. (4) A judicial appeal to any court may not be permitted under this section until the appellant has exhausted all of its remedies through application for local government permits, exceptions, and appeals.
