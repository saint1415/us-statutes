      "text": "463.0055 Administration and prescription of ocular pharmaceutical agents.— (1)(a) Certified optometrists may administer and prescribe ocular pharmaceutical agents as provided in this section for the diagnosis and treatment of ocular conditions of the human eye and its appendages without the use of surgery or other invasive techniques. However, a licensed practitioner who is not certified may use topically applied anesthetics solely for the purpose of glaucoma examinations, but is otherwise prohibited from administering or prescribing ocular pharmaceutical agents. (b) Before a certified optometrist may administer or prescribe oral ocular pharmaceutical agents, the certified optometrist must provide proof to the department of successful completion of a course and subsequent examination, approved by the board, on general and ocular pharmaceutical agents and the side effects of those agents. The course shall consist of 20 contact hours, all of which may be web-based. The first course and examination shall be presented by October 1, 2013, and shall be administered at least annually thereafter. The course and examination shall be developed and offered jointly by a statewide professional association of physicians in this state accredited to provide educational activities designated for the American Medical Association Physician’s Recognition Award (AMA PRA) Category 1 credit and a statewide professional association of licensed practitioners which provides board-approved continuing education on an annual basis. The board shall review and approve the content of the initial course and examination if the board determines that the course and examination adequately and reliably satisfy the criteria set forth in this section. The board shall thereafter annually review and approve the course and examination if the board determines that the content continues to adequately and reliably satisfy the criteria set forth in this section. Successful completion of the board-approved course and examination may be used by a certified optometrist to satisfy 20 hours of the continuing education requirements in s. 463.007(3), only for the biennial period in which the board-approved course and examination are taken. If a certified optometrist does not complete a board-approved course and examination under this section, the certified optometrist is only authorized to administer and prescribe topical ocular pharmaceutical agents. (2)(a) The board shall establish a formulary of topical ocular pharmaceutical agents that may be prescribed and administered by a certified optometrist. The formulary shall consist of those topical ocular pharmaceutical agents that are appropriate to treat or diagnose ocular diseases and disorders and that the certified optometrist is qualified to use in the practice of optometry. The board shall establish, add to, delete from, or modify the topical formulary by rule. Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 120 to the contrary, the topical formulary rule becomes effective 60 days from the date it is filed with the Secretary of State. (b) The formulary may be added to, deleted from, or modified according to the procedure described in paragraph (a). Any person who requests an addition, deletion, or modification of an authorized topical ocular pharmaceutical agent shall have the burden of proof to show cause why such addition, deletion, or modification should be made. (c) The State Surgeon General shall have standing to challenge any rule or proposed rule of the board pursuant to s. 120.56. In addition to challenges for any invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority, the administrative law judge, upon such a challenge by the State Surgeon General, may declare all or part of a rule or proposed rule invalid if it: 1. Does not protect the public from any significant and discernible harm or damages; 2. Unreasonably restricts competition or the availability of professional services in the state or in a significant part of the state; or 3. Unnecessarily increases the cost of professional services without a corresponding or equivalent public benefit. However, there shall not be created a presumption of the existence of any of the conditions cited in this subsection in the event that the rule or proposed rule is challenged. (d) Upon adoption of the formulary required by this section, and upon each addition, deletion, or modification to the formulary, the board shall mail a copy of the amended formulary to each certified optometrist and to each pharmacy licensed by the state. (3) In addition to the formulary of topical ocular pharmaceutical agents established by rule of the board, there is created a statutory formulary of oral ocular pharmaceutical agents, which includes the following agents: (a) The following analgesics or their generic or therapeutic equivalents, which may not be administered or prescribed for more than 72 hours without consultation with a physician licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 who is skilled in diseases of the eye: 1. Tramadol hydrochloride. 2. Acetaminophen 300 mg with No. 3 codeine phosphate 30 mg. (b) The following antibiotics or their generic or therapeutic equivalents: 1. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. 2. Azithromycin. 3. Erythromycin. 4. Dicloxacillin. 5. Doxycycline/Tetracycline. 6. Keflex. 7. Minocycline. (c) The following antivirals or their generic or therapeutic equivalents: 1. Acyclovir. 2. Famciclovir. 3. Valacyclovir. (d) The following oral anti-glaucoma agents or their generic or therapeutic equivalents, which may not be administered or prescribed for more than 72 hours: 1. Acetazolamide. 2. Methazolamide. Any oral ocular pharmaceutical agent that is listed in the statutory formulary set forth in this subsection and that is subsequently determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration to be unsafe for administration or prescription shall be considered to have been deleted from the formulary of oral ocular pharmaceutical agents. The oral ocular pharmaceutical agents on the statutory formulary set forth in this subsection may not otherwise be deleted by the board, the department, or the State Surgeon General. (4) A certified optometrist shall be issued a prescriber number by the board. Any prescription written by a certified optometrist for an ocular pharmaceutical agent pursuant to this section shall have the prescriber number printed thereon. A certified optometrist may not administer or prescribe: (a) A controlled substance listed in Schedule III, Schedule IV, or Schedule V of s. 893.03, except for an oral analgesic placed on the formulary pursuant to this section for the relief of pain due to ocular conditions of the eye and its appendages. (b) A controlled substance for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain as defined in s. 456.44(1)(f).

Such certificates shall automatically expire upon termination of the holder’s relationship with the school or after a period of 2 years, whichever occurs first. (3) The holder of a faculty certificate may engage in the practice of optometry as permitted by this section but may not administer or prescribe topical ocular pharmaceutical agents unless the certificateholder has satisfied the requirements of s. 463.006(1)(e) and (f). If a certificateholder wishes to administer or prescribe oral ocular pharmaceutical agents, the certificateholder must also satisfy the requirements of s. 463.0055(1)(b).

(4) A licensed practitioner shall promptly advise a patient to seek evaluation by a physician skilled in diseases of the eye and licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459 for diagnosis and possible treatment whenever the licensed practitioner is informed by the patient of the sudden onset of spots or “floaters” with loss of all or part of the visual field. (5) The licensed practitioner shall routinely advise a patient to immediately contact the licensed practitioner if the patient experiences an adverse drug reaction. (6) The licensed practitioner shall, when appropriate, refer to medical specialists or facilities patients who notify a licensed practitioner of an adverse drug reaction. (7) The licensed practitioner shall place in a patient’s permanent record information describing any adverse drug reaction experienced by the patient, the date of such reaction, and whether any referral was made. (8) The licensed practitioner shall maintain the names of at least three physicians, physician clinics, or hospitals to whom the licensed practitioner will refer patients who experience an adverse drug reaction. At least one of these physicians shall be a physician skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the eye and licensed under chapter 458 or chapter 459.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the association of a licensed practitioner with a multidisciplinary group of licensed health care professionals, the primary objective of which is the diagnosis and treatment of the human body. (b) No licensed practitioner shall engage in the practice of optometry with any corporation, organization, group, or lay individual. This provision shall not prohibit licensed practitioners from employing, or from forming partnerships or professional associations with, licensed practitioners licensed in this state or with other licensed health care professionals, the primary objective of whom is the diagnosis and treatment of the human body. (c) No rule of the board shall forbid the practice of optometry in or on the premises of a commercial or mercantile establishment. (d) No licensed practitioner may practice under practice identification names, trade names, or service names, unless any dissemination of information by the practitioner to consumers contains the name under which the practitioner is licensed or that of the professional association in which the practitioner participates. Any advertisement or other dissemination of information to consumers may contain factual information as to the geographic location of licensed practitioners or of the availability of optometric services. (e) No licensed practitioner shall adopt and publish or cause to be published any practice identification name, trade name, or service name which is, contains, or is intended to serve as an affirmation of the quality or competitive value of the optometric services provided at the identified practice. (2) A corporation or labor organization may employ licensed practitioners to provide optometric services to bona fide employees of such corporation and members of their immediate families or to bona fide members of such labor organization and members of their immediate families, provided the provision of such services is incidental to the legitimate business of such corporation or labor organization. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the employment of licensed practitioners by corporations or organizations formed primarily for such purposes. (3) Prescribing, ordering, dispensing, administering, supplying, selling, or giving any drug for the purpose of treating a systemic disease by a licensed practitioner is prohibited. However, a certified optometrist is permitted to use commonly accepted means or methods to immediately address incidents of anaphylaxis. (4) Surgery of any kind is expressly prohibited. Certified optometrists may remove superficial foreign bodies. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “superficial foreign bodies” means any foreign matter that is embedded in the conjunctiva or cornea but that has not penetrated the globe. Notwithstanding the definition of surgery as provided in s. 463.002(6), a certified optometrist is not prohibited from providing any optometric care within the practice of optometry as defined in s. 463.002(7), such as removing an eyelash by epilation, probing an uninflamed tear duct in a patient 18 years of age or older, blocking the puncta by plug, or superficial scraping for the purpose of removing damaged epithelial tissue or superficial foreign bodies or taking a culture of the surface of the cornea or conjunctiva. (5) No rule of the board shall prohibit a licensed practitioner from authorizing a board-certified optician to fill, fit, adapt, or dispense a contact lens prescription as authorized under chapter 484.
