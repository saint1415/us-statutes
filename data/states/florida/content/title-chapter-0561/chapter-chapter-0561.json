Moneys distributed pursuant to this paragraph may not be used to secure bonds or other forms of indebtedness nor be pledged for debt service. This paragraph is repealed June 30, 2054. (c) The remainder of the funds collected pursuant to ss. 563.05, 564.06, and 565.12 and the tax on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products established in s. 565.02(9) shall be credited to the General Revenue Fund. (2) The unencumbered balance in the Alcoholic Beverage and Tobacco Trust Fund at the close of each fiscal year may not exceed $2 million. These funds shall be held in reserve for use in the event that trust fund revenues are unable to meet the division’s appropriation for the next fiscal year. In the event of a revenue shortfall, these funds shall be spent pursuant to subsection (3). Notwithstanding subsection (1), if the unencumbered balance on June 30 in any fiscal year is less than $2 million, the department is authorized to retain the difference between the June 30 unencumbered balance in the trust fund and $2 million from the July collections of state funds collected pursuant to ss. 563.05, 564.06, and 565.12 and the tax on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products established in s. 565.02(9). Any unencumbered funds in excess of reserve funds shall be transferred unallocated to the General Revenue Fund by August 31 of the next fiscal year. (3) Funds deposited into the Alcoholic Beverage and Tobacco Trust Fund pursuant to subsection (1) shall be used for administration and enforcement of chapters 210, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 567, 568, and 569.

Persons engaged in the business of distilling, rectifying, or blending spirituous liquors licensed under s. 565.03(2) shall sell and distribute such beverages at wholesale only to other manufacturers and to licensed distributors and to no one else within this state. (2) Distributors licensed to sell and distribute alcoholic beverages at wholesale to persons who are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. (3) Vendors licensed to sell alcoholic beverages at retail only. No vendor shall purchase or acquire in any manner for the purpose of resale any alcoholic beverages from any person not licensed as a vendor, manufacturer, bottler, or distributor under the Beverage Law. Purchases of alcoholic beverages by vendors from vendors shall be strictly limited to purchases between members of a pool buying group for which the initial purchase of the alcoholic beverages was ordered by a pool buying agent as a single transaction. No vendor shall be a member of more than one cooperative or pool buying group at any time. No vendor shall import, or engage in the importation of, any alcoholic beverages from places beyond the limits of the state. (4) Brokers or sales agents, whether resident or nonresident, licensed to sell, or to cause to be sold, shipped, and invoiced, alcoholic beverages to licensed manufacturers or licensed distributors, and to no one else, in this state. Such licensed brokers or sales agents, except as relates to malt beverages, only shall represent one or more primary American sources of supply, registered as such with the division, and may be compensated on a commission or remuneration basis and shall have no direct or indirect affiliation with any vendor licensed in this state. This license classification does not include manufacturers’ representatives who are registered with the division under the provisions of ss. 564.045(1) and (2) and 565.095(1) and (2). (5) Importers, whether resident or nonresident, licensed to sell, or to cause to be sold, shipped, and invoiced, alcoholic beverages to licensed manufacturers or licensed distributors, and to no one else, in this state; provided that the provisions of ss. 564.045 and 565.095 are in no way violated by such imports. Such licensed importers shall have no direct or indirect affiliation with any vendor licensed in this state. The holder of an importer’s license shall be considered as having complied with the licensing requirements of a broker or sales agent. This license classification does not include manufacturers’ representatives who are registered with the division under the provisions of ss. 564.045(1) and (2) and 565.095(1) and (2). (6) Bottle clubs. It is the finding of the Legislature that bottle clubs are susceptible to a distinct and separate classification under the Beverage Law for purposes of regulating establishments permitting the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any person operating a bottle club must be licensed pursuant to this chapter and may not hold any other alcoholic beverage license for such premises while licensed as a bottle club. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the purchase at wholesale or retail of alcoholic beverages for supplying or reselling to the patrons pursuant to a license issued under this chapter. Any such business shall be subject to all general, special, and local laws regulating vendors of alcoholic beverages. Bottle club licenses shall be issued at a fee of $500 annually and shall be renewed in accordance with the schedule set out in ss. 561.26 and 561.27. This subsection shall include bottle clubs in existence on January 1, 1991. The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco is hereby authorized to adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section. (7) Exporters registered to sell alcoholic beverages.

The applicant must be a legal or business entity, person, or persons and must include all persons, officers, shareholders, and directors of such legal or business entity that have a direct or indirect interest in the business seeking to be licensed under this part. However, the applicant does not include any person that derives revenue from the license solely through a contractual relationship with the licensee, the substance of which contractual relationship is not related to the control of the sale of alcoholic beverages. Before any application is approved, the division may require the applicant to file a set of fingerprints electronically through an approved electronic fingerprinting vendor or on forms prescribed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for herself or himself and for any person or persons interested directly or indirectly with the applicant in the business for which the license is being sought, when required by the division. If the applicant or any person who is interested with the applicant either directly or indirectly in the business or who has a security interest in the license being sought or has a right to a percentage payment from the proceeds of the business, either by lease or otherwise, is not qualified, the division shall deny the application. However, any company regularly traded on a national securities exchange and not over the counter; any insurer, as defined in the Florida Insurance Code; or any bank or savings and loan association chartered by this state, another state, or the United States which has an interest, directly or indirectly, in an alcoholic beverage license is not required to obtain the division’s approval of its officers, directors, or stockholders or any change of such positions or interests. A shopping center with five or more stores, one or more of which has an alcoholic beverage license and is required under a lease common to all shopping center tenants to pay no more than 10 percent of the gross proceeds of the business holding the license to the shopping center, is not considered as having an interest, directly or indirectly, in the license. A performing arts center, as defined in s. 561.01, which has an interest, directly or indirectly, in an alcoholic beverage license is not required to obtain division approval of its volunteer officers or directors or of any change in such positions or interests. (2) All applications for any alcoholic beverage license must be accompanied by proof of the applicant’s right of occupancy for the entire premises sought to be licensed. All applications for alcoholic beverage licenses for consumption on the premises shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Division of Hotels and Restaurants of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Department of Health, the Agency for Health Care Administration, or the county health department that the place of business wherein the business is to be conducted meets all of the sanitary requirements of the state. (3) A transfer of 10 percent of any financial interest, a change of executive officers or directors, or a divestiture or resignation of such interest or position, in a business holding a vendor’s license permitting the sale of any alcoholic beverages regardless of alcoholic content shall be contingent upon the express approval by the division of the persons holding or acquiring such interest or position except for persons exempted in subsection (1). (4) Any person, before engaging in the business of exporting alcoholic beverages, must file with the district supervisor of the district of the division in which the exporter’s business is located, a registration on forms provided to the district supervisor by the division. An exporter may not register unless she or he has complied with all appropriate federal regulations, including federal permitting regulations. (5) Any person or entity licensed or permitted by the division, or applying for a license or permit, must create and maintain an account with the division’s online system and provide an e-mail address to the division to function as the primary means of contact for all communication by the division to the licensee, permittee, or applicant. Licensees, permittees, and applicants are responsible for maintaining accurate contact information on file with the division. A person or an entity seeking a license or permit from the division must apply using forms prepared by the division and filed through the division’s online system before engaging in any business for which a license or permit is required. The division may not process an application for an alcoholic beverage license unless the application is submitted through the division’s online system.

After all applications are filed with the director, the director shall then determine by random selection drawing the order in which each applicant’s name shall be matched with a number selected by random drawing, and that number shall determine the order in which the applicant will be considered for a license. This paragraph does not prohibit a person holding a perfected lien or security interest in a quota alcoholic beverage license, in accordance with s. 561.65, from enforcing the lien or security interest against the license within 180 days after a final order of revocation or suspension. A revoked quota alcoholic beverage license encumbered by a lien or security interest, perfected pursuant to s. 561.65, may not be issued under this subsection until the 180-day period has elapsed or until such enforcement proceeding is final. (b) Any portion of the drawing results of a particular county which reveals the rank order of persons not receiving notice of selection is confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1), until such time as all of the licenses from that county’s drawing have been issued. (c) Subject to this selection process, an applicant shall, after a drawing is held, have 45 days from the date the division mails the notice of selection to file an application on forms provided by the division and if such applicant is found by the division to be qualified, a license shall be issued. The application shall be filed pursuant to s. 561.17, and the license shall be issued upon the payment of the applicable license fees. If the applicant is not prepared to use the license at a business location, the license shall be held in an inactive status by the division, and the licensee shall be required to activate the license at a location in accordance with s. 561.29. Nothing contained herein, however, shall prohibit the division from revoking a license issued to a person, firm, or corporation that would not qualify for the issuance of a new license or the transfer of an existing license. (d) The director shall not include more than one application from any one person, firm, or corporation in the random selection process, nor may she or he consider more than one application for any one person, firm, or corporation when there are fewer applications than available licenses. (e) Each applicant for inclusion in the drawing shall pay to the division a filing fee of $100. (3) In the event that the number of applications does not exceed the number of licenses available, the drawing provided in subsection (2) shall not be held, but the licenses shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2). (4) The issuance of licenses pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (3) shall not be governed by the provisions of s. 120.60. The issuance of any such license shall occur no later than 180 days after a drawing is held pursuant to notice published in the Florida Administrative Register or, in the event no drawing is held, within 180 days of the final date for filing applications. Any applicant who is not included in the pool for drawing to determine priority shall file, within 30 days of the date of mailing of notice to such applicant, a challenge to such action pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57, or the right to file any action as to such matter shall be forever lost. Any applicant whose name is included in the pool for drawing to determine priority but who is not issued a license shall be entitled to request a hearing on the denial pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57 only on the grounds that the selection process was not conducted in accordance with law or that the licensee selected does not possess the qualifications required by law. (5) A fee of $10,750 shall be collected from each person, firm, or corporation that is issued a new liquor license subject to the limitation imposed in s. 561.20(1) as provided in this section. This initial license fee shall not be imposed on any license renewal and shall be in addition to the license fees imposed by s. 565.02. The revenues collected from the initial license fee imposed by this subsection shall be deposited in the Department of Children and Families’ Operations and Maintenance Trust Fund to be used only for alcohol and drug abuse education, treatment, and prevention programs. (6) The state license tax shall be collected by the division, and the division shall return the county and municipal share pursuant to s. 561.342 to the appropriate county and municipality monthly on or before the 10th day of the month succeeding the beginning of the taxable year and quarterly thereafter.

      "heading": "Limitation upon number of licenses issued.",
      "text": "561.20 Limitation upon number of licenses issued.— (1) No license under s. 565.02(1)(a)-(f), inclusive, shall be issued so that the number of such licenses within the limits of the territory of any county exceeds one such license to each 7,500 residents within such county. Regardless of the number of quota licenses issued prior to October 1, 2000, on and after that date, a new license under s. 565.02(1)(a)-(f), inclusive, shall be issued for each population increase of 7,500 residents above the number of residents who resided in the county according to the April 1, 1999, Florida Estimate of Population as published by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida, and thereafter, based on the last regular population estimate prepared pursuant to s. 186.901, for such county. Such population estimates shall be the basis for annual license issuance regardless of any local acts to the contrary. However, such limitation shall not prohibit the issuance of at least three licenses in any county that may approve the sale of intoxicating liquors in such county. (2)(a) The limitation of the number of licenses as provided in this section does not prohibit the issuance of a special license to: 1. Any bona fide hotel, motel, or motor court of not fewer than 80 guest rooms in any county having a population of less than 50,000 residents, and of not fewer than 100 guest rooms in any county having a population of 50,000 residents or greater; or any bona fide hotel or motel located in a historic structure, as defined in s. 561.01(20), with fewer than 100 guest rooms which derives at least 51 percent of its gross revenue from the rental of hotel or motel rooms, which is licensed as a public lodging establishment by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants; provided, however, that a bona fide hotel or motel with no fewer than 10 and no more than 25 guest rooms which is a historic structure, as defined in s. 561.01(20), in a municipality that on the effective date of this act has a population, according to the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research Estimates of Population for 1998, of no fewer than 25,000 and no more than 35,000 residents and that is within a constitutionally chartered county may be issued a special license. This special license shall allow the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages only on the licensed premises of the hotel or motel. In addition, the hotel or motel must derive at least 60 percent of its gross revenue from the rental of hotel or motel rooms and the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages; provided that this subparagraph shall supersede local laws requiring a greater number of hotel rooms; 2. Any condominium accommodation of which no fewer than 100 condominium units are wholly rentable to transients and which is licensed under chapter 509, except that the license shall be issued only to the person or corporation that operates the hotel or motel operation and not to the association of condominium owners; 3. Any condominium accommodation of which no fewer than 50 condominium units are wholly rentable to transients, which is licensed under chapter 509, and which is located in any county having home rule under s. 10 or s. 11, Art. VIII of the State Constitution of 1885, as amended, and incorporated by reference in s. 6(e), Art. VIII of the State Constitution, except that the license shall be issued only to the person or corporation that operates the hotel or motel operation and not to the association of condominium owners; 4. A bona fide food service establishment that has a minimum of 2,000 square feet of service area, is equipped to serve meals to 120 persons at one time, has at least 120 physical seats available for patrons to use during operating hours, holds itself out as a restaurant, and derives at least 51 percent of its gross food and beverage revenue from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages during the first 120-day operating period and the first 12-month operating period thereafter. Subsequent audit timeframes must be based upon the audit percentage established by the most recent audit and conducted on a staggered scale as follows: level 1, 51 percent to 60 percent, every year; level 2, 61 percent to 75 percent, every 2 years; level 3, 76 percent to 90 percent, every 3 years; and level 4, 91 percent to 100 percent, every 4 years. A licensee under this subparagraph may sell or deliver alcoholic beverages in a sealed container for off-premises consumption if the sale or delivery is accompanied by the sale of food within the same order. Such authorized sale or delivery includes wine-based and liquor-based beverages prepared by the licensee or its employee and packaged in a container sealed by the licensee or its employee. This subparagraph may not be construed to authorize public food service establishments licensed under this subparagraph to sell a bottle of distilled spirits sealed by a manufacturer. Any sale or delivery of malt beverages must comply with the container size, labeling, and filling requirements imposed under s. 563.06. Any delivery of an alcoholic beverage under this subparagraph must comply with s. 561.57. An alcoholic beverage drink prepared by the vendor and sold or delivered for consumption off the premises must be placed in a container securely sealed by the licensee or its employees with an unbroken seal that prevents the beverage from being immediately consumed before removal from the premises. Such alcoholic beverage also must be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a dated receipt for the alcoholic beverage and food must be provided by the licensee and attached to the bag or container. If transported in a motor vehicle, an alcoholic beverage that is not in a container sealed by the manufacturer must be placed in a locked compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the last upright seat of a motor vehicle. It is a violation of the prohibition in s. 562.11 to allow any person under the age of 21 to deliver alcoholic beverages on behalf of a vendor. The vendor or the agent or employee of the vendor must verify the age of the person making the delivery of the alcoholic beverage before allowing any person to take possession of an alcoholic beverage for the purpose of making a delivery on behalf of a vendor under this section. A food service establishment granted a special license on or after January 1, 1958, pursuant to general or special law may not operate as a package store and may not sell intoxicating beverages under such license after the hours of serving or consumption of food have elapsed. Failure by a licensee to meet the required percentage of food and nonalcoholic beverage gross revenues during the covered operating period shall result in revocation of the license or denial of the pending license application. A licensee whose license is revoked or an applicant whose pending application is denied, or any person required to qualify on the special license application, is ineligible to have any interest in a subsequent application for such a license for a period of 120 days after the date of the final denial or revocation; 5. Any caterer, deriving at least 51 percent of its gross food and beverage revenue from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages at each catered event, licensed by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants under chapter 509. This subparagraph does not apply to a culinary education program, as defined in s. 381.0072(2), which is licensed as a public food service establishment by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants and provides catering services. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a licensee under this subparagraph shall sell or serve alcoholic beverages only for consumption on the premises of a catered event at which the licensee is also providing prepared food, and shall prominently display its license at any catered event at which the caterer is selling or serving alcoholic beverages. A licensee under this subparagraph shall purchase all alcoholic beverages it sells or serves at a catered event from a vendor licensed under s. 563.02(1), s. 564.02(1), or licensed under s. 565.02(1) subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (1), as appropriate. A licensee under this subparagraph may not store any alcoholic beverages to be sold or served at a catered event. Any alcoholic beverages purchased by a licensee under this subparagraph for a catered event that are not used at that event must remain with the customer; provided that if the vendor accepts unopened alcoholic beverages, the licensee may return such alcoholic beverages to the vendor for a credit or reimbursement. Regardless of the county or counties in which the licensee operates, a licensee under this subparagraph shall pay the annual state license tax set forth in s. 565.02(1)(b). A licensee under this subparagraph must maintain for a period of 3 years all records and receipts for each catered event, including all contracts, customers’ names, event locations, event dates, food purchases and sales, alcoholic beverage purchases and sales, nonalcoholic beverage purchases and sales, and any other records required by the department by rule to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any vendor licensed under s. 565.02(1) subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (1), may, without any additional licensure under this subparagraph, serve or sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises of a catered event at which prepared food is provided by a caterer licensed under chapter 509. If a licensee under this subparagraph also possesses any other license under the Beverage Law, the license issued under this subparagraph may not authorize the holder to conduct activities on the premises to which the other license or licenses apply that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of that license or the Beverage Law. This section does not permit the licensee to conduct activities that are otherwise prohibited by the Beverage Law or local law. The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco is hereby authorized to adopt rules to administer the license created in this subparagraph, to include rules governing licensure, recordkeeping, and enforcement. The first $300,000 in fees collected by the division each fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Department of Children and Families’ Operations and Maintenance Trust Fund to be used only for alcohol and drug abuse education, treatment, and prevention programs. The remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited into the Hotel and Restaurant Trust Fund created pursuant to s. 509.072; or 6. A culinary education program as defined in s. 381.0072(2) which is licensed as a public food service establishment by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants. a. This special license shall allow the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises of the culinary education program. The culinary education program shall specify designated areas in the facility where the alcoholic beverages may be consumed at the time of application. Alcoholic beverages sold for consumption on the premises may be consumed only in areas designated under s. 561.01(11) and may not be removed from the designated area. Such license shall be applicable only in and for designated areas used by the culinary education program. b. If the culinary education program provides catering services, this special license shall also allow the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a catered event at which the licensee is also providing prepared food. A culinary education program that provides catering services is not required to derive at least 51 percent of its gross revenue from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a licensee that provides catering services under this sub-subparagraph shall prominently display its beverage license at any catered event at which the caterer is selling or serving alcoholic beverages. Regardless of the county or counties in which the licensee operates, a licensee under this sub-subparagraph shall pay the annual state license tax set forth in s. 565.02(1)(b). A licensee under this sub-subparagraph must maintain for a period of 3 years all records required by the department by rule to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this sub-subparagraph. c. If a licensee under this subparagraph also possesses any other license under the Beverage Law, the license issued under this subparagraph does not authorize the holder to conduct activities on the premises to which the other license or licenses apply that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of that license or the Beverage Law. This subparagraph does not permit the licensee to conduct activities that are otherwise prohibited by the Beverage Law or local law. Any culinary education program that holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages shall comply with the age requirements set forth in ss. 562.11(4), 562.111(2), and 562.13. d. The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco may adopt rules to administer the license created in this subparagraph, to include rules governing licensure, recordkeeping, and enforcement. e. A license issued pursuant to this subparagraph does not permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages by the package for off-premises consumption. However, any license heretofore issued to any such hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant or hereafter issued to any such hotel, motel, or motor court, including a condominium accommodation, under the general law may not be moved to a new location, such license being valid only on the premises of such hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant. Licenses issued to hotels, motels, motor courts, or restaurants under the general law and held by such hotels, motels, motor courts, or restaurants on May 24, 1947, shall be counted in the quota limitation contained in subsection (1). Any license issued for any hotel, motel, or motor court under this law shall be issued only to the owner of the hotel, motel, or motor court or, in the event the hotel, motel, or motor court is leased, to the lessee of the hotel, motel, or motor court; and the license shall remain in the name of the owner or lessee so long as the license is in existence. Any special license now in existence heretofore issued under this law cannot be renewed except in the name of the owner of the hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant or, in the event the hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant is leased, in the name of the lessee of the hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant in which the license is located and must remain in the name of the owner or lessee so long as the license is in existence. Any license issued under this section shall be marked “Special,” and nothing herein provided shall limit, restrict, or prevent the issuance of a special license for any restaurant or motel which shall hereafter meet the requirements of the law existing immediately before the effective date of this act, if construction of such restaurant has commenced before the effective date of this act and is completed within 30 days thereafter, or if an application is on file for such special license at the time this act takes effect; and any such licenses issued under this proviso may be annually renewed as now provided by law. Nothing herein prevents an application for transfer of a license to a bona fide purchaser of any hotel, motel, motor court, or restaurant by the purchaser of such facility or the transfer of such license pursuant to law. (b) Any county in which special licenses were issued under the provisions of s. 561.20(2)(b) in effect prior to the effective date of this act shall continue to qualify for such licenses pursuant to those provisions in effect prior to the effective date of this act, and shall not be affected by the provisions of paragraph (a), except that in such counties, any restaurant located in a specialty center built on governmentally owned land shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (a). 1. A specialty center means any development having at least 50,000 square feet of leasable area, containing restaurants, entertainment facilities, and specialty shops, and located adjacent to a navigable water body. Alcoholic beverages sold for consumption on the premises by a vendor in a specialty center may be consumed within the specialty center but may not be removed from such premises. 2. A specialty center also means any enclosed development that has at least 170,000 square feet of leasable area that is under the dominion and physical control of the owner or manager of the enclosed development, containing restaurants, entertainment facilities, specialty shops, and a movie theater with at least 18 operating screens. Alcoholic beverages sold for consumption on the premises by a vendor in a specialty center may be consumed only in areas designated pursuant to s. 561.01(11) and may not be removed from the designated area. (c) In addition to any special licenses that may be issued under the provisions of paragraph (a), the division is authorized to issue special licenses to qualified applicants who own or lease bowling establishments having 12 or more lanes and all necessary equipment to operate them. Any license issued for any bowling establishment under the provisions of this paragraph shall be issued only to the owner of the bowling establishment or, in the event the bowling establishment is leased, to the lessee of the bowling establishment; and the license shall remain in the name of the owner or lessee so long as the license is in existence. Any such license issued under this paragraph shall not be moved to a new location. No license issued pursuant to this paragraph shall permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages by the package for off-the-premises consumption. The provisions of this paragraph do not preclude any bowling establishment from holding a beverage license issued pursuant to any other provision of this section. (d) Any board of county commissioners may be issued a special license which shall be issued in the name of the county and be applicable only in and for facilities which are owned and operated by the county and in which the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages are not otherwise prohibited. The license may be transferred from one qualified county facility to another upon written notification to the department. (e) The owner of a hotel, motel, or motor court may lease his or her restaurant operation to another corporation, individual, or business association that, upon meeting the requirements for a restaurant license set forth in this chapter, may operate independently of the hotel, motel, or motor court and be permitted to provide room service for alcoholic and intoxicating beverages within such hotel, motel, or motor court in which the restaurant is located. (f) In addition to the exceptions set forth in this subsection, no such limitation of the number of licenses as herein provided shall prohibit the issuance of special airport licenses as defined in s. 561.01(12) to restaurants that are a part of, or serve, publicly owned or leased airports. The special airport license provided for herein shall allow for consumption within designated areas of the airport terminal as defined in s. 561.01(13). Any holder of such special license located at a publicly owned and operated airport may sell and serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises to the general public under such license in not more than four places or locations in control of the holder of such license. Any license so issued may not be transferred to a new location, except that a vendor operating a place of business under a special license may transfer such license when the publicly owned or leased airport at which the vendor operates a place of business under a special license moves its terminal facilities on the same airport premises, or when the airport is required by law to move its entire operation to a new location. Any license so issued shall entitle the vendor operating a place of business under such license to sell to airlines vinous beverages and distilled spirits in sealed miniature containers and other alcoholic beverages for consumption on the aircraft using the facility, but only for consumption by the passengers of the aircraft when such aircraft is airborne. (g) In addition to any special licenses issued under the Beverage Law, the division may issue a special license for consumption on the premises only to any public fair or exposition which is organized in accordance with chapter 616. No licensee under this special license shall enter into any exclusive contract for its use. The special license may not be used in connection with any youth agricultural activity or during any regularly scheduled public fair or exposition, and such license may be used only in connection with special events held on the premises of the fairgrounds, which premises are considered to be licensed premises under the dominion and control of the public fair or exposition authority at all times. This special license is not transferable. (h) In addition to any special licenses issued under the Beverage Law, the division may issue a special license for consumption on the premises only to any civic center authority or sports arena authority which is authorized by state law or by a local government ordinance or which civic center or sports arena is otherwise owned by a political subdivision of this state. The license may be transferred to a qualified applicant authorized by contract with the authority to provide food service for the facility. The license shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the authority, and upon termination by any manner of the contract between the authority and the applicant concerning the furnishing of food service, the license shall revert to the authority by operation of law. (i) The division shall not charge a fee in excess of $250 for the license authorized by paragraph (g) or paragraph (h). (j) In addition to any special licenses issued under the Beverage Law, the division may issue a special license for consumption on the premises only to a performing arts center, provided that any consumption of alcoholic beverages under this license, except as part of food and beverage service for banquets or receptions, may occur only in conjunction with an artistic, educational, cultural, promotional, civic, or charitable event occurring on the premises under the authorization of or offered directly by the performing arts center. The license may be transferred to a qualified applicant authorized by contract with the performing arts center to provide food and beverage service for the center. The license shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the performing arts center, and upon termination by any manner of the contract between the performing arts center and the applicant concerning the furnishing of food and beverage service, the license shall revert to the performing arts center by operation of law. The division shall not charge a fee in excess of $400 for the license authorized by this paragraph. (3) The limitation upon the number of such licenses to be issued as herein provided does not apply to existing licenses or to the renewal or transfer of such licenses; but upon the revocation of any existing license, no renewal thereof or new license therefor shall be issued contrary to the limitation herein prescribed. (4) The limitations herein prescribed shall not affect or repeal any existing or future local or special act relating to the limitation by population and exceptions or exemptions from such limitation by population of such licenses within any incorporated city or town or county that may be in conflict herewith. Any license issued under a local or special act relating to the limitation by population shall be subject to all requirements and restrictions contained in the Beverage Law that are applicable to licenses issued under subsection (1). (5) Provisions of subsections (2) and (4) as amended by chapter 57-773, Laws of Florida, shall take effect January 1, 1958, and shall apply only to those places of business licensed to operate after January 1, 1958, and shall in no manner repeal or nullify any license issued under provisions of law which are now operating or will operate prior to the effective date January 1, 1958; and all such places of business shall be exempt from the provisions of this law so long as they are in continuous operation. (6) When additional licenses become available by reason of an increase in population or by reason of a county permitting the sale of intoxicating beverages when such sale has been prohibited, the division may issue the number of new licenses that become available by reason of the last regular population estimate; however, in no event shall any person, firm, or corporation licensed as a vendor under subsection (1) have an interest, directly or indirectly, in more than 30 percent of the number of licenses authorized for issuance in such county. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, any licensed vendor having an interest, directly or indirectly, in more than 30 percent of the licenses authorized for issuance in any one county on July 1, 1981, may continue to qualify for such licenses. (7)(a) There shall be no limitation as to the number of licenses issued pursuant to s. 565.02(4). However, any licenses issued under this section shall be limited to: 1. Subordinate lodges or clubs of national fraternal or benevolent associations; 2. Golf clubs, tennis clubs, and beach or cabana clubs which are municipally or privately owned or leased; 3. Nonprofit corporations or clubs devoted to promoting community, municipal, or county development or any phase of community, municipal, or county development; 4. Clubs fostering and promoting the general welfare and prosperity of members of showmen and amusement enterprises; 5. Clubs assisting, promoting, and developing subordinate lodges or clubs of national fraternal or benevolent associations; and 6. Clubs promoting, developing, and maintaining cultural relations of people of the same nationality. (b) Any corporation, partnership, or individual operating a club owning or leasing and maintaining any bona fide regular, standard golf course consisting of at least nine holes, with clubhouse, locker rooms, and attendant golf facilities and comprising in all at least 35 acres of land owned or leased by such club may be issued a license under s. 565.02(4); but failure of such club to maintain the golf course and golf facilities shall be grounds for revocation of the license. (c) Any corporation, partnership, or individual operating a club owning or leasing and maintaining any bona fide tennis club or four-wall indoor racquetball club consisting of not fewer than 10 regulation-size tennis courts or 10 regulation-size four-wall indoor racquetball courts, or a combination of such courts totaling in the aggregate not fewer than 10 courts, or a combination of 8 such courts and exercise facilities which in square footage total not fewer than the aggregate square foot equivalent of 10 regulation-size courts with clubhouse facilities, pro shop, locker rooms, and attendant tennis or racquetball facilities, all located on a contiguous tract of land owned or leased by such club, may be issued a license under s. 565.02(4); but failure of such club to maintain such courts and facilities shall be grounds for revocation of any such license so issued. Any racquetball or tennis club which has been constructed and completed on or before July 1, 1980, and which contains the requisite number of courts of proper size and attendant facilities may be granted a license without the necessity of securing additional approval from the incorporated municipality or county in which the racquetball or tennis club facility is located. It is intended that this subsection be an exception to s. 562.45(2) preempting the zoning power of local government to the state only in instances involving tennis and racquetball clubs constructed and completed on or before July 1, 1980. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be construed to limit the power of incorporated municipalities or counties to enact ordinances regulating hours of business and prescribing sanitary regulations for such racquetball or tennis club facilities. (d) Any corporation, partnership, or individual operating a club which owns or leases and which maintains any bona fide beach or cabana club consisting of beach facilities, swimming pool, locker rooms or bathroom facilities for at least 100 persons, and a public food service establishment as defined in s. 509.013(5)(a), comprising in all an area of at least 5,000 square feet located on a contiguous tract of land of in excess of 1 acre may be issued a license under s. 565.02(4). The failure of such club to maintain the facilities shall be a ground for revocation of the license. (8) In addition to any licenses that may be issued to restaurants under the provisions of this section, the division is authorized to issue special licenses to qualified applicants whose applications have been approved by the Inter-American Center Authority for use within the confines of the Inter-American Cultural and Trade Center; however, any such license issued pursuant to this subsection shall not permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages by the package for off-premises consumption. (9) In addition to any licenses that may be issued under the provisions of this chapter, the division is authorized to issue special licenses to any county which has a population of at least 1 million persons according to the latest federal census and which owns and operates airport facilities pursuant to chapters 125 and 332, for transfer to qualified applicants who have secured approval from the board of county commissioners of such county for use within the confines of such airport facilities. Such licenses shall not be valid in any location beyond the confines of the terminal facilities of the airport. In the event of expiration or revocation of such licenses, such licenses shall revert to the board of county commissioners automatically, by operation of law. However, no special license issued pursuant to this subsection shall permit the county or its transferee to sell alcoholic beverages by the package for off-premises consumption. (10) In addition to any licenses that may be issued under the provisions of this chapter, the division is authorized to issue a special license to any marketing association of horse breeders organized under the laws of the state. Such license shall be applicable only in and for facilities used by the association for public auction of its products. No license issued pursuant to this subsection shall permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages by the package for off-premises consumption. The provisions of this subsection do not preclude any cooperative marketing association of horse breeders from holding a license issued pursuant to any other provision of this chapter. (11) In addition to any licenses that may be issued under the provisions of this chapter, the division is authorized to issue a special license to historic American Legion Posts in Florida which were chartered prior to September 16, 1919, the date on which the United States Congress issued the National Charter for the American Legion. Any holder of a license issued pursuant to this subsection shall, at its option, be permitted to sell alcoholic beverages to resident guests as well as members and nonresident guests for consumption on the premises only. Revenue from the sale of such alcoholic beverages must be used to operate, maintain, or improve said American Legion Post facilities, grounds, or activities and to maintain an emergency fund not to exceed the costs of operation of the American Legion Post for the prior calendar year. Any remaining revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be donated to local nonprofit charitable organizations on an annual basis. Posts exercising their option under this subsection shall pay an annual license fee of $500. This section shall not apply to any county which has held an election under s. 567.01 and whose electors have voted to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises. (12)(a) In addition to any other licenses issued under the provisions of this chapter, the division is authorized to issue a special license to a person or to an organization for the purpose of authorizing: 1. A sale pursuant to a levy and execution; 2. A sale by an insurance company in possession of alcoholic beverages; 3. A bankruptcy sale; 4. A sale resulting from a license suspension or revocation; 5. A sale of damaged goods by a common carrier; 6. A sale by a bona fide wine collector; or 7. A sale of packaged alcoholic beverages pursuant to part V of chapter 679. (b) A special license shall be issued under this subsection upon filing an application at the district office and paying a $25 fee. Such fee shall be deposited in the Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Trust Fund. (c) A special license is valid for 3 days after the time of its effective date and time as set by the division. A license issued pursuant to this subsection does not permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. (d) A distributor may purchase packaged alcoholic beverages at any sale specified in paragraph (a). (13) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any license to sell or serve alcoholic beverages issued to a port authority, as defined in s. 315.02, entitles that port authority, or the lessee or lessees which it may choose, to sell and serve alcoholic beverages at any terminal within the port jurisdictional boundaries upon annual payment to the division of an annual fee equivalent to the annual license fee for each sales or service location. However, any lessees chosen by the port authority shall meet the criteria for licensure for sales and service of alcoholic beverages.

Every licensee must notify the division in writing of any period during which his or her license is inactive and place the physical license with the division to be held in an inactive status. This paragraph applies to all annual license periods commencing on or after July 1, 1981, but does not apply to licenses issued after September 30, 1988. The division shall, upon written request of the licensee, grant a one-time written waiver or extension of the requirements of this paragraph for a period not to exceed 12 months.

The division may issue a $5,000 fine for a first violation of this paragraph. 3. The division may issue a $10,000 fine for a second or subsequent violation of this paragraph. (2) The division, or any employee designated by it, shall have the power and authority to examine into the business, books, records, and accounts of any licensee, to issue subpoenas to said licensee or any other person from whom information is desired, and to take depositions of witnesses within or without of the state. The division, or any employee designated by it, may administer oaths and issue subpoenas. The provisions of the civil law of the state in relation to enforcing obedience to a subpoena lawfully issued by a judge or other person duly authorized to issue subpoenas under the laws of the state, to issue subpoenas in civil cases, shall apply to a subpoena issued by the division, or any employee designated by it, as authorized in this section, and may be enforced by writ of attachment to be issued by the division, or any employee designated by it, for such witness to compel him or her to attend before the division, or any employee designated by it, and give his or her testimony and to bring and produce such books, papers, and documents as may be required for examination; and the division, or any employee designated by it, may punish any willful refusal to so appear or give testimony by citation of any witness before the circuit court who shall punish such witness for contempt as in cases of refusal to obey the orders and process of the circuit court.

The funds so collected as civil penalties shall be deposited in the state General Revenue Fund. (4) The division may compromise any alleged violations of the Beverage Law, by accepting from the licensee involved an amount not to exceed $1,000 for violations arising out of a single transaction. All funds so collected are to be deposited in the state General Revenue Fund.

In addition, it is the finding of the Legislature that in-store servicing of wine by a distributor is a normal trade or business practice which has substantially contributed to the increase in sales of wine resulting in a substantial benefit to the state by increased tax revenues resulting from the increased sales, and therefore is not a rendering of financial assistance to a vendor or an inducement to purchase wine.

Such tax shall be computed from the reports, books, and records of manufacturers and distributors; and the amount so computed shall be remitted with the report required by s. 561.55 to the division at intervals of 1 month, on or before the 10th of each month, for all beverages sold during the previous calendar month, and such payment of tax shall accompany the report required by s. 561.55. If the monthly tax liability of a manufacturer or distributor exceeds the amount of the bond furnished for payment of taxes, the division, upon a finding based upon substantial and competent evidence that the security of the tax revenue involved is in jeopardy, may require a bond equal to the anticipated tax liability of the manufacturer or distributor. Additionally, the division may increase the frequency of the remittance of the tax when the security of the tax involved is in immediate jeopardy or the financial condition of the manufacturer or distributor is unstable and the potential tax liability exceeds the bond furnished under the Beverage Law. In arriving at a conclusion that the security of the tax revenue involved is in jeopardy, the division shall consider and be guided by the prior history, if any, of the compliance or noncompliance by the manufacturer or distributor with beverage tax obligations; the transient or nontransient nature of the manufacturer or distributorship; the type of inventory, the equity of the manufacturer or distributor therein, and the mobility of such inventory; the financial status of the manufacturer or distributor; and the anticipated tax obligation of the manufacturer or distributor. (2) Whenever the tax on alcoholic beverages under the Beverage Law is expressed in gallons, the conversion factor of 1 liter being the equivalent of 0.26417 gallons shall be used in determining the applicable tax. (3) The use of the word “sold” in subsection (1) shall include alcoholic beverages lost, stolen, or other unaccounted for shortages occurring after entry into the state. All lost, stolen, or other unaccounted for shortages occurring outside this state and supported by documentation shall not be subject to the Florida excise tax upon such alcoholic beverages.
