(2) “Additive product” means any fuel supplement, oil supplement, or any other supplement product added to a motor vehicle for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the performance or improving the longevity of such motor vehicle. The term “additive product” does not include a product applied to the exterior or interior surface of a motor vehicle to protect the appearance of the motor vehicle. (3) “Affiliate” means any entity which exercises control over or is controlled by the motor vehicle service agreement company or insurer, directly or indirectly, through: (a) Equity ownership of voting securities; (b) Common managerial control; or (c) Collusive participation by the management of the motor vehicle service agreement company or insurer and affiliate in the management of the motor vehicle service agreement company or insurer or the affiliate.

(5) “Insurer” means any property or casualty insurer duly authorized to transact such business in this state. (6) “Motor vehicle” means: (a) A self-propelled device operated solely or primarily upon roadways to transport people or property, or the component part of such a self-propelled device, except such term does not include any self-propelled vehicle, or component part of such vehicle, which: 1. Has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or more, and is not a recreational vehicle as defined by s. 320.01(1)(b); 2. Is designed to transport more than 10 passengers, including the driver; or 3.

(7) “Motor vehicle manufacturer” means an entity that: (a) Manufactures or produces motor vehicles and sells motor vehicles under its own name or label; (b) Is a subsidiary of an entity that manufactures or produces motor vehicles; or (c) Is a corporation that owns 100 percent of an entity that manufactures or produces motor vehicles. For purposes of this subsection, an entity qualifies as a subsidiary if 25 percent or more of its voting securities are directly or indirectly owned by an entity that manufactures or produces motor vehicles and sells motor vehicles under its own name or label. (8) “Motor vehicle service agreement” or “service agreement” means any contract or agreement indemnifying the service agreement holder for the motor vehicle listed on the service agreement and arising out of the ownership, operation, and use of the motor vehicle against loss caused by failure of any mechanical or other component part, or any mechanical or other component part that does not function as it was originally intended; however, nothing in this part shall prohibit or affect the giving, free of charge, of the usual performance guarantees by manufacturers or dealers in connection with the sale of motor vehicles. Transactions exempt under s. 624.125 are expressly excluded from this definition and are exempt from the provisions of this part. The term “motor vehicle service agreement” includes any contract or agreement that provides: (a) For the coverage or protection defined in this subsection and which is issued or provided in conjunction with an additive product applied to the motor vehicle that is the subject of such contract or agreement; (b) For payment of vehicle protection expenses. 1.a. “Vehicle protection expenses” means a preestablished flat amount payable for the loss of or damage to a vehicle or expenses incurred by the service agreement holder for loss or damage to a covered vehicle, including, but not limited to, applicable deductibles under a motor vehicle insurance policy; temporary vehicle rental expenses; expenses for a replacement vehicle that is at least the same year, make, and model of the stolen motor vehicle; sales taxes or registration fees for a replacement vehicle that is at least the same year, make, and model of the stolen vehicle; or other incidental expenses specified in the agreement. b. “Vehicle protection product” means a product or system installed or applied to a motor vehicle or designed to prevent the theft of the motor vehicle or assist in the recovery of the stolen motor vehicle. 2. Vehicle protection expenses shall be payable in the event of loss or damage to the vehicle as a result of the failure of the vehicle protection product to prevent the theft of the motor vehicle or to assist in the recovery of the stolen motor vehicle. Vehicle protection expenses covered under the agreement shall be clearly stated in the service agreement form, unless the agreement provides for the payment of a preestablished flat amount, in which case the service agreement form shall clearly identify such amount. 3. Motor vehicle service agreements providing for the payment of vehicle protection expenses shall either: a. Reimburse a service agreement holder for the following expenses, at a minimum: deductibles applicable to comprehensive coverage under the service agreement holder’s motor vehicle insurance policy; temporary vehicle rental expenses; sales taxes and registration fees on a replacement vehicle that is at least the same year, make, and model of the stolen motor vehicle; and the difference between the benefits paid to the service agreement holder for the stolen vehicle under the service agreement holder’s comprehensive coverage and the actual cost of a replacement vehicle that is at least the same year, make, and model of the stolen motor vehicle; or b. Pay a preestablished flat amount to the service agreement holder. Payments shall not duplicate any benefits or expenses paid to the service agreement holder by the insurer providing comprehensive coverage under a motor vehicle insurance policy covering the stolen motor vehicle; however, the payment of vehicle protection expenses at a preestablished flat amount of $5,000 or less does not duplicate any benefits or expenses payable under any comprehensive motor vehicle insurance policy; (c) For repair or replacement of tires or wheels on a motor vehicle damaged as a result of encountering a road hazard; (d) For removal of dents, dings, or creases on a motor vehicle that may be repaired using the process of paintless dent removal without affecting the existing paint finish and without using replacement body panels, or sanding, bonding, or painting; or (e) For replacement of a motor vehicle key or key fob if the key or key fob is inoperable, lost, or stolen.

(10) “Net assets” means the amount by which the total statutory assets exceed total liability, except that assets pledged to secure debts not reflected on the books of the service agreement company shall not be included in net assets. (11) “Person” shall have the same meaning as defined in s. 624.04. (12) “Premium” means the total amount paid by the agreement holder. No “assessment” or any “membership fee,” “policy fee,” “survey fee,” “inspection fee,” “service fee,” “finance fee,” or similar fee shall be charged by the service agreement company. (13) “Rate” means the unit charge by which the measure of exposure in a service agreement is multiplied to determine the premium. (14) “Road hazard” means a danger that is encountered while operating a motor vehicle. The term includes, but is not limited to, potholes, rocks, debris, metal parts, glass, plastic, curbs, and composite scraps. The term does not include any damage caused by collision with another vehicle, vandalism, or other causes usually covered under the comprehensive or collision coverages provided by an automobile physical damage policy. (15) “Salesperson” means any dealership, corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship employed or otherwise retained by an insurer or motor vehicle service agreement company for the purpose of selling or issuing motor vehicle service agreements or for the purpose of soliciting or retaining other salespersons. (16) “Unearned premium” means that portion of the gross written premium which has not been earned on a straight pro rata basis.

(2) “Home warranty” or “warranty” means any contract or agreement whereby a person undertakes to indemnify the warranty holder against the cost of repair or replacement, or actually furnishes repair or replacement, of any structural component or appliance of a home, necessitated by wear and tear or an inherent defect of any such structural component or appliance or necessitated by the failure of an inspection to detect the likelihood of any such loss. However, this part does not prohibit the giving of usual performance guarantees by either the builder of a home or the manufacturer or seller of an appliance, as long as no identifiable charge is made for such guarantee. This part does not permit the provision of indemnification against consequential damages arising from the failure of any structural component or appliance of a home, which practice constitutes the transaction of insurance subject to all requirements of the insurance code. This part does not apply to service contracts entered into between consumers and nonprofit organizations or cooperatives the members of which consist of condominium associations and condominium owners and which perform repairs and maintenance for appliances or maintenance of the residential property. This part does not apply to a contract or agreement offered by a warranty association in compliance with part III, provided such contract or agreement only relates to the systems and appliances of the covered residential property and does not cover any structural component of the residential property. (3) “Home warranty association” means any corporation or any other organization, other than an authorized insurer, issuing home warranties. (4) “Impaired” means having liabilities in excess of assets. (5) “Insolvent” means the inability of a corporation to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business. (6) “Insurance code” means the Florida Insurance Code. (7) “Insurer” means any property or casualty insurer duly authorized to transact such business in this state. (8) “Listing period” means the period of time residential property is listed for sale with a licensed real estate broker, beginning on the date the residence is first listed for sale and ending on either the date the sale of the residence is closed, the date the residence is taken off the market, or the date the listing contract with the real estate broker expires. (9) “Net assets” means the amount by which the total statutory assets of an association exceed the total liabilities of the association. (10) “Person” includes an individual, company, corporation, association, insurer, agent, and every other legal entity. (11) “Premium” means the total consideration received, or to be received, by an insurer or home warranty association for or related to the issuance and delivery of any binder or warranty, including any charges designated as assessments or fees for policies, surveys, inspections, or service or any other charges. (12) “Sales representative” means any person with whom an insurer or home inspection or warranty association has a contract and who is utilized by such insurer or association for the purpose of selling or issuing home warranties. The term includes all employees of an insurer or association engaged directly in the sale or issuance of home warranties. (13) “Structural component” means the roof, plumbing system, electrical system, foundation, basement, walls, ceilings, or floors of a home.
