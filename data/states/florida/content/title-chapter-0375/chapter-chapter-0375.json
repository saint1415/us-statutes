(2) The purpose of the plan is to document recreational supply and demand, describe current recreational opportunities, estimate the need for additional recreational opportunities, and propose means for meeting identified needs. The plan shall describe statewide recreational needs, opportunities, and potential opportunities. (3) The outdoor recreation plan shall be kept current through continual reevaluation and revision. Each agency named in subsection (1) must submit data to the Department of Environmental Protection periodically, upon request, relative to recreational opportunities supplied by that agency, potential recreational opportunities which could be provided by the agency, and any other relevant recreational statistics that the agency may possess. The agencies shall meet periodically at the request of the Department of Environmental Protection to discuss recreational issues. (4) The Department of Environmental Protection may contract with the Government of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality thereof; or with the state or any county, municipality, district authority, or political subdivision; or with any private corporation, partnership, association, or person providing for or relating to the development of outdoor recreation or conservation in accomplishing the purposes of this act. The department may receive and accept from any federal agency, state agency, or other public body grants or loans for or in aid of the purposes of this act; and the department may receive and accept aid, contributions, or loans from any other source of money, property, labor, or other things of value to be held, used, and applied only for the purpose for which such aid, grants, or loans were made.

      "text": "375.031 Acquisition of land; procedures.— (1) The department is empowered and authorized to identify for acquisition lands, water areas, and related resources and to perform all other activities necessary or incident to improving, maintaining, selling, leasing, or disposing of land, water areas, and related resources, and improvements thereon. Prior to the acquisition of such land by the department, the seller of the land shall file a statement with the department disclosing, for at least the last 5 years prior to the conveyance of title to the state, all financial transactions concerning the land, and all parties having a financial interest in any transaction. The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund shall hold title to lands so acquired, but the beneficial use, control, and management shall be with the department. All lands identified for acquisition under this chapter shall be acquired with funds from the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. (2) The department may acquire, control, and oversee the development and use of all land, water areas, and related resources generally classified as outdoor areas and may construct, improve, enlarge, extend, and maintain capital improvements and facilities upon such outdoor areas as needed. In performing these functions, the department shall give full consideration to the recommendations of the committee and of other agencies using or desiring to use land or water areas provided by the department. (3)(a) All land, water areas, and related resources hereafter needed by the state for outdoor recreation, wildlife management, forestry management, nature preservation, water conservation and control, and other similar or related purposes shall be acquired by the Division of State Lands of the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the procedures set forth in chapter 253. (b) On behalf of the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund and before the appraisal of a parcel approved for purchase pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary of Environmental Protection or the director of the Division of State Lands may enter into an option contract to buy such parcel. The option contract shall state that the final purchase price is subject to approval by the board and that this price may not exceed the maximum offer allowed by law. The consideration for such option may not exceed $1,000 or .01 percent of the estimate by the department of the value of the parcel, whichever is greater. (4) The department may acquire by purchase, lease-purchase agreement, or otherwise, on such terms and conditions as it deems wise, any land, water areas, related resources, or other property which it deems is reasonably necessary for outdoor recreation or natural resources conservation under this act, and any and all rights, title, and interest in such land, water areas, related resources, and other property, including any public lands, parks, playgrounds, reservations, roads, or parkways, owned by or in which any county, political subdivision, city, town, village, public agency, or officer of the state has any right, title, or interest, or parts thereof or rights therein and any fee simple absolute or lesser interest in private property, and fee simple absolute in, easement upon, or the benefit of restrictions upon, abutting property to preserve and protect recreation and conservation areas and projects. (5) Land, water areas, and related resources which may be identified through the procedures provided in this act include, but are not limited to, parks and recreation areas, wildlife preserves, forest areas, wetlands, floodways and water storage areas, beaches, water access sites, boating and navigational channels, submerged lands, historical and archaeological sites, and rights-of-way and sites for access roads which may be necessary for maximum development, use, and enjoyment of any outdoor recreation or conservation areas. The terms “land” and “lands” where used singly in this act shall be construed as inclusive of lands, water areas, and related resources. (6) The department may acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, in accordance with the statutes of the state, any land or water areas, related resources, and property and any and all rights, title, and interest in such land or water areas, related resources, and other property which it determines reasonably necessary for the preservation of floodways and water storage areas, boating and navigational channels, rights-of-way for access roads which may be necessary for maximum development and use of any outdoor recreation and conservation areas, and rights-of-way for access which may be necessary for the use and enjoyment of public waterways. (7) The department may contract for the management or lease of acquired land, water areas, and related resources, or improvements thereon, with any state agency for its authorized purposes. The department may, in its discretion, require such state agency to pay, as rentals on such land, water areas, related resources, or improvements, all or any part of the revenues derived from the land. (8) The department may, if it deems it desirable and in the best interest of the program, request the board of trustees to sell or otherwise dispose of any lands or water storage areas acquired under this act. The board of trustees, when so requested, shall offer the lands or water storage areas, on such terms as the department may determine, first to other state agencies and then, if still available, to the county or municipality in which the lands or water storage areas lie. If not acquired by another state agency or local governmental body for beneficial public purposes, the lands or water storage areas shall then be offered by the board of trustees at public sale, after first giving notice of such sale by publication in a newspaper published in the county or counties in which such lands or water storage areas lie not less than once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. All proceeds from the sale or disposition of any lands or water storage areas pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the appropriate trust fund pursuant to s. 253.0341. (9) The department may sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of certain products and user rights in, under, or upon land, water areas, and related resources acquired under the provisions of this act, including, but not limited to, oil and minerals, timber and forest products, sand, gravel, earth, grazing rights, and farming rights on such terms and conditions as it determines, if the sale, lease, or other disposition is not inconsistent with or injurious to the outdoor recreation, conservation, and other purposes for which such lands and water areas were acquired. (10) The department is empowered and authorized to provide matching funds to counties and municipalities of up to 50 percent of the cost of purchasing, exclusive of condemnation, rights-of-way for access roads or walkways to public beaches contiguous with the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of America.

      "text": "375.041 Land Acquisition Trust Fund.— (1) There is created a Land Acquisition Trust Fund within the Department of Environmental Protection. The Land Acquisition Trust Fund is designated by s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution for receipt of certain documentary stamp tax revenue for the uses prescribed therein. The Land Acquisition Trust Fund shall be held and administered by the department. The Land Acquisition Trust Fund shall continue for as long as bonds are outstanding pursuant to s. 215.618 or s. 215.619, or any bonds secured on a parity basis with such bonds, or until the requirement of s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution expires, whichever is later. All moneys deposited into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund shall be trust funds for the uses and purposes herein set forth, within the meaning of s. 215.32(1)(b); and such moneys shall not become or be commingled with the General Revenue Fund of the state, as defined by s. 215.32(1)(a). (2) All moneys and revenue from the sale or other disposition of land, water areas, or related resources acquired on or after July 1, 2015, for the purposes of s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution shall be deposited into or credited to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund, except as otherwise provided pursuant to s. 253.0341. (3) Funds distributed into the Land Acquisition Trust Fund pursuant to s. 201.15 shall be applied: (a) First, to pay debt service or to fund debt service reserve funds, rebate obligations, or other amounts payable with respect to Florida Forever bonds issued under s. 215.618; and pay debt service, provide reserves, and pay rebate obligations and other amounts due with respect to Everglades restoration bonds issued under s. 215.619; and 1 (b) Of the funds remaining after the payments required under paragraph (a), but before funds may be appropriated, pledged, or dedicated for other uses: 1. A minimum of the lesser of 25 percent or $200 million shall be appropriated annually for Everglades projects that implement the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as set forth in s. 373.470, including the Central Everglades Planning Project subject to congressional authorization; the Long-Term Plan as defined in s. 373.4592(2); and the Northern Everglades and Estuaries Protection Program as set forth in s. 373.4595. From these funds, $32 million shall be distributed each fiscal year through the 2023-2024 fiscal year to the South Florida Water Management District for the Long-Term Plan as defined in s. 373.4592(2). After deducting the $32 million distributed under this subparagraph, from the funds remaining, a minimum of the lesser of 76.5 percent or $100 million shall be appropriated each fiscal year through the 2025-2026 fiscal year for the planning, design, engineering, and construction of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as set forth in s. 373.470, including the Central Everglades Planning Project, the Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir Project, the Lake Okeechobee Watershed Project, the C-43 West Basin Storage Reservoir Project, the Indian River Lagoon-South Project, the Western Everglades Restoration Project, and the Picayune Strand Restoration Project. The Department of Environmental Protection and the South Florida Water Management District shall give preference to those Everglades restoration projects that reduce harmful discharges of water from Lake Okeechobee to the St. Lucie or Caloosahatchee estuaries in a timely manner. For the purpose of performing the calculation provided in this subparagraph, the amount of debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) for bonds issued after July 1, 2016, for the purposes set forth under this paragraph shall be added to the amount remaining after the payments required under paragraph (a). The amount of the distribution calculated shall then be reduced by an amount equal to the debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) on bonds issued after July 1, 2016, for the purposes set forth under this subparagraph. 2. A minimum of the lesser of 7.6 percent or $50 million shall be appropriated annually for spring restoration, protection, and management projects. For the purpose of performing the calculation provided in this subparagraph, the amount of debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) for bonds issued after July 1, 2016, for the purposes set forth under this paragraph shall be added to the amount remaining after the payments required under paragraph (a). The amount of the distribution calculated shall then be reduced by an amount equal to the debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) on bonds issued after July 1, 2016, for the purposes set forth under this subparagraph. 3. The sum of $5 million shall be appropriated annually each fiscal year through the 2025-2026 fiscal year to the St. Johns River Water Management District for projects dedicated to the restoration of Lake Apopka. This distribution shall be reduced by an amount equal to the debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) on bonds issued after July 1, 2016, for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. 4. The sum of $64 million is appropriated and shall be transferred to the Everglades Trust Fund for the 2018-2019 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, for the EAA reservoir project pursuant to s. 373.4598. Any funds remaining in any fiscal year shall be made available only for Phase II of the C-51 reservoir project or projects identified in subparagraph 1. and must be used in accordance with laws relating to such projects. Any funds made available for such purposes in a fiscal year are in addition to the amount appropriated under subparagraph 1. This distribution shall be reduced by an amount equal to the debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) on bonds issued after July 1, 2017, for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. 5. The sum of $50 million shall be appropriated annually to the South Florida Water Management District for the Lake Okeechobee Watershed Restoration Project in accordance with s. 373.4599. This distribution must be reduced by an amount equal to the debt service paid pursuant to paragraph (a) on bonds issued after July 1, 2021, for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. 6. The sum of $100 million shall be appropriated annually to the Department of Environmental Protection for the acquisition of land pursuant to s. 259.105. 7. Notwithstanding subparagraphs 3. and 6., for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, funds shall be appropriated as provided in the General Appropriations Act. This subparagraph expires July 1, 2026. (4) Any remaining moneys in the Land Acquisition Trust Fund which are not distributed as provided in subsection (3) may be appropriated from time to time for the purposes set forth in s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution. (5) Moneys accruing to other agencies for the purposes designated in subsection (1) shall be transferred pursuant to nonoperating budget authority under s. 216.181(12). Agencies shall maintain the integrity of such transferred moneys. Any transferred moneys available from reversions or reductions of budget authority in the other agencies shall be transferred back to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund in the Department of Environmental Protection within 15 days after such reversion or reduction and must be available for future appropriation pursuant to s. 28, Art. X of the State Constitution. (6) When the Legislature has authorized the Department of Environmental Protection to condemn a specific parcel of land and such parcel already has been approved for acquisition through the fund, the land may be acquired in accordance with the provisions of chapter 73 or chapter 74, and the fund may be used to pay the condemnation award and all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, associated with condemnation.
