      "text": "327.301 Written reports of accidents.— (1) The operator of a vessel that is in any manner involved in an accident resulting in bodily injury, death, or disappearance of any person or damage to any vessel or other property in an apparent aggregate amount of at least $2,000 shall, within the time limits specified in 33 C.F.R. s. 173.55, forward a written report of the accident to the division. Whenever the operator of the vessel is incapable of making a written report, the owner of the vessel shall, within the time limits specified in 33 C.F.R. s. 173.55, make the report not made by the operator. However, when the investigating officer has made a written report of the accident pursuant to subsection (3), a written report need not be forwarded to the division by the operator. (2) The division may require any operator of a vessel involved in an accident of which written report must be made as provided in this section to file supplemental written reports whenever the original report is insufficient in the opinion of the division, and may require any witness to the accident to render a report to the division. (3) Every law enforcement officer who in the regular course of duty investigates a boating accident that resulted in bodily injury, death, or disappearance of any person or damage to any vessel or other property in an apparent aggregate amount of at least $2,000 shall, within 24 hours after completing the investigation, forward a written report of the accident to the division. However, in every case in which an accident report is required by this section and a written report by a law enforcement officer is not prepared, the law enforcement officer shall provide each party involved in the accident a short-form report, prescribed by the division, to be completed by the party. The short-form report must include, but is not limited to: the date, time, and location of the accident; a description of the vessels involved; the names and addresses of the parties involved; the names and addresses of witnesses; and the name, badge number, and law enforcement agency of the officer investigating the accident. Accident reports made by law enforcement officers may not be used for commercial solicitation purposes; however, use of an accident report for purposes of publication in a newspaper or other news periodical or a radio or television broadcast shall not be construed as a “commercial purpose.” (4) Except as specified in this subsection, each accident report made by a person involved in an accident and any statement made by such person to a law enforcement officer for the purpose of completing an accident report required by this section is without prejudice to the individual reporting. Such report or statement may not be used as evidence in any trial, civil or criminal. However, subject to the applicable rules of evidence, a law enforcement officer who is a witness in a criminal trial may testify as to any statement made to the officer by the person involved in the accident if that person’s privilege against self-incrimination is not violated. The results of breath, urine, and blood tests administered as provided in s. 327.352 or s. 327.353 are not confidential and shall be admissible into evidence in accordance with the provisions of s. 327.354. Accident reports made by persons involved in accidents may not be used for commercial solicitation purposes; however, use of an accident report for purposes of publication in a newspaper or other news periodical or a radio or television broadcast shall not be construed as a “commercial purpose.” (5) For the purposes of this section, a written report includes a report generated through the use of information technology resources as defined in s. 119.011. (6) If the vessel is leased, rented, or chartered at the time of the accident, the person who offered the vessel for lease, rental, or charter shall be responsible for complying with this section and s. 327.30. (7) Any person failing to file the written report required under subsection (1) or a supplemental written report when required by the division under subsection (2) is guilty of a noncriminal infraction.

A person who operates any vessel, or manipulates any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property at a speed or in a manner as to endanger, or likely to endanger, life or limb, or damage the property of, or injure a person is guilty of reckless operation of a vessel. Reckless operation of a vessel includes, but is not limited to, a violation of s. 327.331(6). If a person violates this subsection and the violation: (a) Does not result in an accident, the person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (b) Results in an accident that causes damage to the property or person of another, the person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (c) Results in an accident that causes serious bodily injury as defined in s. 316.192, the person commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (2) A person who operates any vessel upon the waters of this state shall operate the vessel in a reasonable and prudent manner, having regard for other waterborne traffic, posted speed and wake restrictions, and all other attendant circumstances so as not to endanger the life, limb, or property of another person outside the vessel or to endanger the life, limb, or property of another person due to vessel overloading or excessive speed. The failure to operate a vessel in a manner described in this subsection constitutes careless operation. However, vessel wake and shoreline wash resulting from the reasonable and prudent operation of a vessel, absent negligence, does not constitute damage or endangerment to property. A person who violates this subsection commits a noncriminal violation as defined in s. 775.08. (3) Each person operating a vessel upon the waters of this state shall comply with the navigation rules. (a) A person who violates the navigation rules and the violation results in a boating accident causing serious bodily injury as defined in s. 327.353 or death, but the violation does not constitute reckless operation of a vessel, commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (b) A person who violates the navigation rules and the violation does not constitute reckless operation of a vessel commits a noncriminal violation as defined in s. 775.08, punishable as provided in s. 327.73. (c) Law enforcement vessels may deviate from the navigational rules when such diversion is necessary to the performance of their duties and when such deviation may be safely accomplished. (4) Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the ascertainment of fault in vessel operations and boating accidents shall be determined according to the navigation rules.

(2) When a person refuses to submit to a blood test, breath test, or urine test pursuant to s. 327.352, a law enforcement officer authorized to make arrests for violations of this chapter shall file with the clerk of the court, on a form provided by the commission, a certified statement that probable cause existed to arrest the person for a violation of s. 327.35 and that the person refused to submit to a test as required by s. 327.352. Along with the statement, the officer shall also submit a sworn statement on a form provided by the commission that the person has been advised of both the penalties for failure to submit to the blood, breath, or urine test and the procedure for requesting a hearing. (3) A person who has been advised of the penalties pursuant to subsection (2) may, within 30 days afterwards, request a hearing before a county court judge. A request for a hearing tolls the period for payment of the civil penalty, and, if assessment of the civil penalty is sustained by the hearing and any subsequent judicial review, the civil penalty must be paid within 30 days after final disposition. The clerk of the court shall notify the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles of the final disposition of all actions filed under this section by electronic transmission in a format prescribed by the department. When the department receives the final disposition, the department shall enter the disposition on the person’s driving record. (4) It is unlawful for any person who has not paid a civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section, or who has not requested a hearing with respect to the civil penalty, within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice of the civil penalty to operate a vessel upon the waters of this state. Violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (5) Moneys collected by the clerk of the court pursuant to this section shall be disposed of in the following manner: (a) If the arresting officer was employed or appointed by a state law enforcement agency, the moneys shall be deposited into the Marine Resources Conservation Trust Fund and used to directly enhance the ability of law enforcement officers to perform law enforcement functions on state waters. (b) If the arresting officer was employed or appointed by a county or municipal law enforcement agency, the moneys shall be deposited into the law enforcement trust fund of that agency.

Such normal faculties include, but are not limited to, the ability to see, hear, walk, talk, judge distances, drive an automobile, make judgments, act in emergencies, and, in general, normally perform the many mental and physical acts of daily life. (2) At the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while operating a vessel while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that the person’s normal faculties were impaired or to the extent that he or she was deprived of full possession of his or her normal faculties, the results of any test administered in accordance with s. 327.352 or s. 327.353 and this section are admissible into evidence when otherwise admissible, and the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, or by chemical or physical test of the person’s breath, gives rise to the following presumptions: (a) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.05 or less, it is presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (b) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, that fact does not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired but may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (c) If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, that fact is prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. Any person who operates a vessel and who has a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is guilty of operating a vessel with an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level. The presumptions provided in this subsection do not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. (3) A chemical analysis of a person’s blood to determine alcoholic content or a chemical or physical test of a person’s breath, in order to be considered valid under this section, must have been performed substantially in accordance with methods approved by the Department of Law Enforcement and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the department for this purpose. Insubstantial differences between approved techniques and actual testing procedures or insubstantial defects concerning the permit issued by the department, in any individual case, do not render the test or test results invalid. The Department of Law Enforcement may approve satisfactory techniques or methods, ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, and issue permits subject to termination or revocation in accordance with rules adopted by the department. (4) Any person charged with a violation of s. 327.35 is entitled to trial by jury according to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure. (5) An affidavit containing the results of any test of a person’s blood or breath to determine its alcohol content, as authorized by s. 327.352 or s. 327.353, is admissible in evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule in s. 90.803(8) for public records and reports. The affidavit is admissible without further authentication and is presumptive proof of the results of an authorized test to determine alcohol content of the blood or breath if the affidavit discloses: (a) The type of test administered and the procedures followed; (b) The time of the collection of the blood or breath sample analyzed; (c) The numerical results of the test indicating the alcohol content of the blood or breath; (d) The type and status of any permit issued by the Department of Law Enforcement which was held by the person who performed the test; and (e) If the test was administered by means of a breath testing instrument, the date of performance of the most recent required maintenance on such instrument. The Department of Law Enforcement shall provide a form for the affidavit. Admissibility of the affidavit does not abrogate the right of the person tested to subpoena the person who administered the test for examination as an adverse witness at a civil or criminal trial or other proceeding.

(b) Sunset Lake in Miami-Dade County. (c) The sections of Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade County lying between: 1. Palm Island and State Road A1A. 2. Palm Island and Star Island. 3. Palm Island and Hibiscus Island. 4. Palm Island and Watson Island. 5. Rivo Alto Island and Di Lido Island. 6. San Marino Island and Di Lido Island. 7. San Marino Island and San Marco Island. 8. San Marco Island and Biscayne Island. 9. The Sunset Islands. 10. Sunset Island I and State Road 112. (2)(a) Notwithstanding s. 327.60(2)(f), a county, except for Monroe County, may establish, in accordance with this subsection, an anchoring limitation area adjacent to urban areas that have residential docking facilities and significant recreational boating traffic. The aggregate total of anchoring limitation areas in a county may not exceed 10 percent of the county’s delineated navigable-in-fact waterways. As used in this subsection, the term “navigable-in-fact waterways” means waterways that are navigable in their natural or unimproved condition over which useful commerce or public recreation of a substantial and permanent character is or may be conducted in the customary mode of trade and travel on water. The term does not include lakes or streams that are theoretically navigable; have a potential for navigability; or are temporary, precarious, and unprofitable, but the term does include lakes or streams that have practical usefulness to the public as highways for transportation. Each anchoring limitation area must meet all of the following requirements: 1. Be less than 100 acres in size. For purposes of this subsection, the calculated size of the anchoring limitation area does not include any portion of the marked channel of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway contiguous to the anchoring limitation area; 2. Not include any mooring field or marina; and 3. Be clearly marked with all of the following: a. Signs that provide reasonable notice to boaters identifying the duration of time beyond which anchoring is limited and identifying the county ordinance by which the anchoring limitation area was created. b. Buoys. The county that has created an anchoring limitation area shall install and maintain buoys marking the boundary of the anchoring limitation area. The signs and buoys must be permitted and installed in accordance with ss. 327.40 and 327.41 and commission rule. (b) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5), a person may not anchor a vessel for more than 45 consecutive days in any 6-month period in an anchoring limitation area established pursuant to this subsection. (c) A county proposing establishment of an anchoring limitation area in accordance with this subsection shall provide notice to the commission at least 30 days before introducing an ordinance to establish the anchoring limitation area. The commission shall publish notice of the proposed ordinance on its website and distribute such notice through the commission’s Boating and Waterways Section e-mail distribution list for ordinances. (3)(a) Monroe County is designated as an anchoring limitation area within which no less than once every 90 days each vessel anchored within Monroe County on waters of this state within 10 linear nautical miles of a public mooring field or a designated anchoring area must pull anchor and be moved from its location using the vessel’s propulsion system and be reanchored in a new location. The new location must be: 1. No less than one-half linear nautical mile from the vessel’s starting location. A vessel may not be reanchored within one-half linear nautical mile from the vessel’s starting location for at least 90 days; or 2. In a different designated anchoring area. A vessel may not be reanchored in its originating designated anchoring area for at least 90 days after anchoring within a new designated anchoring area. (b) The commission, in consultation with Monroe County and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, shall establish by rule designated anchoring areas throughout the county. The designated anchoring areas must: 1. Specify a maximum vessel draft for each area; 2. Be created only in locations where the water depth is sufficient to allow vessels whose drafts are less than the area’s specified maximum vessel draft to navigate into and out of the areas without grounding or stranding; 3. Not be located over coral reefs or other sensitive fish or wildlife habitat, to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the commission; 4. Not be located in an area subject to ongoing hazardous water currents or tides or containing navigational hazards; and 5. Not be located within navigational channels, setbacks established by the United States Army Corps of Engineers associated with federal channels, areas where anchoring is prohibited pursuant to s. 327.4109, or any other lawfully established areas that prohibit anchoring. (c) Paragraph (a) does not apply to vessels moored to approved and permitted moorings. (d) A vessel upon the waters of this state and within Monroe County for which the owner or occupant has established the vessel as a domicile in accordance with s. 222.17 is exempt from paragraph (a) until at least 100 new moorings are available for public use within 1 mile of the Key West Bight City Dock. Until such time, the commission shall designate the area within 1 mile of the Key West Bight City Dock as a priority for the investigation and removal of derelict vessels. (e) All of the following vessels within Monroe County on waters of this state which are equipped with a marine sanitation device other than a marine composting toilet that processes and manages human waste using technologies that comply with United States Coast Guard requirements must maintain a record of the date of each pumpout of the marine sanitation device and the location of the pumpout station or waste reception facility for 1 year after the date of the pumpout, and the record must indicate that the vessel was pumped out within the last 30 days: 1. A vessel that: a. Has enclosed living spaces or rooms; and b. Is used by a person as a dwelling or living space overnight at any time, notwithstanding whether or not the vessel is also used for navigation. 2. A vessel moored in a public mooring field. (f) This subsection may not be construed to prohibit anchoring for less than 90 days in areas within Monroe County. (4) Notwithstanding subsections (1), (2), and (3), a person may anchor a vessel in an anchoring limitation area during a time that would otherwise be unlawful: (a) If the vessel suffers a mechanical failure that poses an unreasonable risk of harm to the vessel or the persons onboard unless the vessel anchors. The vessel may anchor for 3 business days or until the vessel is repaired, whichever occurs first. (b) If imminent or existing weather conditions in the vicinity of the vessel pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the vessel or the persons onboard unless the vessel anchors. The vessel may anchor until weather conditions no longer pose such risk. During a hurricane or tropical storm, weather conditions are deemed to no longer pose an unreasonable risk of harm when the hurricane or tropical storm warning affecting the area has expired. (c) During events described in s. 327.48 or other special events, including, but not limited to, public music performances, local government waterfront activities, or fireworks displays. A vessel may anchor for the lesser of the duration of the special event or 3 days. (5) This section does not apply to: (a) Vessels owned or operated by a governmental entity for law enforcement, firefighting, military, or rescue purposes. (b) Construction or dredging vessels on an active job site. (c) Vessels actively engaged in commercial fishing. (d) Vessels engaged in recreational fishing if the persons onboard are actively tending hook and line fishing gear or nets. (6)(a) As used in this subsection, the term “law enforcement officer or agency” means an officer or agency authorized to enforce this section pursuant to s. 327.70. (b)1. For a vessel in an anchoring limitation area established pursuant to subsection (2), upon an inquiry by a law enforcement officer or agency, a vessel owner or operator must be given an opportunity to provide proof that the vessel has not exceeded the limitations described in subsection (2). Such proof may include any of the following: a. Documentation showing that the vessel was in another location at least 1 nautical mile away within a period of less than 45 days before the inquiry. b. Electronic evidence, including, but not limited to, navigational devices or tracking devices permanently affixed to the vessel that show the vessel was in another location at least 1 nautical mile away within a period of less than 45 days before the inquiry. 2. If a vessel owner or operator fails or refuses to provide proof that the vessel has not exceeded the limitations described in subsection (2), the law enforcement officer or agency may issue a citation for a violation of this section. (c) A law enforcement officer or agency may remove a vessel from an anchoring limitation area and impound the vessel for up to 48 hours, or cause such removal and impoundment, if the vessel operator, after being issued a citation for a violation of this section: 1. Anchors the vessel in violation of this section within 12 hours after being issued the citation; or 2. Refuses to leave the anchoring limitation area after being directed to do so by a law enforcement officer or agency. (d) A vessel that is the subject of more than three violations within 12 months which result in dispositions other than acquittal or dismissal shall be declared to be a public nuisance and subject to s. 705.103 or, for a derelict vessel, subject to s. 823.11. (e) A law enforcement officer or agency acting under this subsection to remove or impound a vessel, or to cause such removal or impoundment, shall be held harmless for any damage to the vessel resulting from such removal or impoundment unless the damage results from gross negligence or willful misconduct. (f) A contractor performing removal or impoundment services at the direction of a law enforcement officer or agency pursuant to this subsection must: 1. Be licensed in accordance with United States Coast Guard regulations, as applicable. 2. Obtain and carry a current policy issued by a licensed insurance carrier in this state to insure against any accident, loss, injury, property damage, or other casualty caused by or resulting from the contractor’s actions. 3. Be properly equipped to perform such services. (g) In addition to the civil penalty imposed under s. 327.73(1)(z), the operator of a vessel that is removed and impounded pursuant to paragraph (c) must pay all removal and storage fees before the vessel is released. A vessel removed pursuant to paragraph (c) may not be impounded for longer than 48 hours. (7) A violation of this section is punishable as provided in s. 327.73(1)(z).

(2) The commission may establish by rule protection zones that restrict the speed and operation of vessels, or that prohibit or modify the allowable means of anchoring, mooring, beaching, or grounding vessels, to protect and prevent significant harm to first, second, and third magnitude springs and springs groups, including their associated spring runs, as determined by the commission using the most recent Florida Geological Survey springs bulletin. Significant harm includes negative impacts to water quality, water quantity, hydrology, wetlands, and aquatic and wetland-dependent species where the operation, anchoring, mooring, beaching, or grounding of vessels is determined to be the predominant cause of negative impacts. (3) When developing a protection zone, the commission shall do so in consultation and coordination with the water management district, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the governing bodies of the county and municipality, if applicable, in which the zone is located. If the zone includes navigable waters of the United States, the commission shall additionally coordinate with the United States Coast Guard and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. (4) Any individual who operates a vessel in violation of a spring protection zone rule adopted pursuant to this section shall be charged on a uniform boating citation as provided in s. 327.74 and is subject to the penalties provided in s. 327.73(1)(y). (5) Restrictions in a protection zone do not apply: (a) To law enforcement, firefighting, or rescue personnel operating a vessel in the course of performing their official duties; or (b) In emergency situations. However, the emergency operation of a vessel must be a reasonable response given the circumstances. (6) The commission is responsible for the posting and maintenance of regulatory markers identifying protection zones. (7) The commission may adopt rules to implement this section.

(a) The commission may establish boating-restricted areas by rule pursuant to chapter 120. (b) Municipalities and counties may establish the following boating-restricted areas by ordinance, including, notwithstanding the prohibition in s. 327.60(2)(c), within the portion of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway within their jurisdiction: 1. An ordinance establishing an idle speed, no wake boating-restricted area, if the area is: a. Within 500 feet of any boat ramp, hoist, marine railway, or other launching or landing facility available for use by the general boating public on waterways more than 300 feet in width or within 300 feet of any boat ramp, hoist, marine railway, or other launching or landing facility available for use by the general boating public on waterways not exceeding 300 feet in width. b. Within 500 feet of fuel pumps or dispensers at any marine fueling facility that sells motor fuel to the general boating public on waterways more than 300 feet in width or within 300 feet of the fuel pumps or dispensers at any licensed terminal facility that sells motor fuel to the general boating public on waterways not exceeding 300 feet in width. c. Inside or within 300 feet of any lock structure. 2. An ordinance establishing a slow speed, minimum wake boating-restricted area if the area is: a. Within 300 feet of any bridge fender system. b. Within 300 feet of any bridge span presenting a vertical clearance of less than 25 feet or a horizontal clearance of less than 100 feet. c. On a creek, stream, canal, or similar linear waterway if the waterway is less than 75 feet in width from shoreline to shoreline. d. On a lake or pond of less than 10 acres in total surface area. e. Within the boundaries of a permitted public mooring field and a buffer around the mooring field of up to 100 feet. f. Within 500 feet of a sewage pumpout station at any public or private nonresidential marina if the sewage pumpout station is within 100 feet of the marked channel of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway. 3. An ordinance establishing a vessel-exclusion zone if the area is: a. Designated as a public bathing beach or swim area, except that such areas may not be created on waters that include any portion of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway or that are within 100 feet of the marked channel of the Florida Intracoastal Waterway. b. Within 300 feet of a dam, spillway, or flood control structure. Vessel exclusion zones created pursuant to this subparagraph must be marked with uniform waterway markers permitted by the commission in accordance with this chapter. Such zones may not be marked by ropes. (c) Municipalities and counties have the authority to establish by ordinance the following other boating-restricted areas: 1. An ordinance establishing an idle speed, no wake boating-restricted area, if the area is within 300 feet of a confluence of water bodies presenting a blind corner, a bend in a narrow channel or fairway, or such other area if an intervening obstruction to visibility may obscure other vessels or other users of the waterway. 2. An ordinance establishing a slow speed, minimum wake, or numerical speed limit boating-restricted area if the area is: a. Within 300 feet of a confluence of water bodies presenting a blind corner, a bend in a narrow channel or fairway, or such other area if an intervening obstruction to visibility may obscure other vessels or other users of the waterway. b. Subject to unsafe levels of vessel traffic congestion. c. Subject to hazardous water levels or currents, or containing other navigational hazards. d. An area that accident reports, uniform boating citations, vessel traffic studies, or other creditable data demonstrate to present a significant risk of collision or a significant threat to boating safety. 3. An ordinance establishing a vessel-exclusion zone if the area is reserved exclusively: a. As a canoe trail or otherwise limited to vessels under oars or under sail. b. For a particular activity and user group separation must be imposed to protect the safety of those participating in such activity. Any of the ordinances adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not take effect until the commission has reviewed the ordinance and determined by substantial competent evidence that the ordinance is necessary to protect public safety pursuant to this paragraph. Any application for approval of an ordinance shall be reviewed and acted upon within 90 days after receipt of a completed application. Within 30 days after a municipality or county submits an application for approval to the commission, the commission shall advise the municipality or county as to what information, if any, is needed to deem the application complete. An application shall be considered complete upon receipt of all requested information and correction of any error or omission for which the applicant was timely notified or when the time for such notification has expired. The commission’s action on the application shall be subject to review under chapter 120. The commission shall initiate rulemaking no later than January 1, 2010, to provide criteria and procedures for reviewing applications and procedures for providing for public notice and participation pursuant to this paragraph. (d) Owners of private submerged lands that are adjacent to Outstanding Florida Waters, as defined in s. 403.061(28), or an aquatic preserve established under ss. 258.39-258.399 may request that the commission establish boating-restricted areas solely to protect any seagrass and contiguous seagrass habitat within their private property boundaries from seagrass scarring due to propeller dredging. Owners making a request pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate to the commission clear ownership of the submerged lands. The commission shall adopt rules to implement this paragraph, including, but not limited to, establishing an application process and criteria for meeting the requirements of this paragraph. Each approved boating-restricted area shall be established by commission rule. For marking boating-restricted zones established pursuant to this paragraph, owners of privately submerged lands shall apply to the commission for a uniform waterway marker permit in accordance with ss. 327.40 and 327.41, and shall be responsible for marking the boating-restricted zone in accordance with the terms of the permit. (e) As used in this section, the term “seagrass” has the same meaning as in s. 253.04. (2) Each such boating-restricted area shall be developed in consultation and coordination with the governing body of the county or municipality in which the boating-restricted area is located and, when the boating-restricted area is to be on the navigable waters of the United States, with the United States Coast Guard and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. (3) It is unlawful for any person to operate a vessel in a prohibited manner or to carry on any prohibited activity, as defined in this chapter, within a boating-restricted area which has been clearly marked by regulatory markers as authorized under this chapter. (4) Restrictions in a boating-restricted area established pursuant to this section shall not apply in the case of an emergency or to a law enforcement, firefighting, or rescue vessel owned or operated by a governmental entity.

Fully off plane and completely settled into the water; and 2. Proceeding without wake or with minimum wake. A vessel that is required to operate at slow speed, minimum wake may not proceed at a speed greater than a speed that is reasonable and prudent to avoid the creation of an excessive wake or other hazardous condition under the existing circumstances. (b) Is not proceeding at slow speed, minimum wake if it is: 1. Operating on plane; 2. In the process of coming off plane and settling into the water or getting on plane; or 3. Operating at a speed that creates a wake that unreasonably or unnecessarily endangers other vessels. (2) A person may not operate a vessel faster than slow speed, minimum wake within 300 feet of any emergency vessel, including, but not limited to, a law enforcement vessel, United States Coast Guard vessel, or firefighting vessel, when such emergency vessel’s emergency lights are activated. (3)(a) A person may not operate a vessel faster than slow speed, minimum wake within 300 feet of any construction vessel or barge when the vessel or barge is displaying an orange flag from a pole extending: 1. At least 10 feet above the tallest portion of the vessel or barge, indicating that the vessel or barge is actively engaged in construction operations; or 2. At least 5 feet above any superstructure permanently installed upon the vessel or barge, indicating that the vessel or barge is actively engaged in construction operations. (b) A flag displayed on a construction vessel or barge pursuant to this subsection must: 1. Be at least 2 feet by 3 feet in size. 2. Have a wire or other stiffener or be otherwise constructed to ensure that the flag remains fully unfurled and extended in the absence of a wind or breeze. 3. Be displayed so that the visibility of the flag is not obscured in any direction. (c) In periods of low visibility, including any time between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise, a person may not be cited for a violation of this subsection unless the orange flag is illuminated and visible from a distance of at least 2 nautical miles. Such illumination does not relieve the construction vessel or barge from complying with all navigation rules. (4)(a) A person operating a vessel in violation of this section commits a noncriminal infraction, punishable as provided in s. 327.73. (b) The owner of, or party who is responsible for, a construction vessel or barge who displays an orange flag on the vessel or barge when it is not actively engaged in construction operations commits a noncriminal infraction, punishable as provided in s. 327.73. (5) The speed and penalty provisions of this section do not apply to a law enforcement, firefighting, or rescue vessel that is owned or operated by a governmental entity.

On a vessel other than a houseboat, the toilet may be portable or permanently installed. Every permanently installed toilet shall be properly attached to the appropriate United States Coast Guard certified or labeled marine sanitation device. (2) Every houseboat shall be equipped with at least one permanently installed toilet which shall be properly connected to a United States Coast Guard certified or labeled Type III marine sanitation device. If the toilet is simultaneously connected to both a Type III marine sanitation device and to another approved marine sanitation device, the valve or other mechanism selecting between the two marine sanitation devices shall be set to direct all sewage to the Type III marine sanitation device and, while the vessel is on the waters of the state, shall be locked or otherwise secured by the boat operator, so as to prevent resetting. (3) Every floating structure that has an enclosed living space with berthing facilities, or working space with public access, must be equipped with a permanently installed toilet properly connected to a Type III marine sanitation device or permanently attached via plumbing to shoreside sewage disposal. No structure shall be plumbed so as to permit the discharge of sewage into the waters of the state. (4)(a) Raw sewage shall not be discharged from any vessel, including houseboats, or any floating structure in Florida waters. The operator of any vessel which is plumbed so that a toilet may be flushed directly into the water or so that a holding tank may be emptied into the water shall, while the vessel is on the waters of the state, set the valve or other mechanism directing the sewage so as to prevent direct discharge and lock or otherwise secure the valve so as to prevent resetting. (b) All waste from Type III marine sanitation devices shall be disposed in an approved sewage pumpout facility. (c) All waste from portable toilets shall be disposed in an approved waste reception facility. (5) Every vessel owner, operator, and occupant shall comply with United States Coast Guard regulations pertaining to marine sanitation devices and with United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations pertaining to areas in which the discharge of sewage, treated or untreated, is prohibited. (6)(a) A violation of this section is a noncriminal infraction, punishable as provided in s. 327.73. Each violation shall be a separate offense. The owner and operator of any vessel shall be jointly and severally liable for the civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section. (b) All civil penalties imposed and collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Marine Resources Conservation Trust Fund and shall be used: to implement, administer, and enforce this act; to construct, renovate, or operate pumpout stations and waste reception facilities; and to conduct a program to educate vessel operators about the problem of human body waste discharges from vessels and inform them of the location of pumpout stations and waste reception facilities. (7) A vessel or floating structure operated or occupied on the waters of this state in violation of this section is declared a nuisance and a hazard to public safety and health. The owner or operator of a vessel or floating structure cited for violating this section shall, within 30 days following the issuance of the citation, correct the violation for which the citation was issued or remove the vessel or floating structure from the waters of this state. If the violation is not corrected within the 30 days and the vessel or floating structure remains on the waters of this state in violation of this section, law enforcement officers charged with the enforcement of this chapter under s. 327.70 shall apply to the appropriate court in the county in which the vessel or floating structure is located to order or otherwise cause the removal of such vessel or floating structure from the waters of this state at the owner’s expense. If the owner cannot be found or otherwise fails to pay the removal costs, the provisions of s. 328.17 shall apply. If the proceeds under s. 328.17 are not sufficient to pay all removal costs, funds appropriated from the Marine Resources Conservation Trust Fund pursuant to paragraph (6)(b) or s. 328.72(15)(c) may be used. (8) The owner or operator of a live-aboard vessel as defined in s. 327.02(23), or a houseboat as defined in s. 327.02(17), that is equipped with a marine sanitation device must maintain a record of the date of each pumpout of the marine sanitation device and the location of the pumpout station or waste reception facility. Each record must be maintained for 1 year after the date of the pumpout. This subsection does not apply to marine compost toilets that process and manage human waste using marine compost toilet technologies that comply with United States Coast Guard requirements.

(2) Nothing in this section may be construed to restrict the ability of an owner of a vessel or the owner’s authorized representative to remove a vessel voluntarily from a marina at any time or to restrict a marina owner from dictating the kind of cleats, ropes, fenders, and other measures that must be used on vessels as a condition of use of a marina. After a tropical storm or hurricane watch has been issued, a marina owner or operator, or an employee or agent of such owner or operator, may take reasonable actions to further secure any vessel within the marina to minimize damage to a vessel and to protect marina property, private property, and the environment and may charge a reasonable fee for such services. (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in order to minimize damage to a vessel and to protect marina property, private property, and the environment, a marina owner may provide by contract that in the event a vessel owner fails to promptly remove a vessel from a marina after a tropical storm or hurricane watch has been issued, the marina owner, operator, employee, or agent may remove the vessel, if reasonable, from its slip or take whatever reasonable actions are deemed necessary to properly secure a vessel to minimize damage to a vessel and to protect marina property, private property, and the environment and may charge the vessel owner a reasonable fee for any such services rendered. In order to add such a provision to a contract, the marina owner must provide notice to the vessel owner in any such contract in a font size of at least 10 points and in substantially the following form: NOTICE TO VESSEL OWNER The undersigned hereby informs you that in the event you fail to remove your vessel from the marina promptly (timeframe to be determined between the marina owner or operator and the vessel owner) after the issuance of a tropical storm or hurricane watch for (insert geographic area), Florida, under Florida law, the undersigned or his or her employees or agents are authorized to remove your vessel, if reasonable, from its slip or take any and all other reasonable actions deemed appropriate by the undersigned or his or her employees or agents in order to better secure your vessel and to protect marina property, private property, and the environment. You are further notified that you may be charged a reasonable fee for any such action. (4) A marina owner, operator, employee, or agent shall not be held liable for any damage incurred to a vessel from storms or hurricanes and is held harmless as a result of such actions. Nothing in this section may be construed to provide immunity to a marina operator, employee, or agent for any damage caused by intentional acts or negligence when removing or securing a vessel as permitted under this section. (5) Upon the issuance of a hurricane watch affecting the waters of marinas located in a deepwater seaport, vessels under 500 gross tons may not remain in the waters of such marinas that have been deemed not suitable for refuge during a hurricane. Vessel owners shall promptly remove their vessels from the waterways upon issuance of an evacuation order by the deepwater seaport. If the United States Coast Guard captain of the port sets the port condition to “Yankee” and a vessel owner has failed to remove a vessel from the waterway, the marina owner, operator, employee, or agent, regardless of any existing contractual provisions between the marina owner and the vessel owner, shall remove the vessel, or cause the vessel to be removed, if reasonable, from its slip and may charge the vessel owner a reasonable fee for any such services rendered. A marina owner, operator, employee, or agent may not be held liable for any damage incurred to a vessel from a hurricane and is held harmless as a result of such actions to remove the vessel from the waterways. After the hurricane watch has been issued, the owner or operator of any vessel that has not been removed from the waterway of the marina, pursuant to an order from the deepwater seaport, may be subject to a fine, which may be imposed and collected by the deepwater seaport that issued the evacuation order if assessed, in an amount not exceeding three times the cost associated with removing the vessel from the waterway. This section does not provide immunity to a marina owner, operator, employee, or agent for any damage caused by intentional acts or negligence when removing a vessel pursuant to this section; require a deepwater seaport to issue an order to evacuate vessels; or require a deepwater seaport to impose and collect fines for failure to remove vessels from its waterways. For purposes of this subsection, the term “deepwater seaport” means the port waters, dredged material management sites, port harbors, navigation channels, turning basins, and harbor berths used for deepwater commercial navigation.

(2) This chapter and chapter 328 do not prevent the adoption of any ordinance or local regulation relating to operation of vessels, except that a county or municipality may not enact, continue in effect, or enforce any ordinance or local regulation: (a) Establishing a vessel or associated equipment performance or other safety standard, imposing a requirement for associated equipment, or regulating the carrying or use of marine safety articles; (b) Relating to the design, manufacture, or installation of any marine sanitation device on any vessel, except as authorized in subsection (4); (c) Regulating any vessel upon the Florida Intracoastal Waterway; (d) Discriminating against personal watercraft; (e) Discriminating against airboats, for ordinances adopted after July 1, 2006, unless adopted by a two-thirds vote of the governing body enacting such ordinance; (f) Regulating the anchoring of vessels outside the marked boundaries of mooring fields permitted as provided in s. 327.40, except for: 1. Live-aboard vessels; 2. Commercial vessels, excluding commercial fishing vessels; and 3. Vessels anchored for a period of 1 hour or more between one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise for more than 30 days in any 6-month period within the jurisdiction of a county with a population of 1.5 million or more, excluding any time the vessel is anchored overnight within the boundaries of a marked mooring field or any time the vessel is anchored overnight for the purpose of completing permitted marine construction, installation, or maintenance work; (g) Regulating engine or exhaust noise, except as provided in s. 327.65; or (h) That conflicts with any provisions of this chapter or any amendments thereto or rules adopted thereunder. (3) This section does not prohibit local governmental authorities from the enactment or enforcement of regulations that prohibit or restrict the mooring or anchoring of floating structures, live-aboard vessels, or commercial vessels, excluding commercial fishing vessels, within their jurisdictions or of any vessels within the marked boundaries of mooring fields permitted as provided in s. 327.40. (4)(a) A local government may enact and enforce regulations that require owners or operators of vessels or floating structures subject to the marine sanitation requirements of s. 327.53 to provide proof of proper sewage disposal by means of an approved sewage pumpout service, approved sewage pumpout facility, or approved waste reception facility when anchored or moored for more than 10 consecutive days within the following areas: 1. Marked boundaries of a permitted mooring field under the jurisdiction of the local government; 2. No-discharge zones as published in Volume 53, No. 13 of the Federal Register, page 1678 (1988); Volume 64, No. 164 of the Federal Register, pages 46390-46391 (1999); and Volume 67, No. 98 of the Federal Register, pages 35735-35743 (2002); or 3. No-discharge zones established pursuant to 40 C.F.R. s. 1700.10. (b) Before a local government may adopt an ordinance to enact and enforce such regulations, the local government must ensure that there are approved sewage pumpout services, approved sewage pumpout facilities, or approved waste reception facilities available within its jurisdiction. Any ordinance adopted pursuant to this subsection may not take effect until reviewed and approved as consistent with this subsection by the commission. (c) Upon approval of the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to 33 U.S.C. s. 1322, a county designated as a rural area of opportunity may create a no-discharge zone for freshwater water bodies within the county’s jurisdiction to prohibit treated and untreated sewage discharges from floating structures and live-aboard vessels not capable of being used as a means of transportation and from houseboats. Within no-discharge zone boundaries, operators of such floating structures, live-aboard vessels, and houseboats shall retain their sewage on board for discharge at a pumpout facility or for discharge more than 3 miles off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean or more than 9 miles off the coast in the Gulf of America. Violations of this paragraph are punishable as provided in s. 327.53(6) and (7). (d) This subsection does not prohibit a local government from enacting or enforcing such sewage pumpout requirements for live-aboard vessels, floating structures, and commercial vessels, excluding commercial fishing vessels, within any areas of its jurisdiction. (e) The commission may adopt rules to implement this subsection. (5) A local government may enact and enforce regulations to implement the procedures for abandoned or lost property that allow the local law enforcement agency to remove a vessel affixed to a public dock or mooring within its jurisdiction that is abandoned or lost property pursuant to s. 705.103(1). Such regulation must require the local law enforcement agency to post a written notice at least 24 hours before removing the vessel.

Possess or operate any vessel that has been equipped with tanks, bladders, drums, or other containers designed or intended to hold gasoline, or install or maintain such containers in a vessel, if such containers do not conform to federal regulations or have not been approved by the United States Coast Guard by inspection or special permit. 2. Transport any gasoline in an approved portable container when the container is in a compartment that is not ventilated in strict compliance with United States Coast Guard regulations pertaining to ventilation of compartments containing gasoline tanks. (b) A person who violates paragraph (a) commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. (2)(a) Gasoline possessed or transported in violation of this section and all containers holding such gasoline are declared to be a public nuisance. A law enforcement agency discovering gasoline possessed or transported in violation of paragraph (1)(a) shall abate the nuisance by removing the gasoline and containers from the vessel and from the waters of this state. A law enforcement agency that removes gasoline or containers pursuant to this subsection may elect to: 1. Retain the property for the agency’s own use; 2. Transfer the property to another unit of state or local government; 3. Donate the property to a charitable organization; or 4. Sell the property at public sale pursuant to s. 705.103.

(3) All conveyances, vessels, vehicles, and other equipment described in paragraph (1)(a) or used in the commission of a violation of paragraph (1)(a), other than gasoline or containers removed as provided in subsection (2), are declared to be contraband. (a) Upon conviction of a person arrested for a violation of paragraph (1)(a), the judge shall issue an order adjudging and ordering that all conveyances, vessels, vehicles, and other equipment used in the violation shall be forfeited to the arresting agency. The requirement for a conviction before forfeiture of property establishes to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt that the property was used in connection with the violation resulting in the conviction, and the procedures of chapter 932 do not apply to any forfeiture of property under this subsection following a conviction. (b) In the absence of an arrest or conviction, any such conveyance, vessel, vehicle, or other equipment used in violation of paragraph (1)(a) shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture as provided by the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. (c) As used in this subsection, the term “conviction” means a finding of guilt or the acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld or whether imposition of sentence is withheld, deferred, or suspended.

The commission, in coordination with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, shall create a “Florida Freedom Boater” safety inspection decal for issue at the time of registration or renewal, signifying that the vessel is deemed to have met the safety equipment carriage and use requirements of this chapter. Upon demonstrated compliance with the safety equipment carriage and use requirements of this chapter at the time of registration or renewal, the operator of a vessel shall be issued a “Florida Freedom Boater” safety inspection decal. The commission may designate by rule the timeframe for expiration of, and the specific design for, the “Florida Freedom Boater” safety inspection decal. However, a decal may not be valid for less than 1 calendar year or more than 5 years at the time of issue and, at a minimum, must meet the standards specified in this paragraph. 2. The “Florida Freedom Boater” safety inspection decal must be located within 6 inches of the inspected vessel’s properly displayed vessel registration decal. For nonmotorized vessels that are not required to be registered, the “Florida Freedom Boater” safety inspection decal must be located above the waterline on the forward half of the port side of the vessel. (b) This subsection does not restrict a law enforcement officer from stopping a vessel for any other lawful purpose when the officer has probable cause to believe that a violation of this chapter has occurred or is occurring. (3)(a) Noncriminal violations of the following statutes may be enforced by a uniform boating citation mailed to the registered owner of an unattended vessel anchored, aground, or moored on the waters of this state: 1. Section 327.33(3)(b), relating to navigation rules. 2. Section 327.44, relating to interference with navigation. 3. Section 327.50(2), relating to required lights and shapes. 4. Section 327.53, relating to marine sanitation. 5. Section 328.48(5), relating to display of decal. 6. Section 328.52(2), relating to display of number. 7. Section 327.4107, relating to vessels at risk of becoming derelict. 8. Section 327.4109, relating to prohibited anchoring or mooring. 9. Section 328.72(13), relating to expired registration. 10. Section 327.4111, relating to long-term anchoring. (b) Citations issued to livery vessels under this subsection are the responsibility of the lessee of the vessel if the livery has included a warning of this responsibility as a part of the rental agreement and has provided to the agency issuing the citation the name, address, and date of birth of the lessee when requested by that agency. The livery is not responsible for the payment of citations if the livery provides the required warning and lessee information. (c) A noncriminal violation of s. 327.4108 may be enforced by a uniform boating citation issued to the operator of a vessel unlawfully anchored in an anchoring limitation area. (d) A noncriminal violation of s. 327.4109 may be enforced by a uniform boating citation issued to the owner or operator of a vessel or floating structure unlawfully anchored or moored in a prohibited area. (e) A noncriminal violation of s. 327.4111 may be enforced by a uniform boating citation issued to the owner or operator of a vessel engaged in unlawful long-term anchoring. (4) Such officers shall have the power and duty to issue such orders and to make such investigations, reports, and arrests in connection with any violation of the provisions of this chapter and chapter 328 as are necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this chapter and chapter 328. (5) The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or any other law enforcement agency may make any investigation necessary to secure information required to carry out and enforce the provisions of this chapter and chapter 328.

A person cited for a violation of this subsection is deemed to be charged with a noncriminal infraction, must be cited for such an infraction, and must be cited to appear before the county court. The civil penalty for any such infraction is $100, except as otherwise provided in this section. A person who fails to appear or otherwise properly respond to a uniform boating citation, in addition to the charge relating to the violation of the boating laws of this state, must be charged with the offense of failing to respond to such citation and, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. A written warning to this effect must be provided at the time such uniform boating citation is issued. (2) Any person cited for an infraction under this section may: (a) Post a bond, which shall be equal in amount to the applicable civil penalty; or (b) Sign and accept a citation indicating a promise to appear. The officer may indicate on the citation the time and location of the scheduled hearing and shall indicate the applicable civil penalty.

(4) Any person charged with a noncriminal infraction under this section may: (a) Pay the civil penalty, either by mail or in person, within 30 days of the date of receiving the citation; or, (b) If he or she has posted bond, forfeit bond by not appearing at the designated time and location. If the person cited follows either of the above procedures, he or she shall be deemed to have admitted the noncriminal infraction and to have waived the right to a hearing on the issue of commission of the infraction. Such admission shall not be used as evidence in any other proceedings. If a person who is cited for a violation of s. 327.395 can show a boating safety identification card issued to that person and valid at the time of the citation, the clerk of the court may dismiss the case and may assess a dismissal fee of up to $10, from which the clerk shall remit $2.50 to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund.

(5) Any person electing to appear before the county court or who is required so to appear shall be deemed to have waived the limitations on the civil penalty specified in subsection (1). The court, after a hearing, shall make a determination as to whether an infraction has been committed. If the commission of an infraction has been proven, the court may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $500 or a higher amount as specified in subsection (1). (6) At a hearing under this chapter the commission of a charged infraction must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (7) If a person is found by the hearing official to have committed an infraction, he or she may appeal that finding to the circuit court. (8) All fees and civil penalties assessed and collected pursuant to this section shall be remitted by the clerk of the court to the Department of Revenue to be deposited into the Marine Resources Conservation Trust Fund for boating safety education or law enforcement purposes. (9)(a) Any person who fails to comply with the court’s requirements or who fails to pay the civil penalties specified in this section within the 30-day period provided for in s. 327.72 must pay an additional court cost of up to $20, which shall be used by the clerks of the courts to defray the costs of tracking unpaid uniform boating citations, from which the clerk shall remit $2 to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund. (b) Any person who fails to comply with the court’s requirements as to civil penalties specified in this section due to demonstrated financial hardship shall be authorized to satisfy such civil penalties by public works or community service. Each hour of such service shall be applied, at the rate of the minimum wage, toward payment of the person’s civil penalties; provided, however, that if the person has a trade or profession for which there is a community service need and application, the rate for each hour of such service shall be the average standard wage for such trade or profession. Any person who fails to comply with the court’s requirements as to such civil penalties who does not demonstrate financial hardship may also, at the discretion of the court, be authorized to satisfy such civil penalties by public works or community service in the same manner. (c) If the noncriminal infraction has caused or resulted in the death of another, the court may require the person who committed the infraction to perform 120 community service hours in addition to any other penalties. (10) Any person cited for any noncriminal infraction which results in an accident that causes the death of another, or which results in an accident that causes “serious bodily injury” of another as defined in s. 327.353(1), shall not have the provisions of subsection (4) available to him or her but must appear before the designated official at the time and location of the scheduled hearing. (11)(a) Court costs that are to be in addition to the stated civil penalty shall be imposed by the court in an amount not less than the following: 1. For swimming or diving infractions, $4, from which the clerk shall remit $1 to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund. 2. For nonmoving boating infractions, $18, from which the clerk shall remit $12 to the Department of Revenue for deposit into the General Revenue Fund. 3.

(b) In addition to the court cost assessed under paragraph (a), the court shall impose a $3 court cost for each noncriminal infraction, to be distributed as provided in s. 938.01, and a $2 court cost as provided in s. 938.15 when assessed by a municipality or county. Court costs imposed under this subsection may not exceed $45. A criminal justice selection center or both local criminal justice access and assessment centers may be funded from these court costs.

The clerk of the court shall remit all fines assessed and collected under this subsection to the Department of Revenue to be deposited into the Marine Resources Conservation Trust Fund to support law enforcement activities. (3) For the purposes of this section, “conviction” means a finding of guilt, or the acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether or not adjudication was withheld or whether imposition of sentence was withheld, deferred, or suspended. Any person who operates a vessel on the waters of this state in violation of the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
