      "heading": "Lien of taxes; application.",
      "text": "197.122 Lien of taxes; application.— (1) All taxes imposed pursuant to the State Constitution and laws of this state shall be a first lien, superior to all other liens, on any property against which the taxes have been assessed and shall continue in full force from January 1 of the year the taxes were levied until discharged by payment or until barred under chapter 95. If the property to which the lien applies cannot be located in the county or the sale of the property is insufficient to pay all delinquent taxes, interest, fees, and costs due, a personal property tax lien applies against all other personal property of the taxpayer in the county. However, a lien against other personal property does not apply against property that has been sold and is subordinate to any valid prior or subsequent liens against such other property. An act of omission or commission on the part of a property appraiser, tax collector, board of county commissioners, clerk of the circuit court, or county comptroller, or their deputies or assistants, or newspaper in which an advertisement of sale may be published does not defeat the payment of taxes, interest, fees, and costs due and may be corrected at any time by the party responsible in the same manner as provided by law for performing acts in the first place. Amounts so corrected shall be deemed to be valid ab initio and do not affect the collection of the tax. All owners of property are held to know that taxes are due and payable annually and are responsible for ascertaining the amount of current and delinquent taxes and paying them before April 1 of the year following the year in which taxes are assessed. A sale or conveyance of real or personal property for nonpayment of taxes may not be held invalid except upon proof that: (a) The property was not subject to taxation; (b) The taxes were paid before the sale of personal property; or (c) The real property was redeemed before receipt by the clerk of the court of full payment for a deed based upon a certificate issued for nonpayment of taxes, including all recording fees and documentary stamps. (2) A lien created through the sale of a tax certificate may not be foreclosed or enforced in any manner except as prescribed in this chapter. (3) A property appraiser may also correct a material mistake of fact relating to an essential condition of the subject property to reduce an assessment if to do so requires only the exercise of judgment as to the effect of the mistake of fact on the assessed or taxable value of the property. (a) As used in this subsection, the term “an essential condition of the subject property” means a characteristic of the subject parcel, including only: 1. Environmental restrictions, zoning restrictions, or restrictions on permissible use; 2. Acreage; 3. Wetlands or other environmental lands that are or have been restricted in use because of such environmental features; 4. Access to usable land; 5. Any characteristic of the subject parcel which, in the property appraiser’s opinion, caused the appraisal to be clearly erroneous; or 6. Depreciation of the property that was based on a latent defect of the property which existed but was not readily discernible by inspection on January 1, but not depreciation from any other cause. (b) The material mistake of fact may be corrected by the property appraiser, in the same manner as provided by law for performing the act in the first place only within 1 year after the approval of the tax roll pursuant to s. 193.1142. If corrected, the tax roll becomes valid ab initio and does not affect the enforcement of the collection of the tax. If the correction results in a refund of taxes paid on the basis of an erroneous assessment included on the current year’s tax roll, the property appraiser may request the department to pass upon the refund request pursuant to s. 197.182 or may submit the correction and refund order directly to the tax collector in accordance with the notice provisions of s. 197.182(2). Corrections to tax rolls for previous years which result in refunds must be made pursuant to s. 197.182.

(3) A discount rate of 4 percent applies for 30 days after the sending of a tax notice resulting from the action of a value adjustment board when a corrected tax notice is issued before the taxes become delinquent pursuant to s. 197.333. Thereafter, the regular discount periods apply.

An overpayment has been made. 2. A payment has been made when no tax was due. 3. A bona fide controversy exists between the tax collector and the taxpayer as to the liability of the taxpayer for the payment of the tax claimed to be due, the taxpayer pays the amount claimed by the tax collector to be due, and it is finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction that the taxpayer was not liable for the payment of the tax or any part thereof. 4. A payment for a delinquent tax has been made in error by a taxpayer to the tax collector and within 12 months after the date of the erroneous payment and before any transfer of the assessed property to a third party for consideration, the party seeking a refund makes demand for reimbursement of the erroneous payment upon the owner of the property on which the taxes were erroneously paid and reimbursement of the erroneous payment is not received within 45 days after such demand. The demand for reimbursement must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a copy of the demand must be sent to the tax collector. If the payment was made in error by the taxpayer because of an error in the tax notice sent to the taxpayer, refund must be made as provided in paragraph (d). 5. A payment for a tax that has not become delinquent, has been made in error by a taxpayer to the tax collector and within 18 months after the date of the erroneous payment and before any transfer of the assessed property to a third party for consideration, the party seeking a refund makes a demand for reimbursement of the erroneous payment upon the owner of the property on which the taxes were erroneously paid, and reimbursement of the erroneous payment is not received within 45 days after such demand. The demand for reimbursement must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a copy of the demand must be sent to the tax collector. If the payment was made in error by the taxpayer because of an error in the tax notice sent to the taxpayer, refund must be made as provided in paragraph (d). 6. A payment is made for a tax certificate that is subsequently corrected or amended or is subsequently determined to be void under s. 197.443. (b) Refunds that have been ordered by a court and refunds that do not result from changes made in the assessed value on a tax roll certified to the tax collector shall be made directly by the tax collector without order from the department and shall be made from undistributed funds without approval of the various taxing authorities. (c) Overpayments in the amount of $10 or less may be retained by the tax collector unless a written claim for a refund is received from the taxpayer. Overpayments of more than $10 resulting from taxpayer error, if identified within the 4-year period of limitation, shall be automatically refunded to the taxpayer. Such refunds do not require approval from the department. (d) If a payment has been made in error by a taxpayer because of an error in the tax notice sent to the taxpayer, refund must be made directly by the tax collector and does not require approval from the department. At the request of the taxpayer, the amount paid in error may be applied by the tax collector to the taxes for which the taxpayer is liable. (e) Claims for refunds must be made pursuant to the rules of the department. A refund may not be granted unless a claim for the refund is made within 4 years after January 1 of the tax year for which the taxes were paid. (f) Upon receipt of the department’s written denial of a refund, the tax collector shall issue the denial in writing to the taxpayer. (g) If funds are available from current receipts subject to subsection (3) and a refund is approved, the taxpayer shall receive a refund within 100 days after a claim for refund is made, unless the tax collector, property appraiser, or department states good cause for remitting the refund after that date. The time periods stated in this paragraph and paragraphs (i) through (l) are directory and may be extended by a maximum of an additional 60 days if good cause is stated. (h) If the taxpayer contacts the property appraiser first, the property appraiser shall refer the taxpayer to the tax collector. (i) If a correction to the roll by the property appraiser is required as a condition for the refund, the tax collector shall, within 30 days, advise the property appraiser of the taxpayer’s application for a refund and forward the application to the property appraiser. (j) The property appraiser has 30 days after receipt of the form from the tax collector to correct the roll if a correction is permissible by law. Within the 30-day period, the property appraiser shall advise the tax collector in writing of whether the roll has been corrected and state the reasons why the roll was corrected or not corrected. (k) If the refund requires an order from the department, the tax collector shall forward the claim for refund to the department upon receipt of the correction from the property appraiser or 30 days after the claim for refund, whichever occurs first. This provision does not apply to corrections resulting in refunds of less than $2,500, which the tax collector shall make directly without order from the department from undistributed funds without approval of the various taxing authorities. (l) The department shall approve or deny a claim for a refund within 30 days after receiving the claim from the tax collector, unless good cause is stated for delaying the approval or denial beyond that date. (m) Subject to and after meeting the requirements of s. 194.171 and this section, an action to contest a denial of refund must be brought within 60 days after the date the tax collector sends the denial to the taxpayer. The tax collector may send notice of the denial electronically or by postal mail. Electronic transmission may be used only with the express consent of the property owner. If the notice of denial is sent electronically and is returned as undeliverable, a second notice must be sent. However, the original electronic transmission is the official mailing for the purpose of this section. (n) In computing any time period under this section, if the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period is extended to the next working day. (2) If the department orders a refund, the department shall forward a copy of its order to the tax collector who shall determine the pro rata share due by each taxing authority. The tax collector shall make the refund from undistributed funds held for that taxing authority and shall identify such refund as a reduction in the next distribution. If the undistributed funds are not sufficient for the refund, the tax collector shall notify the taxing authority of the shortfall. The taxing authority shall: (a) Authorize the tax collector to make refund and forward to the tax collector its pro rata share of the refund from currently budgeted funds, if available; or (b) Notify the tax collector that the taxing authority does not have funds currently available and provide for the payment of the refund in its budget for the next year. (3) A refund ordered by the department pursuant to this section shall be made by the tax collector in one aggregate amount composed of all the pro rata shares of the several taxing authorities concerned, except that a partial refund is allowed if one or more of the taxing authorities concerned do not have funds currently available to pay their pro rata shares of the refund and this would cause an unreasonable delay in the total refund. A statement by the tax collector explaining the refund shall accompany the refund payment. If taxes become delinquent as a result of a refund pursuant to subparagraph (1)(a)5. or paragraph (1)(d), the tax collector shall notify the property owner that the taxes have become delinquent and that a tax certificate will be sold if the taxes are not paid within 30 days after the date of delinquency. (4) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize any taxing authority to make any tax levy in excess of the maximum authorized by the constitution or the laws of this state.

      "text": "197.222 Prepayment of estimated tax by installment method.— (1) Taxes collected pursuant to this chapter may be prepaid in installments as provided in this section. A taxpayer may elect to prepay by installments for each tax notice for taxes estimated to be more than $100. A taxpayer who elects to prepay shall make payments based upon an estimated tax equal to the actual taxes levied upon the subject property in the prior year. In order to prepay by installments, the taxpayer must complete and file an application for each tax notice with the tax collector on or before April 30 of the year in which the taxpayer elects to prepay the taxes. After submission of an initial application, a taxpayer is not required to submit additional annual applications as long as he or she continues to elect to prepay taxes in installments. However, if in any year the taxpayer does not so elect, reapplication is required for a subsequent election. Installment payments shall be made according to the following schedule: (a) The first payment of one-quarter of the total amount of estimated taxes due must be made by June 30 of the year in which the taxes are assessed. A 6 percent discount applied against the amount of the installment shall be granted for such payment. The tax collector shall accept a late payment of the first installment through July 31. (b) The second payment of one-quarter of the total amount of estimated taxes must be made by September 30 of the year in which the taxes are assessed. A 4.5 percent discount applied against the amount of the installment shall be granted for such payment. (c) The third payment of one-quarter of the total amount of estimated taxes due, plus one-half of any adjustment made pursuant to a determination of actual tax liability, must be made by December 31 of the year in which taxes are assessed. A 3 percent discount applied against the amount of the installment shall be granted for such payment. (d) The fourth payment of one-quarter of the total amount of estimated taxes due, plus one-half of any adjustment made pursuant to a determination of actual tax liability, must be made by March 31 following the year in which taxes are assessed. A discount may not be granted for such payment. (e) If an installment due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date for the installment is the next working day, if the installment payment is delivered to a designated collection office of the tax collector. Taxpayers making such payment shall be entitled to the applicable discount rate authorized in this section. (2) A taxpayer must pay the first installment payment as required in paragraph (1)(a) in order to participate in the installment payment plan. If the taxpayer fails to do so, he or she will not be allowed to participate in the installment payment plan for that year, and subsequent participation will require reapplication as specified in subsection (1). Once a taxpayer elects to participate by timely paying the first payment, he or she is required to continue participation for the tax year in which the payment was first made and is not entitled to the discounts provided in s. 197.162. In the event a taxpayer fails to timely make an installment payment subsequent to the first payment, such taxpayer shall be required to remit with his or her next installment payment an amount equal to the current installment amount plus any installment amount due but unpaid. Delinquent payments shall be computed without allowance for any discount. Any amounts which remain unpaid as of the date of delinquency established for regular tax payments under s. 197.333 shall be subject to all the provisions of law applicable to delinquent taxes. (3) Upon receiving a taxpayer’s application for participation in the prepayment installment plan, and for those taxpayers who participated in the prepayment installment plan the previous year and who are not required to reapply, the tax collector shall send a quarterly tax notice with the discount rates provided in this section according to the payment schedule provided by the department. The postage or cost of electronic mailing shall be paid out of the general fund of the county, upon statement of the costs by the tax collector. (4) The moneys collected under this section shall be placed in an interest-earning escrow account. The taxes and penalties collected shall be distributed as provided in s. 197.383. The interest earned on this account shall be distributed as provided in s. 197.383 or, at the option of the tax collector, as provided in s. 219.075(2). (5) Notice of the right to prepay taxes pursuant to this section shall be provided with the notice of taxes. The notice shall inform the taxpayer of the right to prepay taxes in installments, that application forms can be obtained from the tax collector, and that reapplication is not necessary if the taxpayer participated in the prepayment installment plan for the previous year. The application forms shall be provided by the tax collector to those taxpayers requesting an application.

It is the legislative intent that all taxpayers shall be afforded the opportunity to pay estimated taxes pursuant to this section. (2) When it appears that it will be impossible for the property appraiser to certify the tax roll for collection in time sufficient to allow payment of current taxes prior to January 1, the property appraiser shall certify such circumstances in writing to the tax collector on or before December 1 and shall provide to the collector a true copy of the preceding year’s tax roll as certified for collection and a statement of current year’s millages from taxing authorities which have so certified. The property appraiser’s certification shall constitute authority for the collector to receive payments of estimated taxes. (3) Immediately upon receipt of the property appraiser’s certification under subsection (2), the tax collector shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county that the tax roll will not be certified for collection before January 1 and that payments of estimated taxes may be made by taxpayers who submit payment to the collector on or before December 31. (4) The tax collector shall accept payment of estimated current taxes based upon an amount equal to the taxes levied against the parcel in the previous year or an amount the tax collector deems to be a more accurate representation of the taxpayer’s current tax liability. (5) When estimated taxes are paid, the collector shall issue a validated temporary tax notice-receipt. Estimated taxes collected pursuant to this section shall be accounted for, deposited, and distributed as provided generally for ad valorem taxes. However, no distribution shall be made of estimated taxes collected until receipt of a tax roll properly certified for collection, except upon request for an emergency distribution made by the governing body of a taxing authority, certifying a lack of funds for current operations. (6) Discounts shall not be allowed on payments of estimated taxes, but shall be allowed on the amount of total taxes levied, determined at the time the tax roll has been certified for collection and final tax notice-receipts are issued. (7) Interest earned on payments of estimated taxes prior to certification of the tax roll for collection shall be retained by the tax collector’s office and disbursed as follows: (a) First, to pay the expenses of the tax collector’s office in administering and accounting for payments of estimated taxes; (b) Second, any excess remaining shall be distributed pro rata to the taxing authorities in the proportion that each authority’s tax levy for the prior tax year bears to the total ad valorem tax levy for the prior tax year; however, a taxing authority which has requested and received an emergency distribution of estimated taxes shall not receive this distribution. (8) Upon receipt of the tax roll certified for collection, the tax collector shall prepare a tax notice-receipt for each taxpayer who has made payment of estimated taxes, showing the amount of estimated taxes paid and the taxes remaining unpaid or any overpayment. Each such tax notice-receipt shall show the periods in which discounts are authorized, the amount of discount, and the discount applied to the estimated taxes with the appropriate remainder due. (9) After the discount has been applied to the estimated taxes paid and it is determined that an underpayment or overpayment occurred: (a) If the amount of underpayment is $10 or less, no additional billing is required except as determined by the tax collector. (b) If the amount of overpayment is more than $10, the tax collector shall immediately refund to the person who paid the estimated tax the amount of overpayment. Department approval is not required for the refund. (10) Any remaining unpaid taxes which become delinquent after notice by the tax collector shall be collected as are other delinquent taxes pursuant to this chapter. (11) Payment of estimated taxes shall not preclude the right of the taxpayer to challenge his or her assessment as provided in chapter 194.

Any applicant who is entitled to receive the homestead tax exemption but has waived it for any reason shall furnish a certificate of eligibility to receive the exemption. Such certificate shall be prepared by the county property appraiser upon request of the taxpayer. (2)(a) Approval of an application for homestead tax deferral shall defer the combined total of ad valorem taxes and non-ad valorem assessments: 1. Which exceeds 5 percent of the applicant’s household income for the prior calendar year if the applicant is younger than 65 years old; 2. Which exceeds 3 percent of the applicant’s household income for the prior calendar year if the applicant is 65 years old or older; or 3. In its entirety if the applicant’s household income: a. For the previous calendar year is less than $10,000; or b. Is less than the designated amount for the additional homestead exemption under s. 196.075 and the applicant is 65 years old or older. (b) The household income of an applicant who applies for a tax deferral before the end of the calendar year in which the taxes and non-ad valorem assessments are assessed shall be for the current year, adjusted to reflect estimated income for the full calendar year period. The estimate of a full year’s household income shall be made by multiplying the household income received to the date of application by a fraction, the numerator being 365 and the denominator being the number of days expired in the calendar year to the date of application. (3) The property appraiser shall promptly notify the tax collector if there is a change in ownership or the homestead exemption has been denied on property that has been granted a tax deferral.

Payment is delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year in which the change in use or failure to maintain insurance occurs. However, if the change in ownership is to a surviving spouse and the spouse is eligible to maintain the tax deferral on such property, the surviving spouse may continue the deferment of previously deferred taxes and interest pursuant to this chapter. (2) Whenever the property appraiser discovers that there has been a change in the ownership or use of property that has been granted a tax deferral, the property appraiser shall notify the tax collector in writing of the date such change occurs, and the tax collector shall collect any taxes, assessments, and interest due. (3) During any year in which the total amount of deferred taxes, interest, assessments, and all other unsatisfied liens on the homestead exceeds 85 percent of the just value of the homestead, the tax collector shall notify the owner that the portion of taxes, interest, and assessments which exceeds 85 percent of the just value of the homestead is due and payable within 30 days after the notice is sent. Failure to pay the amount due causes the total amount of deferred taxes, interest, and assessments to become delinquent. (4) Each year, upon notification, each owner of property on which taxes, interest, and assessments have been deferred shall submit to the tax collector a list of, and the current value of, all outstanding liens on the owner’s homestead. Failure to respond to this notification within 30 days causes the total amount of deferred taxes, interest, and assessments to become payable within 30 days.

In exercising their powers to contract, the tax collector may perform such duties by use of contracted services or products or by electronic means.

The tax collector may collect the cost of contracted services and reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs in actions on proceedings to recover delinquent taxes, interest, and costs. (2) A county tax collector may establish one or more branch offices by acquiring title to real property or by lease agreement. The tax collector may hire staff and equip such branch offices to conduct state business, or, if authorized to do so by resolution of the county governing body, conduct county business pursuant to s. 1(k), Art. VIII of the State Constitution. The department shall rely on the tax collector’s determination that a branch office is necessary and shall base its approval of the tax collector’s budget in accordance with the procedures of s. 195.087(2).

      "text": "197.4155 Delinquent personal property taxes; payment program.— (1) A county tax collector may implement a payment program for the payment of delinquent personal property taxes. If implemented, the tax collector shall require each taxpayer who requests to participate in the program to submit an application on a form prescribed by the tax collector which, at a minimum, must include the name, address, a description of the property subject to personal property taxes, and the amount of the personal property taxes owed by the taxpayer. (2) Within 10 days after a taxpayer who owes delinquent personal property taxes submits the required application, the tax collector may prescribe a payment plan for the full payment of the delinquent taxes, including any delinquency charges, interest, and costs allowed by this chapter. The plan must be in writing and must be delivered to the taxpayer after it is prescribed. When the plan is developed, the tax collector may consider a taxpayer’s current and anticipated future ability to pay over the time period of a potential payment plan. The plan must provide that if the taxpayer does not follow the payment terms or fails to timely file returns or pay current obligations after the date of the payment plan, the taxpayer is delinquent, and any unpaid balance of tax, penalty, or interest scheduled in the payment plan will be due and payable immediately. The plan must also provide that unpaid tax amounts bear interest as provided by law. In prescribing a payment plan, the tax collector may exercise flexibility as to the dates, amounts, and number of payments required to collect all delinquent personal property taxes owed, except that the plan must provide for the full satisfaction of all amounts owed by the taxpayer within 3 years after the due date of the first payment under the plan. (3) If a tax warrant is issued under s. 197.413 against a delinquent taxpayer who is participating in an installment payment plan under this section, the tax warrant is unenforceable as long as the taxpayer is neither delinquent under the terms of the installment payment plan nor attempting to remove or dispose of the personal property that is subject to the tax warrant. (4) If the amounts due under the installment payment plan are not paid in full in accordance with the terms of the plan, the tax collector may use all enforcement methods available under the law.

The notice shall be posted in at least two public places in the county and the property shall be sold at public auction at the location noted in the advertisement. Notice posted on the Internet qualifies as one location. The property sold shall be present if practical. If the sale is conducted electronically, a description of the property and a photograph, when practical, shall be available. At any time before the sale the owner or claimant of the property may release the property by the payment of the taxes, plus delinquent charges, interest, and costs, for which the property was liable to be sold. In case such a sale is made, the tax collector is entitled to the same fees and charges as are allowed sheriffs upon execution sales. (2) If the property levied upon is sold for more than the amount of taxes, delinquent charges, interest, costs, and collection fees, the surplus shall be returned to the person who had possession of the property when the levy was made or to the owner of the property. (3) If the property levied upon cannot be located in the county or is sold for less than the amount of taxes, delinquent charges, interest, costs, and collection fees, the deficit shall be a general lien against all the taxpayer’s other personal property situated in the county. The other property may be seized and sold in the same manner as property on which there is a specific lien for delinquent taxes. History.—s. 173, ch. 85-342; s. 38, ch. 2011-151.

      "text": "197.432 Sale of tax certificates for unpaid taxes.— (1) On the day and approximately at the time designated in the notice of the sale, the tax collector shall commence the sale of tax certificates on the real property on which taxes have not been paid. The tax collector shall continue the sale from day to day until each certificate is sold to pay the taxes, interest, costs, and charges on the parcel described in the certificate. The tax collector shall offer all certificates on the property as they are listed on the tax roll. The tax collector may conduct the sale of tax certificates for unpaid taxes pursuant to this section by electronic means, which may allow for proxy bidding. Such electronic means must comply with the procedures provided in this chapter. A tax collector who chooses to conduct such electronic sales may receive electronic deposits and payments related to the tax certificate sale. (2) A lien created through the sale of a tax certificate may not be enforced in any manner except as prescribed in this chapter. (3) If the taxes on a real property and all interest, costs, and charges are paid before a tax certificate is awarded to a buyer or struck to the county, the tax collector may not issue the tax certificate. After a tax certificate is awarded to a buyer or struck to the county, the delinquent taxes, interest, costs, and charges are paid by the redemption of the tax certificate. (4) A tax certificate representing less than $250 in delinquent taxes on property that has been granted a homestead exemption for the year in which the delinquent taxes were assessed may not be sold at public auction or by electronic sale as provided in subsection (1) but must be issued by the tax collector to the county at the maximum rate of interest allowed. Section 197.4725 or s. 197.502(3) may not be invoked if the homestead exemption is granted to the person who received the homestead exemption for the year in which the tax certificate was issued unless any such tax certificates and accrued interest represent an amount of $250 or more. (5) A tax certificate that has not been sold on property for which a tax deed application is pending shall be struck to the county. (6) Each certificate shall be awarded to the person who will pay the taxes, interest, costs, and charges and will demand the lowest rate of interest, not in excess of the maximum rate of interest allowed by this chapter. The tax collector shall accept bids in even increments and in fractional interest rate bids of one-quarter of 1 percent only. If multiple bidders offer the same lowest rate of interest, the tax collector shall determine the method of selecting the bidder to whom the certificate will be awarded. Acceptable methods include the bid received first or use of a random-number generator. If a certificate is not purchased, the certificate shall be struck to the county at the maximum rate of interest allowed by this chapter. (7) The tax collector may require payment of a reasonable deposit from any person who wishes to bid for a tax certificate. A person who fails or refuses to pay any bid made by, or on behalf of, such person is not entitled to bid or have any other bid accepted or enforced except as authorized by the tax collector. The tax collector shall provide written or electronic notice when certificates are ready for issuance. Payment must be made within 48 hours after the transmission of the electronic notice by the tax collector or mailing of such notice or, at the tax collector’s discretion, all or a portion of the deposit placed by the bidder may be forfeited. Payment must be made before the issuance of the certificate by the tax collector. If the tax collector determines that payment has been requested in error, the tax collector shall issue a refund within 15 business days after such payment. (8) Upon the cancellation of a bid: (a) If the sale has not been adjourned, the tax collector shall reoffer the certificate for sale. (b) If the sale has been adjourned, the tax collector shall reoffer the certificate at a subsequent sale. Before the subsequent sale, the parcels must be readvertised pursuant to s. 197.402(3). (9) The tax collector shall maintain records of all the certificates sold for taxes, showing the date of the sale, the number of each certificate, the name of the owner as returned, a description of the property within the certificate, the name of the purchaser, the interest rate bid, and the amount for which sale was made. Such records may be maintained electronically and shall be cited as the “list of tax certificates sold.” (10) A certificate may not be sold on, and a lien is not created in, property owned by any governmental unit which has become subject to taxation due to lease of the property to a nongovernmental lessee. The delinquent taxes shall be enforced and collected in the manner provided in s. 196.199(8). However, the ad valorem real property taxes levied on a leasehold that is taxed as real property under s. 196.199(2)(b), and for which no rental payments are due under the agreement that created the leasehold or for which payments required under the original leasehold agreement have been waived or prohibited by law before January 1, 1993, must be paid by the lessee. If the taxes are unpaid, the delinquent taxes become a lien on the leasehold and may be collected and enforced under this chapter. (11) Any tax certificates that are void due to an error of the property appraiser, the tax collector, or the taxing or levying authority and are subsequently canceled, or are corrected or amended pursuant to this chapter or chapter 196, earn interest at the rate of 8 percent per year, simple interest, or the rate of interest bid at the tax certificate sale, whichever is less, calculated monthly from the date the certificate was purchased until the date the tax collector issues the refund. Refunds made on tax certificates that are corrected or void shall be processed pursuant to the procedure set forth in s. 197.182, except that the 4-year time period provided for in s. 197.182(1)(e) does not apply to or bar refunds resulting from correction or cancellation of certificates and release of tax deeds as authorized herein. (12) The tax collector is entitled to a commission of 5 percent on the amount of the delinquent taxes and interest when a tax certificate is sold. The commission must be included in the face value of the certificate. However, the tax collector is not entitled to a commission for a certificate that is struck to the county until the certificate is redeemed or purchased. If a tax deed is issued to the county, the tax collector may not receive his or her commission until the property is sold and conveyed by the county. (13) The holder of a tax certificate may not directly, through an agent, or otherwise initiate contact with the owner of property upon which he or she holds a tax certificate to encourage or demand payment until 2 years after April 1 of the year of issuance of the tax certificate. (14) Any holder of a tax certificate who, prior to the date 2 years after April 1 of the year of issuance of the tax certificate, initiates, or whose agent initiates, contact with the property owner upon which he or she holds a certificate encouraging or demanding payment may be barred by the tax collector from bidding at a tax certificate sale. Unfair or deceptive contact by the holder of a tax certificate to a property owner to obtain payment is an unfair and deceptive trade practice, as referenced in s. 501.204(1), regardless of whether the tax certificate is redeemed. Such unfair or deceptive contact is actionable under ss. 501.2075-501.211. If the property owner later redeems the certificate in reliance on the deceptive or unfair practice, the unfair or deceptive contact is actionable under applicable laws prohibiting fraud.

The plaintiff may include as many void certificates as desired, whether they cover the same land or different parcels of land. (3) If the court finds for the plaintiff, it shall enter a final judgment declaring the tax certificate void, canceling it of record, and ordering each governmental unit or agency receiving any sums for the tax certificate to return the amounts received by it to the plaintiff, and, thereupon, the amount received for the certificate by the governmental units or agencies shall be returned. (4) The provisions of this section may also be used by the holder of any tax certificate who pays, redeems, or causes to be canceled and surrenders any other tax certificate in connection with an application for tax deed or in connection with tax foreclosure proceedings, if the other tax certificate is void for any reason.

This subsection applies to all county-held tax certificates and all individual tax certificates except those with an interest rate bid of zero percent. (3) The tax collector shall receive a fee of $6.25 for each tax certificate redeemed. (4) A portion of a certificate may be redeemed only if such portion can be ascertained by legal description and the portion to be redeemed is evidenced by a contract for sale or recorded deed. The tax collector shall make a written request for apportionment to the property appraiser, and within 15 days the property appraiser shall furnish the tax collector a certificate apportioning the value to that portion sought to be redeemed and to the remaining land covered by the certificate.

Such notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date of sale. If no address is listed in the tax collector’s statement, then no notice shall be required. (b) The clerk shall enclose with every copy mailed a statement as follows: WARNING: There are unpaid taxes on property which you own or in which you have a legal interest. The property will be sold at public auction on (date) unless the back taxes are paid. To make payment, or to receive further information, contact the clerk of court immediately at (address) , (telephone number) . (c) The clerk shall complete and attach to the affidavit of the publisher a certificate containing the names and addresses of those persons notified and the date the notice was mailed. The certificate shall be signed by the clerk and the clerk’s official seal affixed. The certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that the notice was mailed. If no address is listed on the tax collector’s certification, the clerk shall execute a certificate to that effect. (d) The failure of anyone to receive notice as provided herein shall not affect the validity of the tax deed issued pursuant to the notice. (e) A printed copy of the notice as published in the newspaper, accompanied by the warning statement described in paragraph (b), shall be deemed sufficient notice. (2)(a) In addition to the notice provided in subsection (1), the sheriff of the county in which the legal titleholder resides shall, at least 20 days prior to the date of sale, notify the legal titleholder of record of the property on which the tax certificate is outstanding. The original notice and sufficient copies shall be prepared by the clerk and provided to the sheriff. Such notice shall be served as specified in chapter 48; if the sheriff is unable to make service, he or she shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place at the legal titleholder’s last known address. The inability of the sheriff to serve notice on the legal titleholder shall not affect the validity of the tax deed issued pursuant to the notice. A legal titleholder of record who resides outside the state may be notified by the clerk as provided in subsection (1). The notice shall be in substantially the following form: WARNING There are unpaid taxes on the property which you own. The property will be sold at public auction on (date) unless the back taxes are paid. To make arrangements for payment, or to receive further information, contact the clerk of court at (address) , (telephone number) . In addition, if the legal titleholder does not reside in the county in which the property to be sold is located, a copy of such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property by the sheriff of the county in which the property is located. However, no posting of notice shall be required if the property to be sold is classified for assessment purposes, according to use classifications established by the department, as nonagricultural acreage or vacant land. (b) In addition to the notice provided in subsection (1), the clerk shall notify by certified mail with return receipt requested, or by registered mail if the notice is to be sent outside the continental United States, the persons listed in the tax collector’s statement pursuant to s. 197.502(4)(h) that application for a tax deed has been made. Such notice shall be mailed at least 20 days prior to the date of sale. If no address is listed in the tax collector’s statement, then no notice shall be required. Enclosed with the copy of the notice shall be a statement in substantially the following form: WARNING There are unpaid taxes on property contiguous to your property. The property with the unpaid taxes will be sold at auction on (date) unless the back taxes are paid. To make payment, or to receive further information about the purchase of the property, contact the clerk of court immediately at (address) , (telephone number) . Neither the failure of the tax collector to include the list of contiguous property owners pursuant to s. 197.502(4)(h) in his or her statement to the clerk nor the failure of the clerk to mail this notice to any or all of the persons listed in the tax collector’s statement pursuant to s. 197.502(4)(h) shall be a basis to challenge the validity of the tax deed issued pursuant to any notice under this section. (3) When sending or serving a notice under this section, the clerk of the circuit court may rely on the addresses provided by the tax collector based on the certified tax roll and property information reports. The clerk of the circuit court has no duty to seek further information as to the validity of such addresses, because property owners are presumed to know that taxes are due and payable annually under s. 197.122. (4) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the tax collector, or any other public official, in his or her discretion from giving additional notice in any form concerning tax certificates and tax sales beyond the minimum requirements of this chapter.

The amount required to redeem the tax certificate, plus the amounts paid by the holder to the clerk in charges for costs of sale, redemption of other tax certificates on the same property, and all other costs to the applicant for tax deed, plus interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per month for the period running from the month after the date of application for the deed through the month of sale and costs incurred for the service of notice provided for in s. 197.522(2), shall be the bid of the certificateholder for the property. If tax certificates exist or if delinquent taxes accrued subsequent to the filing of the tax deed application, the amount required to redeem such tax certificates or pay such delinquent taxes must be included in the minimum bid. However, if the land to be sold is assessed on the latest tax roll as homestead property, the bid of the certificateholder must be increased to include an amount equal to one-half of the assessed value of the homestead property as required by s. 197.502. If there are no higher bids, the property shall be struck off and sold to the certificateholder, who shall pay to the clerk any amounts included in the minimum bid not already paid, including, but not limited to, the documentary stamp tax, the recording fees, and, if the property is homestead property, the moneys to cover the one-half value of the homestead within 30 days after the sale. Upon payment, a tax deed shall be issued and recorded by the clerk. If the certificateholder fails to make full payment when due, the clerk shall enter the land on a list entitled “lands available for taxes.” (2) The certificateholder has the right to bid as others present may bid, and the property shall be struck off and sold to the highest bidder. The high bidder shall post with the clerk a nonrefundable deposit of 5 percent of the bid or $200, whichever is greater, at the time of the sale, to be applied to the sale price at the time of full payment. Notice of the deposit requirement must be posted at the auction site, and the clerk may require bidders to show their willingness and ability to post the deposit. If full payment of the final bid and of documentary stamp tax and recording fees is not made within 24 hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, the clerk shall cancel all bids, readvertise the sale as provided in this section, and pay all costs of the sale from the deposit. Any remaining funds must be applied toward the opening bid. The clerk may refuse to recognize the bid of any person who has previously bid and refused, for any reason, to honor such bid. (3) If the sale is canceled for any reason or the buyer fails to make full payment within the time required, the clerk shall readvertise the sale within 30 days after the buyer’s nonpayment or, if canceled, within 30 days after the clerk receives the costs of resale. The sale shall be held within 30 days after readvertising. Only one advertisement is necessary. The amount of the opening bid shall be increased by the cost of advertising, additional clerk’s fees as provided for in s. 28.24(22), and interest as provided for in subsection (1). If, at the subsequent sale, there are no bidders at the tax deed sale and the certificateholder fails to pay the moneys due within 30 days after the sale, the clerk may not readvertise the sale and shall place the property on a list entitled “lands available for taxes.” The clerk must receive full payment before the issuance of the tax deed. (4)(a) A clerk may conduct electronic tax deed sales in lieu of public outcry. The clerk must comply with the procedures provided in this chapter, except that electronic proxy bidding shall be allowed and the clerk may require bidders to advance sufficient funds to pay the deposit required by subsection (2). The clerk shall provide access to the electronic sale by computer terminals open to the public at a designated location. A clerk who conducts such electronic sales may receive electronic deposits and payments related to the sale. The portion of an advance deposit from a winning bidder required by subsection (2) shall, upon acceptance of the winning bid, be subject to the fee under s. 28.24(11). (b) This subsection does not restrict or limit the authority of a charter county to conduct electronic tax deed sales. In a charter county where the clerk of the circuit court does not conduct all electronic sales, the charter county shall be permitted to receive electronic deposits and payments related to sales it conducts, as well as to subject the winning bidder to a fee, consistent with the schedule in s. 28.24(11). (c) The costs of electronic tax deed sales shall be added to the charges for the costs of sale under subsection (1) and paid by the certificateholder when filing an application for a tax deed.

The clerk shall distribute the amount required to redeem the certificate or certificates and the amount required for the redemption of other tax certificates on the same land with omitted taxes and with all costs, plus interest thereon at the rate of 1.5 percent per month for the period running from the month after the date of application for the deed through the month of sale, in the same manner as he or she distributes money received for the redemption of tax certificates owned by the county. (2)(a) If the property is purchased for an amount in excess of the statutory bid of the certificateholder, the surplus must be paid over and disbursed by the clerk as set forth in subsections (3), (5), and (6). If the opening bid included the homestead assessment pursuant to s. 197.502(6)(c), that amount must be treated as surplus and distributed in the same manner. The clerk shall distribute the surplus to the governmental units for the payment of any lien of record held by a governmental unit against the property, including any tax certificates not incorporated in the tax deed application and omitted taxes, if any. If there remains a balance of undistributed funds, the balance must be retained by the clerk for the benefit of persons described in s. 197.522(1)(a), except those persons described in s. 197.502(4)(h), as their interests may appear. The clerk shall mail notices to such persons notifying them of the funds held for their benefit at the addresses provided in s. 197.502(4). Such notice constitutes compliance with the requirements of s. 717.117(6). Any service charges and costs of mailing notices shall be paid out of the excess balance held by the clerk. Notice must be provided in substantially the following form: NOTICE OF SURPLUS FUNDS FROM TAX DEED SALE CLERK OF COURT COUNTY, FLORIDA Tax Deed # Certificate # Property Description: Pursuant to chapter 197, Florida Statutes, the above property was sold at public sale on (date of sale) , and a surplus of $ (amount) (subject to change) will be held by this office for 120 days beginning on the date of this notice to benefit the persons having an interest in this property as described in section 197.502(4), Florida Statutes, as their interests may appear (except for those persons described in section 197.502(4)(h), Florida Statutes). To the extent possible, these funds will be used to satisfy in full each claimant with a senior mortgage or lien in the property before distribution of any funds to any junior mortgage or lien claimant or to the former property owner. To be considered for funds when they are distributed, you must file a notarized statement of claim with this office within 120 days of this notice. If you are a lienholder, your claim must include the particulars of your lien and the amounts currently due. Any lienholder claim that is not filed within the 120-day deadline is barred. A copy of this notice must be attached to your statement of claim. After the office examines the filed claim statements, it will notify you if you are entitled to any payment. Dated: Clerk of Court (b) The mailed notice must include a form for making a claim under subsection (3). Service charges at the rate set forth in s. 28.24(11) and the costs of mailing must be paid out of the surplus funds held by the clerk. If the clerk or comptroller certifies that the surplus funds are not sufficient to cover the service charges and mailing costs, the clerk shall receive the total amount of surplus funds as a service charge. For purposes of identifying unclaimed property pursuant to s. 717.113, excess proceeds shall be presumed payable or distributable on the date the notice is sent. (3) A person receiving the notice under subsection (2) has 120 days from the date of the notice to file a written claim with the clerk for the surplus proceeds. A claim in substantially the following form is deemed sufficient: CLAIM TO RECEIVE SURPLUS PROCEEDS OF A TAX DEED SALE Complete and return to: By mail: By e-mail: Note: The Clerk of the Court must pay all valid liens before distributing surplus funds to a titleholder. Claimant’s name: Contact name, if applicable: Address: Telephone Number: E-mail Address: Tax No.: Date of sale (if known): I am not making a claim and waive any claim I might have to the surplus funds on this tax deed sale. I claim surplus proceeds resulting from the above tax deed sale. I am a (check one): ☐Lienholder; ☐Titleholder. (1) LIENHOLDER INFORMATION (Complete if claim is based on a lien against the sold property). (a) Type of Lien: Mortgage; Court Judgment; Other Describe in detail: If your lien is recorded in the county’s official records, list the following, if known: Recording date: ; Instrument #: ; Book #: ; Page #: . (b) Original amount of lien: $ (c) Amounts due: $ 1. Principal remaining due: $ 2. Interest due: $ 3. Fees and costs due, including late fees: $ (describe costs in detail, include additional sheet if needed). 4. Attorney fees: $ (provide amount claimed): $ (2) TITLEHOLDER INFORMATION (Complete if claim is based on title formerly held on sold property.) (a) Nature of title (check one): ☐Deed; ☐Court Judgment; ☐Other (describe in detail) . (b) If your former title is recorded in the county’s official records, list the following, if known: Recording date: ; Instrument #: ; Book #: ; Page #: . (c) Amount of surplus tax deed sale proceeds claimed: $ (d) Does the titleholder claim the subject property was homestead property? Yes No. (3) I hereby swear or affirm that all of the above information is true and correct. Date: Signature: STATE OF FLORIDA COUNTY Sworn to or affirmed and signed before me on (date) by (name of affiant) . NOTARY PUBLIC or DEPUTY CLERK (Print, Type, or Stamp Commissioned Name of Notary) Personally Known, or Produced Identification: Identification Produced: (4) A claim may be: (a) Mailed using the United States Postal Service. The filing date is the postmark on the mailed claim; (b) Delivered using either a commercial delivery service or in person. The filing date is the day of delivery; or (c) Sent by fax or e-mail, as authorized by the clerk. The filing date is the date the clerk receives the fax or e-mail. (5) Except for claims by a property owner, claims that are not filed on or before close of business on the 120th day after the date of the mailed notice as required by subsection (2), are barred. A person, other than the property owner, who fails to file a proper and timely claim is barred from receiving any disbursement of the surplus funds. The failure of any person described in s. 197.502(4), other than the property owner, to file a claim for surplus funds within the 120 days constitutes a waiver of interest in the surplus funds, and all claims thereto are forever barred. (6) Within 90 days after the claim period expires, the clerk may either file an interpleader action in circuit court, if potentially conflicting claims to the funds exist, or pay the surplus funds according to the clerk’s determination of the priority of claims using the information provided by the claimants under subsection (3). Fees and costs incurred by the clerk in determining whether an interpleader action should be filed shall be paid from the surplus funds. If the clerk files an interpleader action, the court shall determine the distribution of funds based upon the priority of liens filed. The clerk may move the court to award reasonable fees and costs from the interpleaded funds. An action to require payment of surplus funds is not ripe until the claim and review periods expire. The failure of a person described in s. 197.502(4), other than the property owner, to file a claim for surplus funds within the 120 days constitutes a waiver of all interest in the surplus funds, and all claims for them are forever barred. (7) A holder of a recorded governmental lien, other than a federal government lien or ad valorem tax lien, must file a request for disbursement of surplus funds within 120 days after the mailing of the notice of surplus funds. The clerk or comptroller must disburse payments to each governmental unit to pay any lien of record held by a governmental unit against the property, including any tax certificate not incorporated in the tax deed application and any omitted taxes, before disbursing the surplus funds to nongovernmental claimants. (8) The tax deed recipient may directly pay off all liens to governmental units that could otherwise have been requested from surplus funds, and, upon filing a timely claim under subsection (3) with proof of payment, the tax deed recipient may receive the same amount of funds from the surplus funds for all amounts paid to each governmental unit in the same priority as the original lienholder. (9) If the clerk does not receive claims for surplus funds within the 120-day claim period, as required in subsection (5), there is a conclusive presumption that the legal titleholder of record described in s. 197.502(4)(a) is entitled to the surplus funds. The clerk must process the surplus funds in the manner provided in chapter 717, regardless of whether the legal titleholder is a resident of the state or not.
