(2) The complaint must contain the statement of facts and a notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (3) If no hearing is requested within the time allowed by ss. 120.569 and 120.57, or if a hearing is held and the office finds that any of the charges are true, the office may enter an order directing the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, or family trust company-affiliated party, or the individual named therein to cease and desist from engaging in the conduct complained of and to take corrective action. (4) If the family trust company, licensed family trust company, foreign licensed family trust company, or family trust company-affiliated party, or the individual named in such order, fails to respond to the complaint within the time allotted in ss. 120.569 and 120.57, such failure constitutes a default and justifies the entry of a cease and desist order. (5) A contested or default cease and desist order is effective when reduced to writing and served upon the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, or family trust company-affiliated party, or the individual named therein.

(6) If the office finds that conduct described in subsection (1) is likely to cause substantial prejudice to members, shareholders, or beneficiaries of fiduciary accounts of the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, or to beneficiaries of services rendered by such company, it may issue an emergency cease and desist order requiring the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, family trust company-affiliated party, or individual named therein to immediately cease and desist from engaging in the conduct complained of and to take corrective action. The emergency order is effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order upon the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, or family trust company-affiliated party and remains effective for 90 days. If the office begins nonemergency cease and desist proceedings under subsection (1), the emergency order remains effective until the conclusion of the proceedings under ss. 120.569 and 120.57.

      "text": "662.145 Grounds for removal.— (1) The office may issue and serve upon a licensed family trust company or a family trust company and a family trust company-affiliated party a complaint stating charges if the office has reason to believe that the family trust company-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged in conduct that: (a) Demonstrates that the company is not a family trust company as defined in this chapter; (b) Is a prohibited act or practice under s. 662.131; (c) Is a violation of s. 662.1225, s. 662.123(1)(a), s. 662.126, s. 662.127, s. 662.128, s. 662.130, or s. 662.134; (d) Is a violation of any other law involving fraud or moral turpitude which constitutes a felony; (e) Is a violation of chapter 896, relating to offenses related to financial transactions, or similar state or federal law; (f) Is a willful violation of a rule of the commission; (g) Is a willful violation of an order of the office; (h) Is a willful breach of a written agreement with the office; or (i) Is an act of commission or omission or a practice that the office has reason to believe is a breach of trust or fiduciary duty. (2) The complaint must contain a statement of facts and a notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57. (3) If no hearing is requested within the time allowed by ss. 120.569 and 120.57, or if a hearing is held and the office finds that any of the charges in the complaint are true, the office may enter an order removing the family trust company-affiliated party or restricting or prohibiting participation by the family trust company-affiliated party in the affairs of the family trust company, licensed family trust company, or state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation. (4) If the family trust company-affiliated party fails to respond to the complaint within the time allowed in ss. 120.569 and 120.57, such failure constitutes a default and justifies the entry of an order of removal. (5) A contested or default order of removal is effective when reduced to writing and served on the family trust company or licensed family trust company and the family trust company-affiliated party. An uncontested order of removal is effective as agreed. (6) The chief executive officer, or the person holding the equivalent office, of a family trust company or licensed family trust company shall promptly notify the office if he or she has actual knowledge that a family trust company-affiliated party is charged with a felony in a state or federal court. (a) If a family trust company-affiliated party is charged with a felony in a state or federal court, or is charged with an offense in a court of a foreign country with which the United States maintains diplomatic relations which involves a violation of law relating to fraud, currency transaction reporting, money laundering, theft, or moral turpitude and the charge is equivalent to a felony charge under state or federal law, the office may enter an emergency order suspending the family trust company-affiliated party or restricting or prohibiting participation by such party in the affairs of that particular family trust company or licensed family trust company or any state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation, upon service of the order upon the company and family trust company-affiliated party charged. (b) The order must contain notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57, at which the family trust company-affiliated party may request a postsuspension hearing to show that continued service to or participation in the affairs of the family trust company or licensed family trust company does not pose a threat to the interests of the company. In accordance with applicable commission rules, the office shall notify the family trust company-affiliated party whether the order suspending or prohibiting the company-affiliated party from participating in the affairs of a licensed family trust company or family trust company, or state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation will be rescinded or otherwise modified. The emergency order remains in effect, unless otherwise modified by the office, until the criminal charge is disposed of. The acquittal of the family trust company-affiliated party charged, or the final, unappealed dismissal of all charges against such person, dissolves the emergency order, but does not prohibit the office from instituting proceedings under subsection (1). If the family trust company-affiliated party charged is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of adjudication, the emergency order becomes final. (7) A family trust company-affiliated party removed from office pursuant to this section is not eligible for reelection to such position or to any official position in a family trust company, licensed family trust company, or financial institution in this state except with the written consent of the office. A family trust company-affiliated party who is removed, restricted, or prohibited from participation in the affairs of a family trust company, licensed family trust company, or state financial institution pursuant to this section may petition the office for modification or termination of such removal, restriction, or prohibition. (8) The resignation, termination of employment or participation, or separation from a family trust company or a licensed family trust company of the family trust company-affiliated party does not affect the jurisdiction and authority of the office to issue a notice and proceed under this section against the company-affiliated party if such notice is served before the end of the 6-year period beginning on the date such person ceases to be a family trust company-affiliated party with respect to such company.

Before the production of the books and records of a family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company, the party seeking production must reimburse the company for the reasonable costs and fees incurred in compliance with the production. If the parties disagree regarding the amount of reimbursement, the party seeking the records may request the court having jurisdiction to set the amount of reimbursement; (d) Pursuant to a subpoena, to any federal or state law enforcement or prosecutorial instrumentality authorized to investigate suspected criminal activity; (e) As authorized by the board of directors, if in corporate form, or the managers, if in limited liability company form; or (f) As provided in subsection (2). (2)(a) Each customer and stockholder, if a corporation, or member, if a limited liability company, has the right to inspect the books and records of a family trust company or licensed family trust company as they pertain to his or her accounts or the determination of his or her voting rights. (b) The books and records pertaining to customers, members, and stockholders of a family trust company or licensed family trust company shall be kept confidential by the company and its directors, managers, officers, and employees. The books and records of customers, members, and stockholders may not be released except upon the express authorization of the customer as to his or her own accounts or a stockholder or member regarding his or her voting rights. However, information may be released, without the authorization of a customer, member, or shareholder in a manner prescribed by the board of directors, if a corporation, or managers, if a limited liability company, to verify or corroborate the existence or amount of a customer’s account if that information is reasonably provided to meet the needs of commerce and to ensure accurate credit information. Notwithstanding this paragraph, this subsection does not prohibit a family trust company or licensed family trust company from disclosing financial information referenced in this subsection as permitted under 15 U.S.C. s. 6802, as amended. (c) A person who willfully violates a provision of this section which relates to unlawful disclosure of confidential information commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. (d) This subsection does not apply to a foreign licensed family trust company. The laws of the jurisdiction of its principal place of business govern the rights of customers, members, and stockholders to inspect its books and records. (3) For purposes of this section, the term “books and records” includes, but is not limited to, an application for a license and any documents connected with the application under s. 662.121; the office’s corresponding investigation under s. 662.1215 in granting or denying the issuance of the license; the initial registration documents of a family trust company or foreign licensed family trust company under s. 662.122; the annual renewal made by a family trust company, licensed family trust company, or foreign licensed family trust company under s. 662.128; and the documentation submitted to the office in connection with a licensed family trust company discontinuing its business under s. 662.129.
