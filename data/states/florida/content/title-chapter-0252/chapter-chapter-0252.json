      "text": "252.37 Financing.— (1) The Legislature intends and declares it to be the policy of the state that funds to meet emergencies shall always be available. (2)(a) It is the legislative intent that the first recourse be made to funds specifically appropriated to state and local agencies for disaster relief or response. (b) If the Governor finds that the demands placed upon these funds in coping with a particular disaster declared by the Governor as a state of emergency are unreasonably great, she or he may make funds available by transferring and expending moneys from the Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund created under s. 252.3711. The Governor may request that additional funds be transferred or appropriated to the Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund by a budget amendment, subject to approval of the Legislative Budget Commission. (c) Following the expiration or termination of the state of emergency, the Governor may transfer moneys with a budget amendment, subject to approval by the Legislative Budget Commission, to satisfy the budget authority granted for such emergency. The transfers and expenditures supporting the amendment must be directly related to the declared disaster or emergency. (3) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Governor to apply for, administer, and expend any grants, gifts, or payments in aid of emergency prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, or recovery. (4)(a) Whenever the Federal Government or any agency or officer thereof offers to the state or, through the state, to any political subdivision thereof services, equipment, supplies, materials, or funds by way of gift, grant, or loan for the purposes of emergency management, the state, acting through the division, or such political subdivision, acting with the consent of the Governor or the Governor’s authorized representative, may accept such offer. Upon such acceptance, the division or the presiding officer or governing body of such political subdivision may authorize receipt of the gift, grant, or loan on behalf of the state or such political subdivision, subject to the terms of the offer and the rules and regulations of the agency making the offer. (b) Whenever any person, firm, or corporation offers to the state or to any political subdivision thereof services, equipment, supplies, materials, or funds by way of gift, grant, loan, or other agreement for the purpose of emergency management, the state, acting through the division, or such political subdivision, acting through its governing body or a local emergency management agency, may accept such offer. Upon such acceptance, the division or the presiding officer or governing body of the political subdivision may authorize receipt of the gift, grant, or loan on behalf of the state or such political subdivision, subject to the terms of the offer. (5) Unless otherwise specified in the General Appropriations Act: (a) Whenever the state accepts financial assistance from the Federal Government or its agencies under the federal Public Assistance Program and such financial assistance is conditioned upon a requirement for matching funds, the state shall provide the entire match requirement for state agencies and one-half of the required match for grants to local governments. The affected local government shall be required to provide one-half of the required match prior to receipt of such financial assistance. (b) The Executive Office of the Governor may approve a waiver, subject to the requirement for legislative notice and review under s. 216.177, of all or a portion of the required match for public assistance projects for local governments if the Executive Office of the Governor determines that such a match requirement cannot be provided, or that doing so would impose a documented hardship on the local government, and if the local government applies for the waiver within the first 18 months after the disaster is declared. (c) If the division intends to accept or apply for federal funds for a division-administered program that is new, that will be implemented in a manner that is innovative or significantly different from the manner in which the program is typically administered, or that will require a state match for which the division will be required to seek new budget authority, the division must notify the Legislature of its intent to accept or apply for the federal funds. The notice must detail the federal program under which the funds will be accepted or applied for, the intended purpose and use of the funds, and the amount of funds, including the estimated state match. (d) Subject to appropriation, and notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Legislature intends to provide the entire match requirement for Public Assistance Program grants to local governments within a county designated in the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declarations for Hurricane Ian or Hurricane Nicole. Local governments named in such Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declarations must enter into agreements with the division to have their portions of the match requirements waived and must agree to use an equal amount of funds toward further disaster recovery or mitigation. Funds shall be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a local government in an agreement with the division under this paragraph is not required to provide one-half of the required match prior to receipt of Public Assistance Program financial assistance. The division shall report quarterly to the Executive Office of the Governor and the chair of each legislative appropriations committee on the amount of match requirements waived, agreements entered into with local governments, and the amount of remaining appropriated funds. This paragraph expires June 30, 2027. (e) Subject to appropriation, and notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Legislature intends to provide the entire match requirement for Public Assistance Program grants to local governments within a county designated for individual assistance and public assistance (categories A-G) in the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declaration for Hurricane Idalia. Such local governments must enter into agreements with the division to have their portions of the match requirements waived and must agree to use an equal amount of funds toward further disaster recovery or mitigation. Funds shall be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a local government in an agreement with the division under this paragraph is not required to provide one-half of the required match before it receives Public Assistance Program financial assistance. The division shall report quarterly to the Executive Office of the Governor and the chair of each legislative appropriations committee on the amount of match requirements waived, agreements entered into with local governments, and the amount of remaining appropriated funds. This paragraph expires June 30, 2028. (6) Whenever the state accepts financial assistance from the Federal Government or its agencies under the federal Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant Program and such financial assistance is conditioned upon a requirement for matching funds, the eligible subgrantee recipient shall be required to provide the full amount of the required match prior to receipt of such financial assistance unless otherwise specified in the General Appropriations Act. (7) The division shall take steps to maximize the availability and expedite the distribution of financial assistance from the Federal Government to state and local agencies. Such steps must include the standardization and streamlining of the application process for financial assistance through the federal Public Assistance Program and provision of assistance to applicants in order to mitigate the risk of noncompliance with federal program requirements. The division shall use federal funds allocated as management costs or other funds as appropriated to implement this subsection.

      "text": "252.85 Fees.— (1) Any owner or operator of a facility required under s. 302 or s. 312 of EPCRA, or by s. 252.87, to submit a notification or an annual inventory form to the commission shall be required to pay an annual registration fee. The fee for any company, including all facilities under common ownership or control, shall not be less than $25 nor more than $2,000. The division shall establish a reduced fee, of not less than $25 nor more than $500, applicable to any owner or operator regulated under part I of chapter 368, chapter 527, or s. 376.303, which does not have present any extremely hazardous substance, as defined by EPCRA, in excess of a threshold planning quantity, as established by EPCRA. The division shall establish a reduced fee of not less than $25 nor more than $1,000, applicable to any owner or operator of a facility with a Standard Industrial Classification Code of 01, 02, or 07, which is eligible for the “routine agricultural use” exemption provided in ss. 311 and 312 of EPCRA. The fee under this subsection shall be based on the number of employees employed within the state at facilities under the common ownership or control of such owner or operator, which number shall be determined, to the extent possible, in accordance with data supplied by the Department of Commerce or its tax collection service provider. In order to avoid the duplicative reporting of seasonal and temporary agricultural employees, fees applicable to owners or operators of agricultural facilities, which are eligible for the “routine agricultural use” reporting exemption provided in ss. 311 and 312 of EPCRA, shall be based on employee data which most closely reflects such owner or operator’s permanent nonseasonal workforce. The division shall establish by rule the date by which the fee is to be paid, as well as a formula or method of determining the applicable fee under this subsection without regard to the number of facilities under common ownership or control. The division may require owners or operators of multiple facilities to demonstrate common ownership or control for purposes of this subsection. (2) Any owner or operator of a facility required to notify or who has notified the commission under s. 302 of EPCRA shall pay a one-time filing fee of $50. Such fee shall be due at the time of initial notification. The fee under this subsection shall not be required for any agricultural facilities with a Standard Industrial Classification Code of 01, 02, or 07 subject to the notification or annual inventory form requirement solely because of the presence of EPCRA listed substances in temporary or portable storage units located at the facility for less than 48 consecutive hours. (3) Any owner or operator of a facility that is required to submit a report or filing under s. 313 of EPCRA shall pay an annual reporting fee not to exceed $150 for those s. 313 EPCRA listed substances in effect on January 1, 2005. The division shall establish by rule the date by which the fee is to be paid, as well as a formula or method of determining the applicable fee under this subsection. (4)(a) The division may assess a late fee for the failure to submit a report or filing that substantially complies with the requirements of EPCRA or s. 252.87 by the specified date or for failure to pay any fee, including any late fee, required by this section. This late fee shall be in addition to the fee otherwise imposed pursuant to this section. If the division elects to impose a late fee, it shall provide the owner or operator with a written notice that identifies the specific requirements which have not been met and advises of its intent to assess a late fee. (b) The division may impose a late fee, subject to the limitations set forth below: 1. If the report, filing, or fee is submitted within 30 days after the receipt of the division’s notice, no late fee may be assessed. 2. If the report, filing, or fee is not submitted within 30 days after the receipt of the division’s notice, the division may impose a late fee in an amount equal to the amount of the annual registration fee, filing fee, or s. 313 fee due, not to exceed $2,000. 3. If the report, filing, or fee is not submitted within 90 days after the receipt of the division’s notice, the division may issue a second notice. If the report, filing, or fee is not submitted within 30 days after receipt of the division’s second notice, the division may assess a second late fee in an amount equal to twice the amount of the annual registration fee, filing fee, or s. 313 fee due, not to exceed $4,000. 4. The division may consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors in assessing late fees: good faith attempt to comply; history of noncompliance; ability to pay or continue in business; threat to health and safety posed by noncompliance; and degree of culpability. (5) The division shall establish by rule the dates by which the fee is to be paid, as well as a formula or method of determining the facility registration fee and late fee.

The annual registration fee is due to the division upon initial submission of a stationary source’s Risk Management Plan to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and every April 1 thereafter. (b) Prior individual written notice shall be provided by United States mail by the division to owners or operators of specified stationary sources in the state subject to the requirements under s. 112(r)(7) to submit Risk Management Plans and corresponding state registration fees. This notice must include the requirements of the state fee schedule and must be mailed at least 90 days before the due date for the specified stationary source’s initial registration and Risk Management Plan submission year and at least 30 days before the registration fee due date for subsequent years. (c) The division shall establish a fee schedule for the specified stationary sources, upon the advice and consent of the commission. The annual registration fee must be based on a stationary source’s highest program level, as determined under the federal implementing regulations for s. 112(r)(7) and may not exceed the following: 1. Program 1 Stationary Sources, $100. Multiple Program 1 stationary sources which are under common ownership and which have the same single chemical process, shall pay a full fee for the first stationary source location and a 50 percent fee for subsequent locations with no owner of such multiple stationary sources paying more than $1,000. To be eligible for this multiple stationary source fee provision, one single fee payment must be submitted by the owner of the eligible multiple stationary source locations with a listing of the multiple stationary source locations and the single chemical process. 2. Program 2 Stationary Sources, $200. Multiple Program 2 stationary sources which are under common ownership and which have the same single chemical process, shall pay a full fee for the first three stationary source locations and a 50 percent fee for subsequent locations with no owner of such multiple stationary sources paying more than $2,000. Multiple Program 2 stationary sources which are under common ownership and which are classified under one of the following Standard Industrial Classification group numbers 01, 02, or 07 shall pay a full fee, not to exceed $100 for the first stationary source location and a 50 percent fee for subsequent locations with no owner of such multiple stationary sources paying more than $800. To be eligible for these multiple stationary source fee provisions, one single fee payment must be submitted by the owner of the eligible multiple stationary source locations with a listing of the multiple stationary source locations and the chemical process. 3. Program 3 Stationary Sources, $1,000. (d) Annual registration fees under this section are not required until after the division receives final delegation approval from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to administer the s. 112(r)(7) Accidental Release Prevention Program for the specified stationary sources. (2) The division shall establish late fees, not to exceed 10 percent per month of the annual registration fee owed, and not to exceed a total of 50 percent, for failure to timely submit an annual registration fee. A late fee may not be assessed against a stationary source during the initial registration and submission year if 90 days’ prior written notice was not provided to that stationary source. (3) In determining whether an annual registration fee is timely submitted under subsections (1) and (2), if the fee is: (a) Mailed via United States mail, the date of submittal is the date evidenced by the postmark. (b) Delivered by overnight or other private mail carriers, the date of submittal is the date the package is deposited with the overnight carrier. (c) Hand-delivered, other than by overnight or private mail carrier, the date of submittal is the date of actual receipt. (4) If the Legislature directs the division to seek authority to implement and enforce s. 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act for additional stationary sources, the division shall, with the advice of the commission, review and suggest revisions, if necessary and appropriate, to the fees specified in this section.
