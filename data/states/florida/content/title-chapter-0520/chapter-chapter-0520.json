If a motor vehicle retail installment seller has more than one location in the same county, only one license shall be required for that county. (2) An application for a license under this part must be submitted to the office in such form as the commission may prescribe by rule. The commission may require each applicant to provide any information reasonably necessary to determine the applicant’s eligibility for licensure. The applicant shall also provide information that the office requires concerning any officer, director, control person, member, partner, or joint venturer of the applicant or any person having the same or substantially similar status or performing substantially similar functions or any individual who is the ultimate equitable owner of a 10-percent or greater interest in the applicant. The office may require information concerning any such applicant or person, including, but not limited to, his or her full name and any other names by which he or she may have been known, age, social security number, residential history, qualifications, educational and business history, and disciplinary and criminal history. If the office determines that an application should be granted, it shall issue the license for a period not to exceed 2 years. A nonrefundable application fee of $175 shall accompany an initial application for the principal place of business and each application for a branch location of a retail installment seller who is required to be licensed under this chapter. An application is considered received for purposes of s. 120.60 upon receipt of a completed application form as prescribed by commission rule, a nonrefundable application fee of $175, and any other fee prescribed by law. (3) The nonrefundable renewal fee for a motor vehicle retail installment seller license shall be $175. The commission shall establish by rule biennial licensure periods and procedures for renewal of licenses. A license that is not renewed by the end of the biennium established by the commission shall revert from active to inactive status. An inactive license may be reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive upon filing a completed reactivation form, payment of the nonrefundable renewal fee, and payment of a reactivation fee equal to the nonrefundable renewal fee. A license that is not reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive automatically expires. (4) A licensee may not transact business as a motor vehicle retail installment seller except under the name by which it is licensed. Licenses issued under this part are not transferable or assignable. (5) The office may deny an initial application for a license under this part if the applicant or any officer, director, control person, member, partner, or joint venturer of the applicant is the subject of a pending criminal prosecution or governmental enforcement action, in any jurisdiction, until conclusion of such criminal prosecution or enforcement action. (6) Each seller shall designate and maintain an agent in this state for service of process.

(b) The terms of the vehicle value protection agreement, including, but not limited to, the purchase price to be paid by the contract holder, if any; the requirements for eligibility and conditions of coverage; and any exclusions. (c) Whether the vehicle value protection agreement may be canceled by the contract holder during a free-look period as defined in s. 520.152, and that, in the event of cancellation, the contract holder is entitled to a full refund of the purchase price, if any, so long as no benefits have been provided. (d) The procedure the contract holder must follow, if any, to obtain a benefit under the terms and conditions of the vehicle value protection agreement, including, if applicable, a telephone number, website, or mailing address where the contract holder may apply for a benefit. (e) Whether the vehicle value protection agreement is cancelable after the free-look period and the conditions under which it may be canceled, including the procedures for requesting any refund of the unearned purchase price paid by the contract holder. In the event that the agreement is cancelable, it must include the methodology for calculating any refund due of the unearned purchase price of the vehicle value protection agreement. (f) That the extension of credit, the terms of the credit, or the terms of the related motor vehicle sale or lease may not be conditioned upon the purchase of the vehicle value protection agreement. (2) A vehicle value protection agreement must state the terms, restrictions, or conditions governing cancellation of the vehicle value protection agreement before the termination or expiration date of the vehicle value protection agreement by either the provider or the contract holder. The provider of the vehicle value protection agreement shall mail a written notice to the contract holder at the last known address of the contract holder contained in the records of the provider at least 5 days before cancellation by the provider, which notice must state the effective date of the cancellation and the reason for the cancellation. However, such prior notice is not required if the reason for cancellation is nonpayment of the provider fee, a material misrepresentation by the contract holder to the provider or administrator, or a substantial breach of duties by the contract holder relating to the covered motor vehicle or its use. If a vehicle value protection agreement is canceled by the provider for a reason other than nonpayment of the provider fee, the provider must refund to the contract holder 100 percent of the unearned pro rata provider fee paid by the contract holder, if any.

(b) A person licensed by the office under part I. This paragraph exempts only a person licensed under part I from the licensure requirements of this section. This paragraph does not exempt the licensee from the other sections of this part, and any violations of those sections may subject the licensee to disciplinary action. (2) An application for a license under this part must be submitted to the office in such form as the commission may prescribe by rule. The commission may require each applicant to provide any information reasonably necessary to determine the applicant’s eligibility for licensure. The applicant shall also provide information that the office requires concerning any officer, director, control person, member, partner, or joint venturer of the applicant or any person having the same or substantially similar status or performing substantially similar functions or any individual who is the ultimate equitable owner of a 10-percent or greater interest in the applicant. The office may require information concerning any such applicant or person, including his or her full name and any other names by which he or she may have been known, age, social security number, residential history, qualifications, educational and business history, and disciplinary and criminal history. If the office determines that an application should be granted, it shall issue the license for a period not to exceed 2 years. A nonrefundable application fee of $175 shall accompany an initial application for the principal place of business and each application for a branch location of a retail installment seller. An application is considered received for purposes of s. 120.60 upon receipt of a completed application form as prescribed by commission rule, a nonrefundable application fee of $175, and any other fee prescribed by law. (3) The nonrefundable renewal fee for a retail seller license shall be $175. Biennial licensure periods and procedures for renewal of licenses may also be established by the commission by rule. A license that is not renewed at the end of the biennium established by the commission shall revert from active to inactive status. An inactive license may be reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive upon filing a completed reactivation form, payment of the nonrefundable renewal fee, and payment of a reactivation fee equal to the nonrefundable renewal fee. A license that is not reactivated within 6 months after becoming inactive automatically expires. (4) A licensee may not transact business as a retail installment seller except under the name by which it is licensed. A license issued under this part is not transferable or assignable. (5) The office may deny an initial application for a license under this part if the applicant or any officer, director, control person, member, partner, or joint venturer of the applicant is the subject of a pending criminal prosecution or governmental enforcement action, in any jurisdiction, until conclusion of such criminal prosecution or enforcement action. (6) Each seller shall designate and maintain an agent in this state for service of process.
